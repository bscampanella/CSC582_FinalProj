He did not earn very much, and\r\nhad to be out in all weathers and all day long. But Toby was of a\r\ncheerful disposition, and looked on the bright side of everything. His\r\ngreatest joy was his dear daughter Meg, who loved him dearly.\r\n\r\nOne cold day Toby had been trotting up and down in his usual place\r\nbefore the church, when the bells chimed twelve o'clock, which made Toby\r\nthink of dinner.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing,\" he remarked, \"more regular in coming round than\r\ndinner-time, and nothing less regular in coming round than dinner.\r\nThat's the great difference between 'em.\" He went on talking to himself\r\nnever noticing who was coming near to him.\r\n\r\n\"Why, father, father,\" said a pleasant voice, and Toby turned to find\r\nhis daughter's sweet, bright eyes close to his.\r\n\r\n\"Why, pet,\" said he, kissing her, \"what's-to-do? I didn't expect you\r\nto-day, Meg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither did I expect to come, father,\" said Meg, smiling. \"But here I\r\nam! And not alone, not alone!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you don't mean to say,\" observed Trotty, looking curiously at the\r\ncovered basket she carried, \"that you?----\"\r\n\r\n\"Smell it, father dear,\" said Meg; \"only smell it, and guess what it\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\nToby took the shortest possible sniff at the edge of the basket. \"Why,\r\nit's hot,\" he said.\r\n\r\nBut to Meg's great delight he could not guess what it was that smelt so\r\ngood. At last he exclaimed in triumph, \"Why, what am I a-thinking of?\r\nIt's tripe!\"\r\n\r\nAnd it was.\r\n\r\nJust as Toby was about to sit down to his dinner on the doorsteps of a\r\nbig house close by, the chimes rang out again, and Toby took off his hat\r\nand said, \"Amen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen to the bells, father?\"\r\n\r\n\"They broke in like a grace, my dear,\" said Trotty, \"they'd say a good\r\none if they could, I'm sure. Many's the kind thing they say to me. How\r\noften have I heard them bells say, 'Toby Veck, Toby Veck, keep a good\r\nheart, Toby!' A millions times? More!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I never!\" cried Meg.\r\n\r\nWhile Toby ate his unexpected dinner with immense relish, Meg told him\r\nhow her lover Richard, a young blacksmith, had brought his dinner to\r\nshare with her, and had begged her to marry him on New Year's Day, \"the\r\nbest and happiest day of the whole year.\"\r\n\r\n\"So,\" went on Meg, \"I wanted to make this a sort of holiday to you, as\r\nwell as a dear and happy day to me, father, and I made a little treat\r\nand brought it to surprise you.\"\r\n\r\nJust then, Richard himself came up to persuade Toby to agree to their\r\nplan; and almost at the same moment, a footman came out of the house and\r\nordered them all off the steps, and some gentleman came out who called\r\nup Trotty, and gave him a letter to carry.\r\n\r\nToby trotted off to a very grand house, where he was told to take the\r\nletter in to the gentleman. While he was waiting, he heard the letter\r\nread. It was from Alderman Cute, to tell Sir Joseph Bowley that one of\r\nhis tenants named Will Fern who had come to London to try and get work,\r\nhad been brought before him charged with sleeping in a shed, and asking\r\nif Sir Joseph wished him to be dealt leniently with or otherwise. To\r\nToby's great disappointment the answer was given that Will Fern might be\r\nsent to prison as a vagabond, though his only fault was poverty. On his\r\nway home, Toby ran against a man dressed like a countryman, carrying a\r\nfair-haired little girl. The man asked him the way to Alderman Cute's\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\"It's impossible,\" cried Toby, \"that your name is Will Fern?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my name,\" said the man.\r\n\r\nThereupon Toby told him what he had just heard, and said \"Don't go\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TROTTY VECK'S DINNER.\r\n  TOBY TOOK A SNIFF AT THE EDGE OF THE BASKET.]\r\n\r\nPoor Will told him how he could not make a living in the country, and\r\nhad come to London with his orphan niece to try and find a friend of her\r\nmother's and to endeavor to get some work, and wishing Toby a happy\r\nNew Year, was about to trudge wearily off again, when Trotty caught his\r\nhand saying--\r\n\r\n\"Stay! The New Year never can be happy to me if I see the child and you\r\ngo wandering away without a shelter for your heads. Come home with me.\r\nI'm a poor man, living in a poor place, but I can give you lodging for\r\none night and never miss it,\" and lifting up the pretty little one, he\r\ntrotted towards home, and rushing in, he set the child down before his\r\ndaughter. The little girl ran into her arms at once, while Trotty ran\r\nround the room, saying, \"Here we are and here we go. Here, Uncle Will,\r\ncome to the fire. Meg, my precious darling, where's the kettle? Here it\r\nis and here it goes, and it'll bile in no time!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, father!\" said Meg, \"you're crazy to-night, I think. Poor little\r\nfeet, how cold they are!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they're warmer now!\" exclaimed the child. \"They're quite warm now!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no,\" said Meg. \"We haven't rubbed 'em half enough. And when\r\nthey're done, we'll brush out the damp hair; and we'll bring some color\r\nto the poor pale face with fresh water; and then we'll be so gay and\r\nbrisk and happy!\"\r\n\r\nThe child sobbing, clasped her round the neck, saying, \"O Meg, O dear\r\nMeg!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious me!\" said Meg, presently, \"father's crazy! He's put the\r\ndear child's bonnet on the kettle, and hung the lid behind the door!\"\r\n\r\nTrotty hastily repaired this mistake, and went off to find some tea and\r\na rasher of bacon he fancied \"he had seen lying somewhere on the\r\nstairs.\" He soon came back and made the tea, and before long they were\r\nall enjoying the meal.\r\n\r\nAfter tea Meg took Lilian to bed, and Toby showed Will Fern where he was\r\nto sleep. Then he went to sit by the fire and read his paper, and fell\r\nasleep, to have a wonderful dream so terrible and sad, that it was a\r\ngreat relief when he woke to find Meg sitting near him, putting some\r\nribbons on her simple gown for her wedding, and looking so happy and\r\nyoung and blooming, that he jumped up to clasp her in his arms.\r\n\r\nBut somebody came rushing in between them, crying,--\"No! Not even you.\r\nThe first kiss of Meg in the New Year is mine. Meg, my precious prize,\r\na happy year! A life of happy years, my darling wife!\"\r\n\r\nThen in came Lilian and Will Fern, and a band of music with a flock of\r\nneighbors burst into the room, shouting, \"A Happy New Year, Meg.\" \"A\r\nhappy wedding!\" \"Many of 'em,\" and the Drum stepped forward and said--\r\n\r\n\"Trotty Veck, it's got about that your daughter is to be married\r\nto-morrow. And there ain't a soul that knows you both that don't wish\r\nyou both all the happiness the New Year can bring. And here we are, to\r\nplay it in and dance it in accordingly.\" Then Mrs. Chickenstalker came\r\nin (a good-humored, comely woman, who, to the delight of all, turned out\r\nto be the friend of Lilian's mother for whom Will Fern had come to\r\nlook), to wish Meg joy, and then the music struck up, and Trotty, making\r\nMeg and Richard second couple, led off Mrs. Chickenstalker down the\r\ndance, and danced it in a step unknown before or since, founded on his\r\nown peculiar trot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTINY TIM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a man who did not like Christmas. His name was Scrooge,\r\nand he was a hard sour-tempered man of business, intent only on saving\r\nand making money, and caring nothing for anyone. He paid the poor,\r\nhard-working clerk in his office as little as he could possibly get the\r\nwork done for, and lived on as little as possible himself, alone, in two\r\ndismal rooms. He was never merry or comfortable, or happy, and he hated\r\nother people to be so, and that was the reason why he hated Christmas,\r\nbecause people will be happy at Christmas, you know, if they possibly\r\ncan.\r\n\r\nWell, it was Christmas eve, a very cold and foggy one, and Mr. Scrooge,\r\nhaving given his poor clerk unwilling permission to spend Christmas day\r\nat home, locked up his office and went home himself in a very bad\r\ntemper. After having taken some gruel as he sat over a miserable fire in\r\nhis dismal room, he got into bed, and had some wonderful and\r\ndisagreeable dreams, to which we will leave him, whilst we see how Tiny\r\nTim, the son of his poor clerk, spent Christmas day.\r\n\r\nThe name of this clerk was Bob Cratchet. He had a wife and five other\r\nchildren beside Tim, who was a weak and delicate little cripple, gentle\r\nand patient and loving, with a sweet face of his own, which no one could\r\nhelp looking at.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Cratchet's delight to carry his little boy out on his\r\nshoulder to see the shops and the people; and to-day he had taken him to\r\nchurch for the first time.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever has got your precious father, and your brother Tiny Tim!\"\r\nexclaimed Mrs. Cratchet, \"here's dinner all ready to be dished up. I've\r\nnever known him so late on Christmas day before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here he is, mother!\" cried Belinda, and \"here he is!\" cried the other\r\nchildren, as Mr. Cratchet came in, his long comforter hanging three feet\r\nfrom under his threadbare coat; for cold as it was the poor clerk had no\r\ntop-coat. Tiny Tim was perched on his father's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"And how did Tim behave?\" asked Mrs. Cratchet.\r\n\r\n\"As good as gold and better,\" replied his father. \"He told me, coming\r\nhome, that he hoped the people in church, who saw he was a cripple,\r\nwould be pleased to remember on Christmas day who it was who made the\r\nlame to walk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless his sweet heart!\" said the mother in a trembling voice.\r\n\r\nDinner was waiting to be dished up. Mrs. Cratchet proudly placed a goose\r\nupon the table. Belinda brought in the apple sauce, and Peter the mashed\r\npotatoes; the other children set chairs, Tim's as usual close to his\r\nfather's; and Tim was so excited that he rapped the table with his\r\nknife, and carried \"Hurrah.\" After the goose came the pudding, all\r\nablaze, with its sprig of holly in the middle, and was eaten to the last\r\nmorsel; then apples and oranges were set upon the table, and a shovelful\r\nof chestnuts on the fire, and Mr. Cratchet served round some hot sweet\r\nstuff out of a jug as they closed round the fire, and said, \"A Merry\r\nChristmas to us all, my dears, God bless us.\" \"God bless us, every one,\"\r\nechoed Tiny Tim, and then they drank each other's health, and Mr.\r\nScrooge's health, and told stories and sang songs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TINY TIM.\r\n  TINY TIM WAS PERCHED ON HIS FATHER'S SHOULDER.]\r\n\r\nNow in one of Mr. Scrooge's dreams on Christmas eve a Christmas spirit\r\nshowed him his clerk's home; he saw them all, heard them drink his\r\nhealth, and he took special note of Tiny Tim himself.\r\n\r\nHow Mr. Scrooge spent Christmas day we do not know; but on Christmas\r\nnight he had more dreams, and the spirit took him again to his clerk's\r\npoor home.\r\n\r\nUpstairs, the father, with his face hidden in his hands, sat beside a\r\nlittle bed, on which lay a tiny figure, white and still. \"Tiny Tim died\r\nbecause his father was too poor to give him what was necessary to make\r\nhim well; _you_ kept him poor,\" said the dream-spirit to Mr. Scrooge.\r\nThe father kissed the cold, little face on the bed, and went\r\ndown-stairs, where the sprays of holly still remained about the humble\r\nroom; and taking his hat, went out, with a wistful glance at the little\r\ncrutch in the corner as he shut the door. Mr. Scrooge saw all this, but,\r\nwonderful to relate, he woke the next morning feeling as he had never\r\nfelt in his life before.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I am as light as a feather, and as happy as an angel, and as merry\r\nas a schoolboy,\" he said to himself. \"I hope everybody had a merry\r\nChristmas, and here's a happy New Year to all the world.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Bob Cratchet crept into the office a few minutes late, expecting to\r\nbe scolded for it, but his master was there with his back to a good\r\nfire, and actually smiling, and he shook hands with his clerk, telling\r\nhim heartily he was going to raise his salary, and asking quite\r\naffectionately after Tiny Tim! \"And mind you make up a good fire in your\r\nroom before you set to work, Bob,\" he said, as he closed his own door.\r\n\r\nBob could hardly believe his eyes and ears, but it was all true. Such\r\ndoings as they had on New Year's day had never been seen before in the\r\nCratchet's home, nor such a turkey as Mr. Scrooge sent them for dinner.\r\nTiny Tim had his share too, for Tiny Tim did not die, not a bit of it.\r\nMr. Scrooge was a second father to him from that day, he wanted for\r\nnothing, and grew up strong and hearty. Mr. Scrooge loved him, and well\r\nhe might, for was it not Tiny Tim who had unconsciously, through the\r\nChristmas dream-spirit, touched his hard heart, and caused him to become\r\na good and happy man?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE DOMBEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle Dombey was the son of a rich city merchant, a cold, stern, and\r\npompous man, whose life and interests were entirely absorbed in his\r\nbusiness. He was so desirous of having a son to associate with himself\r\nin the business, and make the house once more Dombey & Son in fact, as\r\nit was in name, that the little boy who was at last born to him was\r\neagerly welcomed.\r\n\r\nThere was a pretty little girl six years old, but her father had taken\r\nlittle notice of her. Of what use was a girl to Dombey & Son? She could\r\nnot go into the business.\r\n\r\nLittle Dombey's mother died when he was born, but the event did not\r\ngreatly disturb Mr. Dombey; and since his son lived, what did it matter\r\nto him that his little daughter Florence was breaking her heart in\r\nloneliness for the mother who had loved and cherished her!\r\n\r\nDuring the first few months of his life, little Dombey grew and\r\nflourished; and as soon as he was old enough to take notice, there was\r\nno one he loved so well as his sister Florence.\r\n\r\nIn due time the baby was taken to church, and baptized by the name of\r\nPaul (his father's name). A grand and stately christening it was,\r\nfollowed by a grand and stately feast; and little Paul was declared by\r\nhis godmother to be \"an angel, and the perfect picture of his own papa.\"\r\n\r\nBut from that time Paul seemed to waste and pine; his healthy and\r\nthriving babyhood had received a check, and as for illnesses, \"There\r\nnever was a blessed dear so put upon,\" his nurse said.\r\n\r\nBy the time he was five years old, though he had the prettiest, sweetest\r\nlittle face in the world, there was always a patient, wistful look upon\r\nit, and he was thin and tiny and delicate. He soon got tired, and had\r\nsuch old-fashioned ways of speaking and doing things, that his nurse\r\noften shook her head sadly over him.\r\n\r\nWhen he sat in his little arm-chair with his father, after dinner, they\r\nwere a strange pair,--so like, and so unlike each other.\r\n\r\n\"What is money, papa?\" asked Paul on one of these occasions, crossing\r\nhis tiny arms as well as he could--just as his father's were crossed.\r\n\r\n\"Why, gold, silver and copper; you know what it is well enough, Paul,\"\r\nanswered his father.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes; I mean, what can money do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything, everything--almost,\" replied Mr. Dombey, taking one of his\r\nson's wee hands.\r\n\r\nPaul drew his hand gently away. \"It didn't save me my mamma, and it\r\ncan't make me strong and big,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you _are_ strong and big, as big as such little people usually\r\nare,\" returned Mr. Dombey.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Paul, sighing; \"when Florence was as little as me, she was\r\nstrong and tall, and did not get tired of playing as I do. I am so tired\r\nsometimes, papa.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dombey's anxiety was aroused, and the doctor was sent for to examine\r\nPaul.\r\n\r\n\"The child is hardly so stout as we could wish,\" said the doctor; \"his\r\nmind is too big for his body, he thinks too much--let him try sea\r\nair--sea air does wonders for children.\"\r\n\r\nSo it was arranged that Florence, Paul, and nurse should go to Brighton,\r\nand stay in the house of a lady named Mrs. Pipchin, who kept a very\r\nselect boarding-house for children.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that, apart from his importance to the house of Dombey\r\n& Son, little Paul had crept into his father's heart, cold though it\r\nstill was towards his daughter, colder than ever now, for there was in\r\nit a sort of unacknowledged jealousy of the warm love lavished on her by\r\nPaul, which he himself was unable to win.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pipchin was a marvellously ugly old lady, with a hook nose and\r\nstern cold eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Master Paul, how do you think you will like me?\" said Mrs.\r\nPipchin, seeing the child intently regarding her.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I shall like you at all,\" replied Paul, shaking his head.\r\n\"I want to go away. I do not like your house.\"\r\n\r\nPaul did not like Mrs. Pipchin, but he would sit in his arm-chair and\r\nlook at her. Her ugliness seemed to fascinate him.\r\n\r\nAs the weeks went by little Paul grew more healthy-looking, but he did\r\nnot seem any stronger, and could not run about out of doors. A little\r\ncarriage was therefore got for him, in which he could be wheeled down to\r\nthe beach, where he would pass the greater part of the day. He took a\r\ngreat fancy to a queer crab-faced old man, smelling of sea-weed, who\r\nwheeled his carriage, and held long conversations with him; but Florence\r\nwas the only child companion whom he ever cared to have with him, though\r\nhe liked to watch other children playing in the distance.\r\n\r\n\"I love you, Floy,\" he said one day to her.\r\n\r\nFlorence laid her head against his pillow, and whispered how much\r\nstronger he was growing.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I know, I am a great deal better,\" said Paul, \"a very great\r\ndeal better. Listen, Floy; what is it the sea keeps saying?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, dear, it is only the rolling of the waves you hear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but they are always saying something, and always the same thing.\r\nWhat place is over there, Floy?\"\r\n\r\nShe told him there was another country opposite, but Paul said he did\r\nnot mean that, he meant somewhere much farther away, oh, much farther\r\naway--and often he would break off in the midst of their talk to listen\r\nto the sea and gaze out towards that country \"farther away.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having lived at Brighton for a year, Paul was certainly much\r\nstronger, though still thin and delicate. And on one of his weekly\r\nvisits, Mr. Dombey explained to Mrs. Pipchin, with pompous\r\ncondescension, that Paul's weak health having kept him back in his\r\nstudies, he had made arrangements to place him at the educational\r\nestablishment of Dr. Blimber, which was close by. Florence was, for the\r\npresent, to remain under Mrs. Pipchin's care, and see her brother every\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nDr. Blimber's school was a great hot-house for the forcing of boy's\r\nbrains; and Dr. Blimber promised speedily to make a man of Paul.\r\n\r\n\"Shall you like to be made a man of, my son?\" asked Mr. Dombey.\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather be a child and stay with Floy,\" answered Paul.\r\n\r\nMiss Blimber, the doctor's daughter, a learned lady in spectacles, was\r\nhis special tutor, and from morning till night his poor little brains\r\nwere forced and crammed till his head was heavy and always had a dull\r\nache in it, and his small legs grew weak again--every day he looked a\r\nlittle thinner and a little paler, and became more old-fashioned than\r\never in his looks and ways--\"old-fashioned\" was a distinguishing title\r\nwhich clung to him. He was gentle and polite to every one--always\r\nlooking out for small kindnesses which he might do to any inmate of the\r\nhouse. \"The oddest and most old-fashioned child in the world,\" Dr.\r\nBlimber would say to his daughter; \"but bring him on, Cornelia--bring\r\nhim on.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Cornelia did bring him on; and Florence, seeing how pale and weary\r\nthe little fellow looked when he came to her on Saturdays, and how he\r\ncould not rest from anxiety about his lessons, would lighten his labors\r\na little, and ease his mind by helping him to prepare his week's work.\r\nBut one day, when his lessons were over, little Paul laid his weary and\r\naching head against the knee of a schoolfellow of whom he was very fond;\r\nand the first thing he noticed when he opened his eyes was that the\r\nwindow was open, his face and hair were wet with water, and that Dr.\r\nBlimber and the usher were both standing looking at him.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's well,\" said Dr. Blimber, as Paul opened his eyes, \"and how\r\nis my little friend now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, quite well, thank you, sir,\" answered Paul, but when he got up\r\nthere seemed something the matter with the floor, and the walls were\r\ndancing about, and Dr. Blimber's head was twice its natural size. He was\r\nput to bed, and presently the doctor came and said he was not to do any\r\nmore lessons for the present.\r\n\r\nIn a few days Paul was able to get up and creep about the house. He\r\nwondered sometimes why every one looked at and spoke so very kindly to\r\nhim, and was more than ever careful to do any little kindnesses he could\r\nthink of for them: even the rough, ugly dog Diogenes, who lived in the\r\nyard, came in for a share of his attentions.\r\n\r\nThere was a party at Dr. Blimber's on the evening before the boys went\r\nhome. Paul sat in a corner of the sofa all the evening, and every one\r\nwas very kind to him indeed, it was quite extraordinary, Paul thought,\r\nand he was very happy; he liked to see how pretty Florence was, and how\r\nevery one admired and wished to dance with her. After resting for a\r\nnight at Mrs. Pipchin's house, little Paul went home, and was carried\r\nstraight upstairs to his bed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LITTLE PAUL AND FLORENCE.\r\n  A LITTLE CARRIAGE WAS GOT FOR HIM.]\r\n\r\nHe lay in his bed day after day quite happily and patiently, content\r\nto watch and talk to Florence. He would tell her his dreams, and how he\r\nalways saw the sunlit ripples of a river rolling, rolling fast in front\r\nof him; sometimes he seemed to be rocking in a little boat on the water,\r\nand its motion lulled him to rest, and then he would be floating away,\r\naway to that shore farther off, which he could not see. One day he told\r\nFlorence that the water was rippling brighter and faster than ever, and\r\nthat he could not see anything else.\r\n\r\n\"My own boy, cannot you see your poor father?\" said Mr. Dombey, bending\r\nover him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, but don't be so sorry, dear papa. I am so happy,--good-bye,\r\ndear papa.\" Presently he opened his eyes again, and said, \"Floy, mamma\r\nis like you, I can see her. Come close to me, Floy, and tell them,\"\r\nwhispered the dying boy, \"that the face of the picture of Christ on the\r\nstaircase at school is not divine enough; the light from it is shining\r\non me now, and the water is shining too, and rippling so fast, so fast.\"\r\n\r\nThe evening light shone into the room, but little Paul's spirit had gone\r\nout on the rippling water, and the Divine Face was shining on him from\r\nthe farther shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUNAWAY COUPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Supposing a young gentleman not eight years old was to run away with a\r\nfine young woman of seven, would you consider that a queer start? That\r\nthere is a start as I--the boots at the Holly-Tree Inn--have seen with\r\nmy own eyes; and I cleaned the shoes they ran away in, and they was so\r\nlittle that I couldn't get my hand into 'em.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE RUNAWAY COUPLE.]\r\n\r\n\"Master Harry Walmers's father, he lived at the Elms, away by Shooter's\r\nHill, six or seven miles from London. He was uncommon proud of Master\r\nHarry, as was his only child; but he didn't spoil him neither. He was a\r\ngentleman that had a will of his own, and an eye of his own, and that\r\nwould be minded. Consequently, though he made quite a companion of\r\nthe fine bright boy, still he kept the command over him, and the child\r\n_was_ a child. I was under gardener there at that time I and one morning\r\nMaster Harry, he comes to me and says--\r\n\r\n\"'Cobbs, how should you spell Norah, if you were asked?' and he took out\r\nhis little knife and began cutting that name in print all over the\r\nfence. The next day as it might be, he stops, along with Miss Norah,\r\nwhere I was hoeing weeds in the gravel, and says, speaking up--\r\n\r\n\"'Cobbs, I like you! Why do I like you do you think, Cobbs? Because Norah\r\nlikes you.'\r\n\r\n\"'Indeed, sir,' says I. 'That's very gratifying.'\r\n\r\n\"'Gratifying, Cobbs?' says Master Harry. 'It's better than a million of\r\nthe brightest diamonds, to be liked by Norah. You're going away ain't\r\nyou, Cobbs? Then you shall be our head gardener when we're married.' And\r\nhe tucks her, in her little sky-blue mantle, under his arm, and walks\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"I was the boots at this identical Holly-Tree Inn when one summer\r\nafternoon the coach drives up, and out of the coach gets these two\r\nchildren. The young gentleman gets out; hands his lady out; gives the\r\nguard something for himself; says to my governor, the landlord: 'We're\r\nto stop here to-night, please. Sitting room and two bed-rooms will be\r\nrequired. Mutton chops and cherry pudding for two!' and tucks her under\r\nhis arm, and walks into the house, much bolder than brass.\r\n\r\n\"I had seen 'em without their seeing me, and I gave the governor my\r\nviews of the expedition they was upon. 'Cobbs,' says the governor, 'if\r\nthis is so, I must set off myself and quiet their friends' minds. In\r\nwhich case you must keep your eye upon 'em, and humor 'em, until I come\r\nback. But before I take these measures, Cobbs, I should wish you to find\r\nout from themselves whether your opinion is correct.'\r\n\r\n\"So I goes upstairs, and there I finds Master Harry on an e-nor-mous\r\nsofa a-drying the eyes of Miss Norah with his pocket handkercher. Their\r\nlittle legs was entirely off the ground, of course, and it really is not\r\npossible to express how small them children looked. 'It's Cobbs! it's\r\nCobbs!' cries Master Harry, and he comes a-runing to me, and catching\r\nhold of my hand. Miss Norah, she comes running to me on t'other side,\r\nand catching hold of my t'other hand, and they both jump for joy. And\r\nwhat I had took to be the case was the case.\r\n\r\n\"'We're going to be married, Cobbs, at Gretna Green,' says the boy.\r\n'We've run away on purpose. Norah has been in rather low spirits, Cobbs;\r\nbut she'll be happy now we have found you to be our friend.'\r\n\r\n\"'I give you my word and honor upon it that, by way of luggage the lady\r\nhad got a parasol, a smelling-bottle, a round and a half of cold\r\nbuttered toast, eight peppermint drops, and a doll's hair-brush. The\r\ngentleman had got about a dozen yards of string, a knife, three or four\r\nsheets of writing-paper folded up surprisingly small, a orange, and a\r\nchaney mug with his name on it.\r\n\r\n\"'What may be the exact nature of your plans, sir?' says I.\r\n\r\n\"'To go on,' replies the boy, 'in the morning, and be married\r\nto-morrow.'\r\n\r\n\"'Just so, sir. Well, sir, if you will excuse my having the freedom to\r\ngive an opinion, what I should recommend would be this. I'm acquainted\r\nwith a pony, sir, which would take you and Mrs. Harry Walmers junior to\r\nthe end of your journey in a very short space of time. I am not\r\naltogether sure, sir, that the pony will be at liberty to-morrow, but\r\neven if you had to wait for him it might be worth your while.'\r\n\r\n\"They clapped their hands and jumped for joy, and called me 'Good\r\nCobbs!' and 'Dear Cobbs!' and says I, 'Is there anything you want at\r\npresent, sir?'\r\n\r\n\"'We should like some cakes after dinner,' answers Mr. Harry, 'and two\r\napples--and jam. With dinner we should like to have toast and water. But\r\nNorah has always been accustomed to half a glass of currant wine at\r\ndessert, and so have I.'\r\n\r\n\"'They shall be ordered, sir,' I answered, and away I went; and the way\r\nin which all the women in the house went on about that boy and his bold\r\nspirit was a thing to see. They climbed up all sorts of places to get a\r\nlook at him, and they peeped, seven deep, through the keyhole.\r\n\r\n\"In the evening, after the governor had set off for the Elms, I went into\r\nthe room to see how the run-away couple was getting on. The gentleman\r\nwas on the window seat, supporting the lady in his arms. She had tears\r\nupon her face, and was lying very tired and half asleep, with her head\r\nupon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"'Mrs. Harry Walmers junior fatigued, sir?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, she's tired, Cobbs; she's been in low spirits again; she isn't\r\nused to being in a strange place, you see. Could you bring a Norfolk\r\nbiffin, Cobbs? I think that would do her good.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, I fetched the biffin, and Master Harry fed her with a spoon; but\r\nthe lady being heavy with sleep and rather cross, I suggested bed, and\r\ncalled a chambermaid, but Master Harry must needs escort her himself,\r\nand carry the candle for her. After embracing her at her own door he\r\nretired to his room, where I softly locked him in.\r\n\r\n\"They consulted me at breakfast (they had ordered sweet milk and water,\r\nand toast and currant jelly, over night) about the pony, and I told 'em\r\nthat it did unfortunately happen that the pony was half clipped, but\r\nthat he'd be finished clipping in the course of the day, and that\r\nto-morrow morning at eight o'clock he would be ready. My own opinion is\r\nthat Mrs. Harry Walmers junior was beginning to give in. She hadn't had\r\nher hair curled when she went to bed, and she didn't seem quite up to\r\nbrushing it herself, and it getting into her eyes put her out. But\r\nnothing put out Mr. Harry. He sat behind his breakfast cup tearing away\r\nat the jelly, as if he'd been his own father.\r\n\r\n\"In the course of the morning, Master Harry rung the bell,--it was\r\nsurprising how that there boy did carry on,--and said in a sprightly\r\nway, 'Cobbs, is there any good walks in the neighborhood?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, sir, there's Love Lane.'\r\n\r\n\"'Get out with you, Cobbs!'--that was that there mite's\r\nexpression--'you're joking.'\r\n\r\n\"'Begging your pardon, sir, there really is a Love Lane, and a pleasant\r\nwalk it is; and proud shall I be to show it to yourself and Mrs. Harry\r\nWalmers junior.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, I took him down Love Lane to the water meadows, and there Master\r\nHarry would have drowned himself in another minute a getting out a\r\nwater-lily for her. But they was tired out. All being so new and strange\r\nto them, they were as tired as tired could be. And they laid down on a\r\nbank of daisies and fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\"They woke up at last, and then one thing was getting pretty clear to\r\nme, namely, that Mrs. Harry Walmers junior's temper was on the move.\r\nWhen Master Harry took her round the waist, she said he 'teased her so';\r\nand when he says, 'Norah, my young May moon, your Harry tease you?' she\r\ntells him, 'Yes, and I want to go home.'\r\n\r\n\"A boiled fowl, and baked bread and butter pudding, brought Mrs. Walmers\r\nup a little; but I could have wished, I must privately own, to have seen\r\nher more sensible to the voice of love and less abandoning herself to\r\nthe currants in the pudding. However, Master Harry, he kep' up, and his\r\nnoble heart was as fond as ever. Mrs. Walmers turned very sleepy about\r\ndusk, and began to cry. Therefore, Mrs. Walmers went off to bed as per\r\nyesterday; and Master Harry ditto repeated.\r\n\r\n\"About eleven at night comes back the governor in a chaise, along of\r\nMaster Harry's father and a elderly lady. And Master Harry's door being\r\nunlocked by me, Master Harry's father goes in, goes up to the bedside,\r\nbends gently down, and kisses the little sleeping face. Then he stands\r\nlooking at it for a moment, looking wonderfully like it; and then he\r\ngently shakes the little shoulder. 'Harry, my dear boy! Harry!'\r\n\r\n\"Master Harry starts up and looks at his pa. Such is the honor of that\r\nmite, that he looks at me, too, to see whether he has brought me into\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\"'I am not angry, my child. I only want you to dress yourself and come\r\nhome.'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, Pa.' Master Harry dresses himself quick.\r\n\r\n\"'Please may I--please, dear pa--may I--kiss Norah before I go?'\r\n\r\n\"Master Harry's father he takes Master Harry in his hand, and I leads\r\nthe way with the candle to that other bedroom where the elderly lady is\r\nseated by the bed, and poor little Mrs. Harry Walmers junior is fast\r\nasleep. There the father lifts the boy up to the pillow, and he lays his\r\nlittle face down for an instant by the little warm face of poor little\r\nMrs. Harry Walmers junior, and gently draws it to him.\r\n\r\n\"And that's all about it. Master Harry's father drove away in the chaise\r\nhaving hold of Master Harry's hand. The elderly lady Mrs. Harry Walmers\r\njunior that was never to be (she married a captain long after and went\r\nto India) went off next day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOOR JO!\r\n\r\n\r\nJo was a crossing-sweeper; every day he swept up the mud, and begged for\r\npennies from the people who passed. Poor Jo wasn't pretty and he wasn't\r\nclean. His clothes were only a few poor rags that hardly protected him\r\nfrom the cold and the rain. He had never been to school, and he could\r\nneither write nor read--could not even spell his own name.\r\n\r\nPoor Jo! He was ugly and dirty and ignorant; but he knew one thing, that\r\nit was wicked to tell a lie, and knowing this, he always told the truth.\r\nOne other thing poor Jo knew too well, and that was what being hungry\r\nmeans. For little Jo was very poor. He lived in Tom-all-Alones, one of\r\nthe most horrible places in all London. The people who live in this\r\ndreadful den are the poorest of London poor. All miserably clad, all\r\ndirty, all very hungry. They know and like Jo, for he is always willing\r\nto go on errands for them, and does them many little acts of kindness.\r\n\r\nNo one in Tom-all-Alones is spoken of by his name. Thus it is that if\r\nyou inquired there for a boy named Jo, you would be asked whether you\r\nmeant Carrots, or the Colonel, or Gallows, or young Chisel, or Terrier\r\nTip, or Lanky, or the Brick.\r\n\r\nJo was generally called Toughy, although a few superior persons who\r\naffected a dignified style of speaking called him \"the tough subject.\"\r\n\r\nJo used to say he had never had but one friend.\r\n\r\nIt was one cold Winter night, when he was shivering in a door-way near\r\nhis crossing, that a dark-haired, rough-bearded man turned to look at\r\nhim, and then came back and began to talk to him.\r\n\r\n\"Have you a friend, boy?\" he asked presently.\r\n\r\n\"No, never 'ad none.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither have I. Not one. Take this, and Good-night,\" and so saying the\r\nman, who looked very poor and shabby, put into Jo's hand the price of a\r\nsupper and a night's lodging.\r\n\r\nOften afterwards the stranger would stop to talk with Jo, and give him\r\nmoney, Jo firmly believed, whenever he had any to give. When he had\r\nnone, he would merely say, \"I am as poor as you are to-day, Jo,\" and\r\npass on.\r\n\r\nOne day, Jo was fetched away from his crossing to a public-house, where\r\nthe Coroner was holding an Inquest--an \"Inkwich\" Jo called it.\r\n\r\n\"Did the boy know the deceased?\" asked the Coroner.\r\n\r\nIndeed Jo had known him; it was his only friend who was dead.\r\n\r\n\"He was very good to me, he was,\" was all poor Jo could say.\r\n\r\nThe next day they buried the dead man in the churchyard hard by.\r\n\r\nBut that night there came a slouching figure through the court to the\r\niron gate. It stood looking in for a little while, then with an old\r\nbroom it softly swept the step and made the archway clean. It was poor\r\nJo; and as he went away, he softly said to himself, \"He was very good to\r\nme, he was.\"\r\n\r\nNow, there happened to be at the Inquest a kind-hearted little man named\r\nSnagsby, and he pitied Jo so much that he gave him half-a-crown.\r\n\r\nJo was very sad after the death of his one friend. The more so as his\r\nfriend had died in great poverty and misery, with no one near him to\r\ncare whether he lived or not.\r\n\r\nA few days after the funeral, while Jo was still living on Mr. Snagsby's\r\nhalf-crown, he was standing at his crossing as the day closed in, when a\r\nlady, closely veiled and plainly dressed, came up to him.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the boy Jo who was examined at the Inquest?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"That's me,\" said Jo.\r\n\r\n\"Come farther up the court, I want to speak to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wot, about him as was dead? Did you know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"How dare you ask me if I knew him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No offence, my lady,\" said Jo humbly.\r\n\r\n\"Listen and hold your tongue. Show me the place where he lived, then\r\nwhere he died, then where they buried him. Go in front of me, don't look\r\nback once, and I'll pay you well.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: JO AND THE POLICEMAN.\r\n  \"I'M ALWAYS A MOVING ON.\"]\r\n\r\nJo takes her to each of the places she wants to see. Then she draws off\r\nher glove, and Jo sees that she has sparkling rings on her fingers. She\r\ndrops a coin into his hand and is gone. Jo holds the coin to the light\r\nand sees to his joy that it is a golden sovereign.\r\n\r\nBut people in Jo's position in life find it hard to change a sovereign,\r\nfor who will believe that they can come by it honestly? So poor little\r\nJo didn't get much of the sovereign for himself, for, as he afterwards\r\ntold Mr. Snagsby--\r\n\r\n\"I had to pay five bob down in Tom-all-Alones before they'd square it\r\nfor to give me change, and then a young man he thieved another five\r\nwhile I was asleep, and a boy he thieved ninepence, and the landlord he\r\nstood drains round with a lot more of it.\"\r\n\r\nAs time went on Jo's troubles began in earnest. The police turned him\r\naway from his crossing, and wheresoever they met him ordered him \"to\r\nmove on.\"\r\n\r\nOnce a policeman, angry to find that Jo hadn't moved on, seized him by\r\nthe arm and dragged him down to Mr. Snagsby's.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, constable?\" asked Mr. Snagsby.\r\n\r\n\"This boy's as obstinate a young gonoph as I know: although repeatedly\r\ntold to, he won't move on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm always amoving on,\" cried Jo. \"Oh, my eye, where am I to move to?\"\r\n\r\n\"My instructions don't go to that,\" the constable answered; \"my\r\ninstructions are that you're to keep moving on. Now the simple question\r\nis, sir,\" turning to Mr. Snagsby, \"whether you know him. He says you\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I leave him here; but mind you keep moving on.\"\r\n\r\nThe constable then moved on himself, leaving Jo at Mr. Snagsby's. There\r\nwas a little tea-party there that evening, and when Jo was at last\r\nallowed to go, Mr. Snagsby followed him to the door and filled his hands\r\nwith the remains of the little feast they had had upstairs.\r\n\r\nAnd now Jo began to find life harder and rougher than ever. He lost his\r\ncrossing altogether, and spent day after day in moving on. He remembered\r\na poor woman he had once done a kindness to, who had told him she lived\r\nat St. Albans, and that a lady there had been very good to her. \"Perhaps\r\nshe'll be good to me,\" thought Jo, and he started off to go to St.\r\nAlbans.\r\n\r\nOne Saturday night Jo reached that town very tired and very ill. Happily\r\nfor him the woman met him and took him into her cottage. While he was\r\nresting there a lady came in and asked him very kindly what was the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\"I'm abeing froze and then burnt up, and then froze and burnt up again,\r\never so many times over in an hour. And my head's all sleepy, and all\r\nagoing round like, and I'm so dry, and my bones is nothing half so much\r\nbones as pain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"Somewheres,\" replied Jo, \"I'm a-being moved on, I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, to-night you must come with me, and I'll make you comfortable.\"\r\nSo Jo went with the lady to a great house not far off, and there they\r\nmade a bed for him, and brought him tempting wholesome food. Everyone\r\nwas very kind to him, but something frightened Jo, and he felt he could\r\nnot stay there, and he ran out into the cold night air. Where he went he\r\ncould never remember, for when he next came to his senses he found\r\nhimself in a hospital. He stayed there for some weeks, and was then\r\ndischarged, though still weak and ill. He was very thin, and when he\r\ndrew a breath his chest was very painful. \"It draws,\" said Jo, \"as heavy\r\nas a cart.\"\r\n\r\nNow, a certain young doctor who was very kind to poor people, was\r\nwalking through Tom-all-Alones one morning, when he saw a ragged figure\r\ncoming along, crouching close to the dirty wall. It was Jo. The young\r\ndoctor took pity on Jo. \"Come with me,\" he said, \"and I will find you a\r\nbetter place than this to stay in,\" for he saw that the lad was very,\r\nvery ill. So Jo was taken to a clean little room, and bathed, and had\r\nclean clothes, and good food, and kind people about him once more, but\r\nhe was too ill now, far too ill, for anything to do him any good.\r\n\r\n\"Let me lie here quiet,\" said poor Jo, \"and be so kind anyone as is\r\npassin' nigh where I used to sweep, as to say to Mr. Snagsby as Jo, wot\r\nhe knew once, is amoving on.\"\r\n\r\nOne day the young doctor was sitting by him, when suddenly Jo made a\r\nstrong effort to get out of bed.\r\n\r\n\"Stay, Jo--where now?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's time for me to go to that there burying-ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"What burying-ground, Jo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where they laid him as was very good to me, very good to me indeed he\r\nwas. It's time for me to go down to that there burying-ground, sir, and\r\nask to be put along of him. I wants to go there and be buried. Will you\r\npromise to have me took there and laid along with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thankee, sir. There's a step there as I used to sweep with my broom.\r\nIt's turned very dark, sir, is there any light coming?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's coming fast, Jo.\"\r\n\r\nThen silence for a while.\r\n\r\n\"Jo, my poor fellow----!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can hear you, sir, in the dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jo, can you say what I say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll say anything you say, sir, for I knows it's good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our Father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our Father--yes, that's very good, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which art in Heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Art in Heaven. Is the light a-coming, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's close at hand. Hallowed be Thy name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hallowed be Thy\"--\r\n\r\nThe light had come. Oh yes! the light had come, for Jo was dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE KENWIGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Kenwigs was the wife of an ivory turner, and though they only had a\r\nvery humble home of two rooms in a dingy-looking house in a small\r\nstreet, they had great pretensions to being \"genteel.\" The little Miss\r\nKenwigs had their flaxen hair plaited into pig-tails and tied with blue\r\nribbons, and wore little white trousers with frills round their ankles,\r\nthe highest fashion of that day; besides being dressed with such\r\nelegance, the two eldest girls went twice a week to a dancing school.\r\nMrs. Kenwigs, too, had an uncle who collected the water rate, and she\r\nwas therefore considered a person of great distinction, with quite the\r\nmanners of a lady. On the eighth anniversary of their wedding day, Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Kenwigs invited a party of friends to supper to celebrate the\r\noccasion. The four eldest children were to be allowed to sit up to\r\nsupper, and the uncle, Mr. Lillyvick, had promised to come. The baby was\r\nput to bed in a little room lent by one of the lady guests, and a little\r\ngirl hired to watch him. All the company had assembled when a ring was\r\nheard, and Morleena, whose name had been _invented by Mrs. Kenwigs_\r\nspecially for her, ran down to open the door and lead in her\r\ndistinguished great-uncle, then the supper was brought in.\r\n\r\nThe table was cleared; Mr. Lillyvick established in the arm-chair by the\r\nfireside; the four little girls arranged on a small form in front of the\r\ncompany with their flaxen tails towards them; Mrs. Kenwigs was suddenly\r\ndissolved in tears and sobbed out--\r\n\r\n\"They are so beautiful!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear,\" said all the ladies, \"so they are; it's very natural you\r\nshould feel proud of that; but don't give way, don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can--not help it, and it don't signify,\" sobbed Mrs. Kenwigs: \"oh!\r\nthey're too beautiful to live, much too beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing this dismal prophecy, all four little girls screamed until\r\ntheir light flaxen tails vibrated again, and rushed to bury their heads\r\nin their mother's lap.\r\n\r\nAt length she was soothed, and the children calmed down; while the\r\nladies and gentlemen all said they were sure they would live for many\r\nmany years, and there was no occasion for their mother's distress: and\r\nas the children were not so remarkably lovely, this was quite true.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Lillyvick talked to the company about his niece's marriage, and\r\nsaid graciously that he had always found Mr. Kenwigs a very honest,\r\nwell-behaved, upright, and respectable sort of man, and shook hands with\r\nhim, and then Morleena and her sisters kissed their uncle and most of\r\nthe guests.\r\n\r\nThen Miss Petowker, who could sing and recite in a way that brought\r\ntears to Mrs. Kenwigs' eyes, remarked--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear Mrs. Kenwigs, while Mr. Noggs is making that punch to drink\r\nhappy returns in, do let Morleena go through that figure dance before\r\nMr. Lillyvick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll tell you what,\" said Mrs. Kenwigs. \"Morleena shall do the\r\nsteps, if uncle can persuade Miss Petowker to recite us the\r\n'Blood-Drinker's Burial' afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone clapped their hands and stamped their feet at this proposal,\r\nbut Miss Petowker said, \"You know I dislike doing anything professional\r\nat private parties.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but not here!\" said Mrs. Kenwigs. \"You might as well be going\r\nthrough it in your own room: besides, the occasion.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't resist that,\" interrupted Miss Petowker, \"anything in my humble\r\npower, I shall be delighted to do.\"\r\n\r\nIn reality Mrs. Kenwigs and Miss Petowker had arranged all the\r\nentertainment between them beforehand, but had settled that a little\r\npressing on each side would look more natural. Then Miss Petowker hummed\r\na tune, and Morleena danced. It was a very beautiful figure, with a\r\ngreat deal of work for the arms, and gained much applause. Then Miss\r\nPetowker was entreated to begin her recitation, so she let down her back\r\nhair, and went through the performance with great spirit, and died\r\nraving mad in the arms of a bachelor friend who was to rush out and\r\ncatch her at the words \"in death expire,\" to the great delight of the\r\naudience and the terror of the little Kenwigses, who were nearly\r\nfrightened into fits.\r\n\r\nJust as the punch was ready, a knock at the door startled them all. But\r\nit was only a friend of Mr. Noggs, who lived upstairs, and who had come\r\ndown to say that Mr. Noggs was wanted.\r\n\r\nMr. Noggs hurried out, saying he would be back soon, and presently\r\nstartled them all by rushing in, snatching up a candle and a tumbler of\r\nhot punch, and darting out again.\r\n\r\nNow, it happened unfortunately that the tumbler of punch was the very\r\none that Mr. Lillyvick was just going to lift to his lips, and the great\r\nman--the rich relation--who had it in his power to make Morleena and her\r\nsisters heiresses--and whom everyone was most anxious to please--was\r\noffended.\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Kenwigs endeavored to soothe him, but only made matters worse.\r\nMr. Lillyvick demanded his hat, and was only induced to remain by Mrs.\r\nKenwigs' tears and the entreaties of the entire company.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE LITTLE KENWIGS.\r\n  \"THEY ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.\"]\r\n\r\n\"There, Kenwigs,\" said Mr. Lillyvick, \"and let me tell you, to show you\r\nhow much out of temper I was, that if I had gone away without another\r\nword, it would have made no difference respecting that pound or two\r\nwhich I shall leave among your children when I die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Morleena Kenwigs,\" cried her mother, \"go down on your knees to your\r\ndear uncle, and beg him to love you all his life through; for he's more\r\nan angel than a man, and I've always said so.\"\r\n\r\nJust as all were happy again, everyone was startled by a rapid\r\nsuccession of the loudest and shrillest shrieks, apparently coming from\r\nthe room where the baby was asleep.\r\n\r\n\"My baby, my blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed baby! My own darling,\r\nsweet, innocent Lillyvick! Let me go-o-o-o,\" screamed Mrs. Kenwigs.\r\n\r\nMr. Kenwigs rushed out, and was met at the door of the bedroom by a\r\nyoung man with the baby (upside down) in his arms, who came out so\r\nquickly that he knocked Mr. Kenwigs down; handing the child to his\r\nmother, he said, \"Don't be alarmed, it's all out, it's all over--the\r\nlittle girl, being tired, I suppose, fell asleep and set her hair on\r\nfire. I heard her cries and ran up in time to prevent her setting fire\r\nto anything else. The child is not hurt: I took it off the bed myself\r\nand brought it here to convince you.\"\r\n\r\nAfter they had all talked over this last excitement, and discussed\r\nlittle Lillyvick's deliverer, the collector pulled out his watch and\r\nannounced that it was nearly two o'clock, and as the poor children had\r\nbeen for some time obliged to keep their little eyes open with their\r\nlittle forefingers, the company took leave, declaring they had never\r\nspent such a delightful evening, and that they wished Mr. and Mrs.\r\nKenwigs had a wedding-day once a week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE DORRIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany years ago, when people could be put in prison for debt, a poor\r\ngentleman, who was unfortunate enough to lose all his money, was brought\r\nto the Marshalsea prison. As there seemed no prospect of being able to\r\npay his debts, his wife and their two little children came to live there\r\nwith him. The elder child was a boy of three; the younger a little girl\r\nof two years old, and not long afterwards another little girl was born.\r\nThe three children played in the courtyard, and were happy, on the\r\nwhole, for they were too young to remember a happier state of things.\r\n\r\nBut the youngest child, who had never been outside the prison walls, was\r\na thoughtful little creature, and wondered what the outside world could\r\nbe like. Her great friend, the turnkey, who was also her godfather,\r\nbecame very fond of her, and as soon as she could walk and talk, he\r\nbought a little arm-chair and stood it by his fire at the lodge, and\r\ncoaxed her with cheap toys to come and sit with him.\r\n\r\nOne day, she was sitting in the lodge gazing wistfully up at the sky\r\nthrough the barred window. The turnkey, after watching her some time,\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"Thinking of the fields, ain't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are they?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Why, they're--over there, my dear,\" said the turnkey, waving his key\r\nvaguely, \"just about there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does anybody open them and shut them? Are they locked?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the turnkey, discomfited, \"not in general.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they pretty, Bob?\" She called him Bob, because he wished it.\r\n\r\n\"Lovely. Full of flowers. There's buttercups, and there's daisies, and\r\nthere's--\" here he hesitated, not knowing the names of many\r\nflowers--\"there's dandelions, and all manner of games.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it very pleasant to be there, Bob?\"\r\n\r\n\"Prime,\" said the turnkey.\r\n\r\n\"Was father ever there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hem!\" coughed the turnkey. \"O yes, he was there, sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he sorry not to be there now?\"\r\n\r\n\"N--not particular,\" said the turnkey.\r\n\r\n\"Nor any of the people?\" she asked, glancing at the listless crowd\r\nwithin. \"O are you quite sure and certain, Bob?\"\r\n\r\nAt this point, Bob gave in and changed the subject. But after this chat,\r\nthe turnkey and little Amy would go out on his free Sunday afternoons to\r\nsome meadows or green lanes, and she would pick grass and flowers to\r\nbring home, while he smoked his pipe.\r\n\r\nWhen Amy was only eight years old, her mother died, and the poor father\r\nwas more helpless and broken-down than ever, and as Fanny was a careless\r\nchild, and Edward idle, the little one, who had the bravest and truest\r\nheart, was inspired by her love and unselfishness to be the little\r\nmother of the forlorn family, and struggled to get some little education\r\nfor herself and her brother and sister. She went as often as she could\r\nto an evening school outside, and managed to get her brother and sister\r\nsent to a day-school at intervals, during three or four years. At\r\nthirteen, she could read and keep accounts. Once, amongst the debtors, a\r\ndancing-master came in, and as Fanny had a great desire to learn\r\ndancing, little Amy went timidly to the new prisoner, and said,\r\n\r\n\"If you please, I was born here, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! You are the young lady, are you?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what can I do for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing for me, sir, thank you; but if, while you stay here, you could\r\nbe so kind as to teach my sister cheap.\"\r\n\r\n\"My child, I'll teach her for nothing,\" said the dancing-master.\r\n\r\nFanny was a very apt pupil, and the good-natured dancing-master went on\r\ngiving her lessons even after his release, and Amy was so emboldened\r\nwith the success of her attempt that, when a milliner came in, she went\r\nto her on her own behalf, and begged her to teach her.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid you are so weak, you see,\" the milliner objected.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I am weak, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are so very, very little, you see,\" the milliner still\r\nobjected.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE BLIND TOY MAKER.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LITTLE DORRIT AND MAGGIE.\r\n  \"SHE HAS NEVER GROWN OLDER SINCE.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am afraid I am very little indeed,\" returned the child, and\r\nbegan to sob, so that the milliner was touched, and took her in hand and\r\nmade her a clever workwoman.\r\n\r\nBut the father could not bear the idea that his children should work for\r\ntheir living, so they had to keep it all secret. Fanny became a dancer,\r\nand lived with a poor old uncle, who played the clarionet at the small\r\ntheatre where Fanny was engaged. Amy, or little Dorrit as she was\r\ngenerally called, her father's name being Dorrit, earned small sums by\r\ngoing out to do needlework. She got Edward into a great many situations,\r\nbut he was an idle, careless fellow, and always came back to be a burden\r\nand care to his poor little sister. At last she saved up enough to send\r\nhim out to Canada.\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, dear Tip\" (his name had been shortened to Tip), \"don't\r\nbe too proud to come and see us when you have made your fortune,\" she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nBut Tip only went as far as Liverpool, and appeared once more before his\r\npoor little second mother, in rags, and with no shoes.\r\n\r\nIn the end, after another trial, Tip returned telling Amy, that this\r\ntime he was \"one of the regulars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Don't say you are a prisoner, Tip. Don't, don't!\"\r\n\r\nBut he was--and Amy nearly broke her heart. So with all these cares and\r\nworries struggling bravely on, little Dorrit passed the first twenty-two\r\nyears of her life. Then the son of a lady, Mrs. Clennem, to whose house\r\nAmy went to do needlework, was interested in the pale, patient little\r\ncreature, and learning her history resolved to do his best to try and\r\nget her father released, and to help them all.\r\n\r\nOne day when he was walking home with little Dorrit a voice was heard\r\ncalling, \"Little Mother, Little Mother,\" and a strange figure came\r\nbouncing up to them and fell down, scattering her basketful of potatoes\r\non the ground. \"Oh Maggie,\" said Little Dorrit, \"what a clumsy child you\r\nare!\"\r\n\r\nShe was about eight and twenty, with large bones, large features, large\r\nhands and feet, large eyes and no hair. Little Dorrit told Mr. Clennem\r\nthat Maggie was the grand-daughter of her old nurse, and that her\r\ngrandmother had been very unkind to her and beat her. \"When Maggie was\r\nten years old, she had a fever, and she has never grown older since.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten years old,\" said Maggie. \"But what a nice hospital! So comfortable\r\nwasn't it? Such a Ev'nly place! Such beds there is there! Such\r\nlemonades! Such oranges! Such delicious broth and wine! Such chicking!\r\nOh, AIN'T it a delightful place to stop at!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then when she came out, her grandmother did not know what to do with\r\nher, and was very unkind. But after some time, Maggie tried to improve,\r\nand was very attentive and industrious, and now she can earn her own\r\nliving entirely, sir!\"\r\n\r\nLittle Dorrit did not say who had taken pains to teach and encourage the\r\npoor half-witted creature, but Mr. Clennem guessed from the name Little\r\nMother, and the fondness of the poor creature for Amy.\r\n\r\nThanks to Mr. Clennem, a great change took place in the fortunes of the\r\nfamily, and not long after this wretched night, it was discovered that\r\nMr. Dorrit was owner of a large property, and they became very rich.\r\n\r\nWhen, in his turn, Mr. Clennem became a prisoner in the Marshalsea\r\nlittle Dorrit came to comfort and console him, and after many changes of\r\nfortune, she became his wife, and they lived happy ever after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLIND TOY-MAKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaleb Plummer and his blind daughter lived alone in a little cracked\r\nnutshell of a house. They were toy-makers, and their house was stuck\r\nlike a toadstool on to the premises of Messrs. Gruff & Tackleton, the\r\nToy Merchants for whom they worked,--the latter of whom was himself both\r\nGruff and Tackleton in one.\r\n\r\nI am saying that Caleb and his blind daughter lived here. I should say\r\nCaleb did, his daughter lived in an enchanted palace, which her father's\r\nlove had created for her. She did not know that the ceilings were\r\ncracked, the plaster tumbling down, and the wood work rotten; that\r\neverything was old and ugly and poverty-stricken about her and that her\r\nfather was a grey-haired stooping old man, and the master for whom they\r\nworked a hard and brutal taskmaster;--oh, dear no, she fancied a pretty,\r\ncosy, compact little home full of tokens of a kind master's care, a\r\nsmart, brisk, gallant-looking father, and a handsome and noble-looking\r\nToy Merchant who was an angel of goodness.\r\n\r\nThis was all Caleb's doings. When his blind daughter was a baby he had\r\ndetermined in his great love and pity for her, that her deprivation\r\nshould be turned into a blessing, and her life as happy as he could make\r\nit. And she was happy; everything about her she saw with her father's\r\neyes, in the rainbow-coloured light with which it was his care and\r\npleasure to invest it.\r\n\r\nBertha sat busily at work, making a doll's frock, whilst Caleb bent over\r\nthe opposite side of the table painting a doll's house.\r\n\r\n\"You were out in the rain last night in your beautiful new great-coat,\"\r\nsaid Bertha.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in my beautiful new great-coat,\" answered Caleb, glancing to where\r\na roughly made garment of sack-cloth was hung up to dry.\r\n\r\n\"How glad I am you bought it, father.\"\r\n\r\n\"And of such a tailor! quite a fashionable tailor, a bright blue cloth,\r\nwith bright buttons; it's a deal too good a coat for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too good!\" cried the blind girl, stopping to laugh and clap her\r\nhands--\"as if anything was too good for my handsome father, with his\r\nsmiling face, and black hair, and his straight figure.\"\r\n\r\nCaleb began to sing a rollicking song.\r\n\r\n\"What, you are singing, are you?\" growled a gruff voice, as Mr.\r\nTackleton put his head in at the door. \"_I_ can't afford to sing, I hope\r\nyou can afford to work too. Hardly time for both, I should say.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't see how the master is winking at me,\" whispered Caleb in his\r\ndaughter's ear--\"such a joke, pretending to scold, you know.\"\r\n\r\nThe blind girl laughed and nodded, and taking Mr. Tackleton's reluctant\r\nhand, kissed it gently. \"What is the idiot doing?\" grumbled the Toy\r\nMerchant, pulling his hand roughly away.\r\n\r\n\"I am thanking you for the beautiful little tree,\" replied Bertha,\r\nbringing forward a tiny rose-tree in blossom, which Caleb had made her\r\nbelieve was her master's gift, though he himself had gone without a meal\r\nor two to buy it.\r\n\r\n\"Here's Bedlam broke loose. What does the idiot mean?\" snarled Mr.\r\nTackleton; and giving Caleb some rough orders, he departed without the\r\npoliteness of a farewell.\r\n\r\n\"If you could only have seen him winking at me all the time, pretending\r\nto be so rough to escape thanking,\" exclaimed Caleb, when the door was\r\nshut.\r\n\r\nNow a very sad and curious thing had happened. Caleb, in his love for\r\nBertha, had so successfully deceived her as to the real character of Mr.\r\nTackleton, that she had fallen in love, not with her master, but with\r\nwhat she imagined him to be, and was happy in an innocent belief in his\r\naffection for her; but one day she accidently heard he was going to be\r\nmarried, and could not hide from her father the pain and bewilderment\r\nshe felt at the news.\r\n\r\n\"Bertha, my dear,\" said Caleb at length, \"I have a confession to make to\r\nyou; hear me kindly though I have been cruel to you.\" \"You cruel to me!\"\r\ncried Bertha, turning her sightless face towards him. \"Not meaning it,\r\nmy child! and I never suspected it till the other day. I have concealed\r\nthings from you which would have given pain, I have invented things to\r\nplease you, and have surrounded you with fancies.\"\r\n\r\n\"But living people are not fancies, father, you cannot change them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have done so, my child, God forgive me! Bertha, the man who is\r\nmarried to-day is a hard master to us both, ugly in his looks and in his\r\nnature, and hard and heartless as he can be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh heavens! how blind I have been, how could you father, and I so\r\nhelpless!\" Poor Caleb hung his head.\r\n\r\n\"Answer me father,\" said Bertha. \"What is my home like?\"\r\n\r\n\"A poor place, Bertha, a very poor and bare place! indeed as little able\r\nto keep out wind and weather as my sackcloth coat.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the presents that I took such care of, that came at my wish, and\r\nwere so dearly welcome?\" Caleb did not answer.\r\n\r\n\"I see, I understand,\" said Bertha, \"and now I am looking at you, at my\r\nkind, loving compassionate father, tell me what is he like?\"\r\n\r\n\"An old man, my child, thin, bent, grey-haired, worn-out with hard work\r\nand sorrow, a weak, foolish, deceitful old man.\"\r\n\r\nThe blind girl threw herself on her knees before him, and took his grey\r\nhead in her arms. \"It is my sight, it is my sight restored,\" she cried.\r\n\"I have been blind, but now I see, I have never till now truly seen my\r\nfather. Father, there is not a grey hair on your head that shall be\r\nforgotten in my prayers and thanks to Heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"My Bertha!\" sobbed Caleb, \"and the brisk smart father in the blue\r\ncoat--he's gone, my child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dearest father, no, he's not gone, nothing is gone. I have been happy\r\nand contented, but I shall be happier and more contented still, now that\r\nI know what you are. I am _not_ blind, father, any longer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE NELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe house was one of those receptacles for old and curious things, which\r\nseem to crouch in odd corners of the town; and in the old, dark, murky\r\nrooms, there lived alone together an old man and a child--his\r\ngrandchild, little Nell. Solitary and monotonous as was her life, the\r\ninnocent and cheerful spirit of the child found happiness in all things,\r\nand through the dim rooms of the old curiosity shop little Nell went\r\nsinging, moving with gay and lightsome step.\r\n\r\nBut gradually over the old man, to whom she was so tenderly attached,\r\nthere stole a sad change. He became thoughtful, dejected, and wretched.\r\nHe had no sleep or rest but that which he took by day in his easy chair;\r\nfor every night, and all night long, he was away from home.\r\n\r\nAt last a raging fever seized him, and as he lay delirious or insensible\r\nthrough many weeks, Nell learned that the house which sheltered them was\r\ntheirs no longer; that in the future they would be very poor; that they\r\nwould scarcely have bread to eat.\r\n\r\nAt length the old man began to mend, but his mind was weakened. As the\r\ntime drew near when they must leave the house, he made no reference to\r\nthe necessity of finding other shelter. But a change came upon him one\r\nevening, as he and Nell sat silently together.\r\n\r\n\"Let us speak softly, Nell,\" he said. \"Hush! for if they knew our\r\npurpose they would say that I was mad, and take thee from me. We will\r\nnot stop here another day. We will travel afoot through the fields and\r\nwoods, and trust ourselves to God in the places where He dwells.\"\r\n\r\nThe child's heart beat high with hope and confidence. To her it seemed\r\nthat they might beg their way from door to door in happiness, so that\r\nthey were together.\r\n\r\nWhen the day began to glimmer they stole out of the house, and passing\r\ninto the street stood still.\r\n\r\n\"Which way?\" asked the child.\r\n\r\nThe old man looked irresolutely and helplessly at her, and shook his\r\nhead. It was plain that she was thenceforth his guide and leader. The\r\nchild felt it, but had no doubts or misgivings, and putting her hand in\r\nhis, led him gently away.\r\n\r\nThey passed through the long, deserted streets, until these streets\r\ndwindled away, and the open country was about them. They walked all day,\r\nand slept that night at a small cottage where beds were let to\r\ntravellers. The sun was setting on the second day of their journey,\r\nwhen, following a path which led to the town where they were to spend\r\nthe night, they fell in with two travelling showmen, bound for the races\r\nat a neighboring town.\r\n\r\nThey made two long days' journey with their new companions. The men were\r\nrough and strange in their ways, but they were kindly, too; and in the\r\nbewildering noise and movement of the race-course, where she tried to\r\nsell some little nosegays, Nell would have clung to them for protection,\r\nhad she not learned that these men suspected that she and the old man\r\nhad left their home secretly, and that they meant to take steps to have\r\nthem sent back and taken care of. Separation from her grandfather was\r\nthe greatest evil Nell could dread. She seized her opportunity to evade\r\nthe watchfulness of the two men, and hand in hand she and the old man\r\nfled away together.\r\n\r\nThat night they reached a little village in a woody hollow. The village\r\nschoolmaster, attracted by the child's sweetness and modesty, gave them\r\na lodging for the night; nor would he let them leave him until two days\r\nmore had passed.\r\n\r\nThey journeyed on when the time came that they must wander forth again,\r\nby pleasant country lanes. The afternoon had worn away into a beautiful\r\nevening, when they came to a caravan drawn up by the road. It was a\r\nsmart little house upon wheels, and at the door sat a stout and\r\ncomfortable lady, taking tea. The tea-things were set out upon a drum,\r\ncovered with a white napkin. And there, as if at the most convenient\r\ntable in the world, sat this roving lady, taking her tea and enjoying\r\nthe prospect. Of this stout lady Nell ventured to ask how far it was to\r\nthe neighboring town. And the lady, noticing that the tired child could\r\nhardly repress a tear at hearing that eight weary miles lay still before\r\nthem, not only gave them tea, but offered to take them on in the\r\ncaravan.\r\n\r\nNow this lady of the caravan was the owner of a wax-work show, and her\r\nname was Mrs. Jarley. She offered Nell employment in pointing out the\r\nfigures in the wax-work show to the visitors who came to see it,\r\npromising in return both board and lodging for the child and her\r\ngrandfather, and some small sum of money. This offer Nell was thankful\r\nto accept, and for some time her life and that of the poor, vacant, fond\r\nold man, passed quietly and almost happily.\r\n\r\nOne night Nell and her grandfather went out to walk. A terrible\r\nthunder-storm coming on, they were forced to take refuge in a small\r\npublic-house where men played cards. The old man watched them with\r\nincreasing interest and excitement, until his whole appearance underwent\r\na complete change. His face was flushed and eager, his teeth set. He\r\nseized Nell's little purse, and in spite of her entreaties joined in the\r\ngame, gambling with such a savage thirst for gain that the distressed\r\nand frightened child could almost better have borne to see him dead. The\r\nnight was far advanced before the play came to an end, and they were\r\nforced to remain where they were until the morning. And in the night the\r\nchild was awakened from her troubled sleep to find a figure in the room.\r\nIt was her grandfather himself, his white face pinched and sharpened by\r\nthe greediness which made his eyes unnaturally bright, counting the\r\nmoney of which his hands were robbing her.\r\n\r\nEvening after evening, after that night, the old man would steal away,\r\nnot to return until the night was far spent, demanding, wildly, money.\r\nAnd at last there came an hour when the child overheard him, tempted\r\nbeyond his feeble powers of resistence, undertake to find more money to\r\nfeed the desperate passion which had laid hold upon his weakness by\r\nrobbing Mrs. Jarley.\r\n\r\nThat night the child took her grandfather by the hand and led him forth;\r\nsustained by one idea--that they were flying from disgrace and crime,\r\nand that her grandfather's preservation must depend solely upon her\r\nfirmness; the old man following as though she had been an angel\r\nmessenger sent to lead him where she would.\r\n\r\nThey slept in the open air that night, and on the following morning some\r\nmen offered to take them a long distance on their barge. These men,\r\nthough they were not unkindly, drank and quarrelled among themselves, to\r\nNell's inexpressible terror. It rained, too, heavily, and she was wet\r\nand cold. At last they reached the great city whither the barge was\r\nbound, and here they wandered up and down, being now penniless, and\r\nwatched the faces of those who passed, to find among them a ray of\r\nencouragement or hope.\r\n\r\nThey laid down that night, and the next night too, with nothing between\r\nthem and the sky; a penny loaf was all they had had that day, and when\r\nthe third morning came, it found the child much weaker, yet she made no\r\ncomplaint. Faint and spiritless as they were, the streets were\r\ninsupportable; and the child, throughout the remainder of that hard day,\r\ncompelled herself to press on, that they might reach the country.\r\nEvening was drawing on; they were dragging themselves through the last\r\nstreet. Seeing a traveller on foot before them, she shot on before her\r\ngrandfather and began in a few faint words to implore the stranger's\r\nhelp. He turned his head, the child uttered a wild shriek, and fell\r\nsenseless at his feet. It was the village schoolmaster who had been so\r\nkind to them before.\r\n\r\nThe good man took her in his arms and carried her quickly to a little\r\ninn hard by, where she was tenderly put to bed and where a doctor\r\narrived with all speed. The schoolmaster, as it appeared, was on his way\r\nto a new home. And when the child had recovered somewhat from her\r\nexhaustion, it was arranged that she and her grandfather should\r\naccompany him to the village whither he was bound, and that he should\r\nendeavor to find them some humble occupation by which they could\r\nsubsist.\r\n\r\nIt was a secluded village, lying among the quiet country scenes Nell\r\nloved. And here, her grandfather being tranquil and at rest, a great\r\npeace fell upon the spirit of the child. Often she would steal into the\r\nchurch, and sit down among the quiet figures carved upon the tombs. What\r\nif the spot awakened thoughts of death? It would be no pain to sleep\r\nhere. For the time was drawing nearer every day when Nell was to rest\r\nindeed. She never murmured or complained, but faded like a light upon a\r\nsummer's evening and died. Day after day and all day long, the old man,\r\nbroken-hearted and with no love or care for anything in life, would sit\r\nbeside her grave with her straw hat and the little basket she had been\r\nused to carry, waiting till she should come to him again. At last they\r\nfound him lying dead upon the stone. And in the church where they had\r\noften prayed and mused and lingered, hand in hand, the child and the old\r\nman slept together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE DAVID COPPERFIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle David Copperfield lived with his mother in a pretty house in the\r\nvillage of Blunderstone in Suffolk. His father died before David could\r\nremember anything and he had neither brothers nor sisters. He was fondly\r\nloved by his pretty young mother, and their kind, good servant Peggotty,\r\nand David was a very happy little fellow. They had very few friends, and\r\nthe only relation Mrs. Copperfield talked about was an aunt of David's\r\nfather, a tall and rather terrible old lady, from all accounts. One\r\nvisitor, a tall dark gentleman, David did not like at all, and he was\r\nrather inclined to be jealous that his mother should be friendly with\r\nthe stranger.\r\n\r\nOne day Peggotty, the servant, asked David if he would like to go with\r\nher on a visit to her brother at Yarmouth.\r\n\r\n\"Is your brother an agreeable man, Peggotty?\" he enquired.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what an agreeable man he is!\" cried Peggotty. \"Then there's the\r\nsea, and the boats and ships, and the fishermen, and the beach. And 'Am\r\nto play with.\"\r\n\r\nHam was her nephew. David was quite anxious to go when he heard of all\r\nthese delights; but his mother, what would she do all alone? Peggotty\r\ntold him his mother was going to pay a visit to some friends, and would\r\nbe sure to let him go. So all was arranged, and they were to start the\r\nnext day in the carrier's cart. When they arrived at Yarmouth, they\r\nfound Ham waiting to meet them. He was a great strong fellow, six feet\r\nhigh, and took David on his back and the box under his arm to carry both\r\nto the house. David was delighted to find that this house was made of a\r\nreal big black boat, with a door and windows cut in the side, and an\r\niron funnel sticking out of the roof for a chimney. Inside, it was very\r\ncosy and clean, and David had a tiny bedroom in the stern. He was very\r\nmuch pleased to find a dear little girl, about his own age, to play\r\nwith, and soon discovered that she and Ham were orphans, children of Mr.\r\nPeggotty's brother and sister, whose fathers had been drowned at sea, so\r\nkind Mr. Peggotty had taken them to live with him. David was very happy\r\nin this queer house, playing on the beach with Em'ly, as they called the\r\nlittle girl, and told her all about his happy home; and she told him how\r\nher father had been drowned at sea before she came to live with her\r\nuncle. David said he thought Mr. Peggotty must be a very good man.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" said Em'ly. \"If ever I was to be a lady, I'd give him a sky-blue\r\ncoat with diamond buttons, nankeen trousers, a red velvet waistcoat, a\r\ncocked hat, a large gold watch, a silver pipe, and a box of money!\"\r\n\r\nDavid was quite sorry to leave these kind people and his dear little\r\ncompanion, but still he was glad to think he should get back to his own\r\ndear mamma. When he reached home, however, he found a great change. His\r\nmother was married to the dark man David did not like, whose name was\r\nMr. Murdstone, and he was a stern, hard man, who had no love for little\r\nDavid, and did not allow his mother to pet and indulge him as she had\r\ndone before. Mr. Murdstone's sister came to live with them, and as she\r\nwas even more difficult to please than her brother, and disliked boys,\r\nDavid's life was no longer a happy one. He had always had lessons with\r\nhis mother, and as she was patient and gentle, he had enjoyed learning\r\nto read, but now he had a great many very hard lessons to do, and was so\r\nfrightened and shy when Mr. and Miss Murdstone were in the room, that he\r\ndid not get on at all well, and was continually in disgrace. His only\r\npleasure was to go up into the little room at the top of the house\r\nwhere he had found a number of books that had belonged to his own\r\nfather, and he would sit and read Robinson Crusoe, and many tales of\r\ntravels and adventures.\r\n\r\nBut one day he got into sad trouble over his lessons, and Mr. Murdstone\r\nwas very angry, and took him away from his mother and beat him with a\r\ncane. David had never been beaten in his life before, and was so\r\nmaddened by pain and rage that he bit Mr. Murdstone's hand! Now, indeed,\r\nhe had done something to deserve the punishment, and Mr. Murdstone in a\r\nfury, beat him savagely, and left him sobbing and crying on the floor.\r\nDavid was kept locked up in his room for some days, seeing no one but\r\nMiss Murdstone, who brought him his food. At last, one night, he heard\r\nhis name whispered at the key hole.\r\n\r\n\"Is that you, Peggotty?\" he asked, groping his way to the door.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my precious Davy. Be as soft as a mouse or the cat will hear us.\"\r\n\r\nDavid understood she meant Miss Murdstone, whose room was quite near.\r\n\"How's mamma, Peggotty dear? Is she very angry with me?\" he whispered.\r\n\r\n\"No--not very,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"What is going to be done with me, dear Peggotty, do you know?\" asked\r\npoor David, who had been wondering all these long, lonely days.\r\n\r\n\"School--near London--\"\r\n\r\n\"When, Peggotty?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow,\" answered Peggotty.\r\n\r\n\"Shan't I see mamma?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--morning,\" she said, and went on to promise David she would always\r\nlove him, and take the greatest care of his dear mamma, and write him\r\nevery week.\r\n\r\nThe next morning David saw his mother, very pale and with red eyes. He\r\nran to her arms and begged her to forgive him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Davy,\" she said, \"that you should hurt anyone I love! I forgive\r\nyou, Davy, but it grieves me so that you should have such bad passions\r\nin your heart. Try to be better, pray to be better.\"\r\n\r\nDavid was very unhappy that his mother should think him so wicked, and\r\nthough she kissed him, and said, \"I forgive you, my dear boy, God bless\r\nyou,\" he cried so bitterly when he was on his way in the carrier's\r\ncart, that his pocket handkerchief had to be spread out on the horse's\r\nback to dry.\r\n\r\nAfter they had gone a little way the cart stopped, and Peggotty came\r\nrunning up, with a parcel of cakes and a purse for David. After giving\r\nhim a good hug, she ran off.\r\n\r\nDavy found three bright shillings in the purse, and two half-crowns\r\nwrapped in paper on which was written, in his mother's hand--\"For Davy.\r\nWith my love.\"\r\n\r\nDavy shared his cakes with the carrier, who asked if Peggotty made them,\r\nand David told him yes, she did all their cooking. The carrier looked\r\nthoughtful, and then asked David if he would send a message to Peggotty\r\nfrom him. David agreed, and the message was \"Barkis is willing.\" While\r\nDavid was waiting for the coach at Yarmouth, he wrote to Peggotty:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR PEGGOTTY,--I have come here safe. Barkis is willing. My love to\r\nmamma.--Yours affectionately.\"\r\n\r\n\"_P. S._--He says he particularly wanted you to know _Barkis is\r\nwilling_.\"\r\n\r\nAt Yarmouth he found dinner was ordered for him, and felt very shy at\r\nhaving a table all to himself, and very much alarmed when the waiter\r\ntold him he had seen a gentleman fall down dead, after drinking some of\r\ntheir beer. David said he would have some water, and was quite grateful\r\nto the waiter for drinking the ale that had been ordered for him, for\r\nfear the people of the hotel should be offended. He also helped David to\r\neat his dinner and accepted one of his bright shillings.\r\n\r\nWhen they got to Salem House, as the School was called, David found that\r\nhe had been sent before the holidays were over as a punishment, and was\r\nalso to wear a placard on his back, on which was written--\"Take care of\r\nhim. He bites.\" This made David miserable, and he dreaded the return of\r\nthe boys.\r\n\r\nSome of the boys teased David by pretending he was a dog, calling him\r\nTowser, and patting and stroking him; but, on the whole, it was not so\r\nbad as David had expected. The head boy, Steerforth, promised to take\r\ncare of him, and David loved him dearly, and thought him a great hero.\r\nSteerforth took a great fancy to the pretty bright-eyed little fellow,\r\nand David became a favorite with all the boys, by telling them all he\r\ncould remember of the tales he had read.\r\n\r\nOne day David had a visit from Mr. Peggotty and Ham, who had brought two\r\nenormous lobsters, a huge crab, and a large canvas bag of shrimps, as\r\nthey \"remembered he was partial to a relish with his meals.\"\r\n\r\nDavid was proud to introduce his friend Steerforth to these kind simple\r\nfriends, and told them how good Steerforth was to him, and the \"relish\"\r\nwas much appreciated by the boys at supper that night.\r\n\r\nWhen he got home for the holidays David found he had a little baby\r\nbrother, and his mother and Peggotty were very much pleased to see him\r\nagain. Mr. and Miss Murdstone were out, and David sat with his mother\r\nand Peggotty, and told them all about his school and Steerforth, and\r\ntook the little baby in his arms and nursed it lovingly. But when the\r\nMurdstones came back they showed plainly they disliked him, and thought\r\nhim in the way, and scolded him, and would not allow him to touch the\r\nbaby, or even to sit with Peggotty in the kitchen, so he was not sorry\r\nwhen the time came for him to go back to school, except for leaving his\r\ndear mamma and the baby.\r\n\r\nAbout two months after he had been back at school he was sent for one\r\nday and told that his dear mamma had died! The wife of the head-master\r\nwas very kind and gentle to the desolate little boy, and the boys were\r\nvery sorry for him.\r\n\r\nDavid went home the next day, and heard that the dear baby had died too.\r\nPeggotty received him with great tenderness, and told him about his\r\nmother's illness and how she had sent a loving message.\r\n\r\n\"Tell my dearest boy that his mother, as she lay here, blessed him not\r\nonce, but a thousand times,\" and she had prayed to God to protect and\r\nkeep her fatherless boy.\r\n\r\nMr. Murdstone did not take any notice of poor little David, nor had Miss\r\nMurdstone a word of kindness for the orphan. Peggotty was to leave in a\r\nmonth, and, to their great joy, David was allowed to go with her on a\r\nvisit to Mr. Peggotty. On their way David found out that the mysterious\r\nmessage he had given to Peggotty meant that Barkis wanted to marry her,\r\nand Peggotty had consented. Everyone in Mr. Peggotty's cottage was\r\npleased to see David, and did their best to comfort him. Little Em'ly\r\nwas at school when he arrived, and he went out to meet her, but when he\r\nsaw her coming along, her blue eyes bluer, and her bright face prettier\r\nthan ever, he pretended not to know her, and was passing by, when Em'ly\r\nlaughed and ran away, so of course he was obliged to run and catch her\r\nand try to kiss her, but she would not let him, saying she was not a\r\nbaby now. But she was kind to him all the same, and when they spoke\r\nabout the loss of his dear mother, David saw that her eyes were full of\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nDuring this visit Peggotty was married to Mr. Barkis, and had a nice\r\nlittle house of her own, and Davy spent the night before he was to\r\nreturn home in a little room in the roof.\r\n\r\n\"Young or old, Davy dear, so long as I have this house over my head,\"\r\nsaid Peggotty, \"you shall find it as if I expected you here directly\r\nevery minute. I shall keep it as I used to keep your old little room, my\r\ndarling, and if you was to go to China, you might think of its being\r\nkept just the same all the time you were away.\"\r\n\r\nDavid felt how good and true a friend she was, and thanked her as well\r\nas he could, for they had brought him to the gate of his home, and\r\nPeggotty had him clasped in her arms.\r\n\r\nHow utterly wretched and forlorn he felt! He found he was not to go back\r\nto school any more, and wandered about sad and solitary, neglected and\r\nuncared for. Peggotty's weekly visits were his only comfort. No one took\r\nany pains with him, and he had no friends near who could help him.\r\n\r\nAt last one day, after some weary months had passed, Mr. Murdstone told\r\nhim he was to go to London and earn his own living. There was a place\r\nfor him at Murdstone & Grinby's, a firm in the wine trade. His lodging\r\nand clothes would be provided for him by his step-father, and he would\r\nearn enough for his food and pocket money. The next day David was sent\r\nup to London with the manager, dressed in a shabby little white hat with\r\nblack crape round it for his mother, a black jacket, and hard, stiff\r\ncorduroy trousers, a little fellow of ten years old to fight his own\r\nbattles in the world!\r\n\r\nHis place, he found, was one of the lowest, with boys of no education\r\nand in quite an inferior station to himself--his duties were to wash\r\nbottles, stick on labels, and so on. David was utterly miserable at\r\nbeing degraded in this way, and shed bitter tears, as he feared he would\r\nforget all he had learnt at school. His lodging, one bare little room,\r\nwas in the house of some people named Micawber, shiftless, careless,\r\ngood-natured people, who were always in debt and difficulties. David\r\nfelt great pity for their misfortunes and did what he could to help poor\r\nMrs. Micawber to sell her books and other little things she could spare,\r\nto buy food for herself, her husband, and their four children. If he had\r\nnot been a very innocent-minded, good little boy, he might easily have\r\nfallen into bad ways at this time. But God took care of the orphan boy\r\nand kept him from harm.\r\n\r\nThe troubles of the Micawbers increased more and more, until at last\r\nthey were obliged to leave London. The last Sunday the Micawbers were in\r\ntown David dined with them. After he had seen them off the next morning\r\nby the coach, he wrote to Peggotty to ask her if she knew where his\r\naunt, Miss Betsy Trotwood, lived, and to borrow half a guinea; for he\r\nhad resolved to run away from Murdstone & Grinby's, and go to his aunt\r\nand tell her his story. Peggotty wrote, enclosing the half-guinea, and\r\nsaying she only knew Miss Trotwood lived near Dover, but whether in that\r\nplace itself, or at Folkestone, Sandgate, or Hythe, she could not tell.\r\nHearing that all these places were close together, David made up his\r\nmind to start. As he had received his week's wages in advance, he waited\r\ntill the following Saturday, thinking it would not be honest to go\r\nbefore. He went out to look for some one to carry his box to the coach\r\noffice, and unfortunately employed a wicked young man who not only ran\r\noff with his box, but robbed him of his half-guinea, leaving poor David\r\nin dire distress. In despair, he started off to walk to Dover, and was\r\nforced to sell his waistcoat to buy some bread. The first night he found\r\nhis way to his old school at Blackheath, and slept on a haystack close\r\nby, feeling some comfort in the thought of the boys being near. He knew\r\nSteerforth had left, or he would have tried to see him.\r\n\r\nOn he trudged the next day and sold his jacket for one shilling and\r\nfourpence. He was afraid to buy anything but bread or to spend any money\r\non a bed or a shelter for the night. After six days, he arrived at\r\nDover, ragged, dusty, and half-dead with hunger and fatigue. But here,\r\nat first, he could get no tidings of his aunt, and, in despair, was\r\ngoing to try some of the other places Peggotty had mentioned, when the\r\ndriver of a fly dropped his horsecloth, and as David was handing it up\r\nto him, he saw something kind in the man's face that encouraged him to\r\nask once more if he knew where Miss Trotwood lived.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LITTLE DAVID COPPERFIELD.]\r\n\r\nThe man directed him towards some houses on the heights, and thither\r\nDavid toiled; a forlorn little creature, without a jacket or waistcoat,\r\nhis white hat crushed out of shape, his shoes worn out, his shirt and\r\ntrousers torn and stained, his pretty curly hair tangled, his face and\r\nhands sunburnt, and covered with dust. Lifting his big, wistful eyes to\r\none of the windows above, he saw a pleasant faced gentleman with grey\r\nhair, who nodded at him several times, then shook his head and went\r\naway. David was just turning away to think what he should do, when a\r\ntall, erect, elderly lady, with a gardening apron on and a knife in her\r\nhand, came out of the house, and began to dig up a root in the garden.\r\n\r\n\"Go away,\" she cried. \"Go away. No boys here.\"\r\n\r\nBut David felt desperate. Going in softly, he stood beside her, and\r\ntouched her with his finger, and said timidly, \"If you please, ma'am--\"\r\nand when she looked up, he went on--\r\n\r\n\"Please, aunt, I am your nephew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Lord!\" she exclaimed in astonishment, and sat flat down on the\r\npath, staring at him, while he went on--\r\n\r\n\"I am David Copperfield, of Blunderstone, in Suffolk, where you came the\r\nnight I was born, and saw my dear mamma. I have been unhappy since she\r\ndied. I have been slighted and taught nothing, and thrown upon myself,\r\nand put to work not fit for me. It made me run away to you. I was robbed\r\nat first starting out and have walked all the way, and have never slept\r\nin a bed since I began the journey.\" Here he broke into a passion of\r\ncrying, and his aunt jumped up and took him into the house, where she\r\nput him on the sofa and sent the servant to ask \"Mr. Dick\" to come down.\r\nThe gentleman whom David had seen at the window came in and was told who\r\nthe ragged little object on the sofa was.\r\n\r\n\"Now here you see young David Copperfield, and the question is What\r\nshall I do with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do with him?\" answered Mr. Dick. Then, after some consideration, and\r\nlooking at David, he said, \"Well, if I was you, I would wash him!\"\r\n\r\nDavid knelt down to say his prayers that night in a pleasant room facing\r\nthe sea, and as he lay in the clean, snow-white bed, he prayed he might\r\nnever be homeless again, and might never forget the homeless.\r\n\r\nThe next morning his aunt told him she had written to Mr. Murdstone, and\r\nat last Mr. and Miss Murdstone arrived.\r\n\r\nMr. Murdstone told Miss Betsy that David was a very bad, stubborn,\r\nviolent-tempered boy, whom he had tried to improve, but could not\r\nsucceed. If Miss Trotwood chose to protect and encourage him now, she\r\nmust do it always, for he had come to fetch him away.\r\n\r\n\"Are you ready to go, David?\" asked his aunt.\r\n\r\nBut David answered no, and begged and prayed her for his father's sake\r\nto befriend and protect him, for neither Mr. nor Miss Murdstone had ever\r\nliked him or been kind to him.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dick,\" said Miss Trotwood, \"what shall I do with this child?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dick considered. \"Have him measured for a suit of clothes directly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dick,\" said Miss Trotwood, \"your common sense is invaluable.\"\r\n\r\nThen she pulled David towards her, and said to Mr. Murdstone, \"You can\r\ngo when you like. I'll take my chance with the boy. If he's all you say\r\nhe is I can at least do as much for him as you have done. But I don't\r\nbelieve a word of it.\"\r\n\r\nSome clothes were bought for him that same day and marked \"Trotwood\r\nCopperfield,\" for his aunt wished to call him by her name.\r\n\r\nNow David felt his troubles were over, and he began quite a new life,\r\nwell cared for and kindly treated. He was sent to a very nice school in\r\nCanterbury, where his aunt left him with these words, which David never\r\nforgot.\r\n\r\n\"Trot, be a credit to yourself, to me, and Mr. Dick, and Heaven be with\r\nyou. Never be mean in anything, never be false, never be cruel. Avoid\r\nthese three vices, Trot, and I shall always be hopeful of you.\"\r\n\r\nDavid did his best to show his gratitude to his dear aunt by studying\r\nhard, and trying to be all she could wish.\r\n\r\nWhen you are older you can read how he grew up to be a good, clever man,\r\nand met again all his old friends, and made many new ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJENNY WREN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, a great many years ago, a gentleman ran up the steps of a tall\r\nhouse in the neighborhood of St. Mary Axe.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman knocked and rang several times before any one came, but at\r\nlast an old man opened the door. \"What were you up to that you did not\r\nhear me?\" said Mr. Fledgeby irritably.\r\n\r\n\"I was taking the air at the top of the house, sir,\" said the old man\r\nmeekly, \"it being a holiday. What might you please to want, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph! Holiday indeed,\" grumbled his master, who was a toy merchant\r\namongst other things. He then seated himself and gave the old man--a Jew\r\nand Riah by name--directions about the dressing of some dolls, and, as\r\nhe rose to go, exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"By the bye, how _do_ you take the air? Do you stick your head out of a\r\nchimney-pot?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I have made a little garden on the roof.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's look at it,\" said Mr. Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I have company there,\" returned Riah hesitating, \"but will you\r\nplease come up and see them?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fledgeby nodded, and the old man led the way up flight after flight\r\nof stairs, till they arrived at the house-top. Seated on a carpet, and\r\nleaning against a chimney-stack, were two girls bending over books. Some\r\ncreepers were trained round the chimney-pots, and evergreens were placed\r\nround the roof, and a few more books, a basket of gaily colored scraps,\r\nand bits of tinsel, lay near. One of the girls rose on seeing that Riah\r\nhad brought a visitor, but the other remarked, \"I'm the person of the\r\nhouse downstairs, but I can't get up, whoever you are, because my back\r\nis bad, and my legs are queer.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is my master,\" said Riah speaking to the two girls, \"and this,\" he\r\nadded, turning to Mr. Fledgeby, \"is Miss Jenny Wren; she lives in this\r\nhouse, and is a clever little dressmaker for little people. Her friend\r\nLizzie,\" continued Riah, introducing the second girl. \"They are good\r\ngirls, both, and as busy as they are good; in spare moments they come up\r\nhere, and take to book learning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" said Mr. Fledgeby, looking round, \"Humph!\" He was so much\r\nsurprised that apparently he couldn't get beyond that word.\r\n\r\nLizzie, the elder of these two girls, was strong and handsome, but the\r\nlittle Jenny Wren, whom she so loved and protected, was small, and\r\ndeformed, though she had a beautiful little face, and the longest and\r\nloveliest golden hair in the world, which fell about her like a cloak of\r\nshining curls, as though to hide the poor little misshapen figure.\r\n\r\nThe Jew Riah, as well as Lizzie, was always kind and gentle to Jenny\r\nWren, who called him godfather. She had a father, who shared her poor\r\nlittle rooms, whom she called her child, for he was a bad, drunken,\r\ndisreputable old man, and the poor girl had to care for him, and earn\r\nmoney to keep them both. Sometimes the two girls, Jenny helping herself\r\nalong with a crutch, would go and walk about the fashionable streets. As\r\nthey walked along, Jenny would tell her friend of the fancies she had\r\nwhen sitting alone at her work. \"I imagine birds till I can hear them\r\nsing,\" she said one day, \"and flowers till I can smell them. And oh! the\r\nbeautiful children that come to me, in the early mornings! They are\r\nquite different to other children, not like me, never cold, or anxious,\r\nor tired, or hungry, never any pain; they come in numbers, in long\r\nbright slanting rows, all dressed in white, with shiny heads. 'Who is\r\nthis in pain?' they say, and they sweep around and about me, take me up\r\nin their arms, and I feel so light, and all the pain goes. I know they\r\nare coming a long way off, by hearing them say, 'Who is this in pain?'\r\nand I answer, 'Oh my blessed children, it's poor me! have pity on me,\r\nand take me up and then the pain will go.'\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: JENNIE WREN.\r\n  \"THE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN THAT COME TO ME.\"]\r\n\r\nLizzie sat stroking and brushing the beautiful hair, when they were at\r\nhome again, and as she kissed her good-night, a miserable old man\r\nstumbled into the room. \"How's my Jenny Wren, best of children?\" he\r\nmumbled, as he shuffled unsteadily towards her, but Jenny pointed her\r\nsmall finger towards him exclaiming--\"Go along with you, you bad,\r\nwicked, old child, you troublesome, wicked, old thing, _I_ know where\r\nyou have been; ain't you ashamed of yourself, you disgraceful boy?\"\r\n\"Yes; my dear, yes,\" stammered the tipsy old father, tumbling into a\r\ncorner. One day when Jenny was on her way home with Riah, they came on a\r\nsmall crowd of people. A tipsy man had been knocked down and badly\r\nhurt--\"Let us see what it is!\" said Jennie. The next moment she\r\nexclaimed--\"Oh, gentlemen--gentlemen, he is my child, he belongs to me,\r\nmy poor, bad, old child!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your child--belongs to you--\" repeated the man who was about to lift\r\nthe helpless figure on to a stretcher. \"Aye, it's old Dolls--tipsy old\r\nDolls--\" cried some one in the crowd, for it was by this name that they\r\nknew the old man.\r\n\r\n\"He's her father, sir,\" said Riah in a low tone to the doctor who was\r\nnow bending over the stretcher.\r\n\r\n\"So much the worse,\" answered the doctor, \"for the man is dead.\"\r\n\r\nYes, \"Mr. Dolls\" was dead, and many were the dresses which the weary\r\nfingers of the sorrowful little worker must make in order to pay for his\r\nhumble funeral, and buy a black frock for herself. Often the tears\r\nrolled down on to her work. \"My poor child,\" she said to Riah, \"my poor\r\nold child, and to think I scolded him so.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were always a good, brave, patient girl,\" returned Riah, \"always\r\ngood and patient, however tired.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so the poor little \"person of the house\" was left alone but for the\r\nfaithful affection of the kind Jew, and her friend Lizzie. Her room grew\r\npretty comfortable, for she was in great request in her \"profession\" as\r\nshe called it, and there was now no one to spend and waste her earnings.\r\nBut nothing could make her life otherwise than a suffering one till the\r\nhappy morning, when her child-angels visited her for the last time and\r\ncarried her away to the land where all such pain as hers is healed for\r\nevermore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIP'S ADVENTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that little Philip Pirrip, usually called Pip, knew about his father\r\nand mother, and five little brothers, was from seeing their tombstones\r\nin the churchyard. He was taken care of by his sister, who was twenty\r\nyears older than himself. She had married a blacksmith, named Joe\r\nGargery, a kind, good man, while she, unfortunately, was a hard, stern\r\nwoman, and treated her little brother and her amiable husband with great\r\nharshness. They lived in a marshy part of the country, about twenty\r\nmiles from the sea.\r\n\r\nOne cold raw day towards evening, when Pip was about six years old, he\r\nwandered into the churchyard, and trying to make out what he could of\r\nthe inscriptions on his family tombstones, and the darkness coming on,\r\nhe felt very lonely and frightened, and began to cry.\r\n\r\n\"Hold your noise!\" cried a terrible voice, and a man started up from\r\namong the graves close to him. \"Keep still, you little imp, or I'll cut\r\nyour throat!\"\r\n\r\nHe was a dreadful looking man, dressed in coarse grey cloth, with a\r\ngreat iron on his leg. Wet, muddy and miserable, his teeth chattered in\r\nhis head, as he seized Pip by the chin.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! don't cut my throat, sir,\" cried Pip, in terror.\r\n\r\n\"Tell us your name!\" said the man. \"Quick!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pip, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Once more,\" said the man, staring at him. \"Give it mouth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pip. Pip, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Show us where you live,\" said the man. \"Point out the place.\"\r\n\r\nPip showed him the village, about a mile or more from the church.\r\n\r\nThe man looked at him for a moment, and then turned him upside down and\r\nemptied his pockets. He found nothing in them but a piece of bread,\r\nwhich he ate ravenously.\r\n\r\n\"Now lookee here,\" said the man. \"Where's your mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"There, sir,\" said Pip.\r\n\r\nAt this the man started to run away, but stopped and looked over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"There, sir,\" explained Pip, showing him the tombstone.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, and is that your father along of your mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Pip.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" muttered the man, \"then who d'ye live with--supposin' you're\r\nkindly let to live, which I han't made up my mind about?\"\r\n\r\n\"My sister, sir, Mrs. Joe Gargery, wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blacksmith, eh?\" said the man, and looked down at his leg. Then he\r\nseized the trembling little boy by both arms, and glaring down at him,\r\nhe said,--\r\n\r\n\"Now lookee here, the question being whether you're to be let to\r\nlive--You know what a file is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you know what wittles is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You get me a file, and you get me wittles--you bring 'em both to me.\"\r\nAll this time he was tilting poor Pip backwards till he was dreadfully\r\nfrightened and giddy.\r\n\r\n\"You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles--You\r\ndo it, and you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign\r\nconcerning your having seen such a person as me, or any person sumever,\r\nand you shall be let to live.\" Then he let him go, saying--\"You remember\r\nwhat you've undertook, and you get home.\"\r\n\r\nPip ran home without stopping. Joe was sitting in the chimney corner,\r\nand told him Mrs. Joe had been out to look for him, and taken Tickler\r\nwith her. Tickler was a cane, and Pip was rather depressed by this piece\r\nof news.\r\n\r\nMrs. Joe came in almost directly, and after having given Pip a taste of\r\nTickler, she sat down to prepare the tea, and cutting a huge slice of\r\nbread and butter, she gave half of it to Joe and half to Pip. Pip\r\nmanaged, after some time, to slip his down the leg of his trousers, and\r\nJoe, thinking he had swallowed it, was dreadfully alarmed and begged him\r\nnot to bolt his food like that. \"Pip, old chap, you'll do yourself a\r\nmischief,--it'll stick somewhere, you can't have chewed it, Pip. You\r\nknow, Pip, you and me is always friends, and I'd be the last to tell\r\nupon you at any time, but such a--such a most uncommon bolt as that.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PIP AND THE CONVICT.\r\n  HALF DEAD WITH COLD AND HUNGER.]\r\n\r\n\"Been bolting his food, has he?\" cried Mrs. Joe.\r\n\r\n\"You know, old chap,\" said Joe, \"I bolted myself when I was your\r\nage--frequent--and as a boy I've been among many bolters; but I never\r\nsee your bolting equal yet, Pip, and it's a mercy you ain't bolted\r\ndead.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Pip passed a wretched night, thinking of the dreadful promise he\r\nhad made, and as soon as it was beginning to get light outside he got up\r\nand crept downstairs.\r\n\r\nAs quickly as he could he took some bread, some cheese, about half a jar\r\nof mince-meat he tied up in a handkerchief, with the slice of bread and\r\nbutter, some brandy from a stone bottle, a meat bone with very little on\r\nit, and a pork pie, which he found on an upper shelf. Then he got a file\r\nfrom among Joe's tools, and ran for the marshes.\r\n\r\nPip found the man waiting for him, half dead with cold and hunger, and\r\nhe ate the food in such a ravenous way that Pip, in spite of his terror,\r\nwas quite pitiful over him, and said, \"I am glad you enjoy it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thankee, my boy, I do.\"\r\n\r\nPip watched him trying to file the iron off his leg, and then, being\r\nafraid of stopping longer away from home, he ran off.\r\n\r\nPip passed a wretched morning expecting every moment that the\r\ndisappearance of the pie would be found out. But Mrs. Joe was too much\r\ntaken up with preparing the dinner, for they were expecting visitors.\r\n\r\nJust at the end of the dinner Pip thought his time had come to be found\r\nout, for his sister said graciously to her guests--\r\n\r\n\"You must taste a most delightful and delicious present I have had. It's\r\na pie, a savory pork pie.\"\r\n\r\nPip could bear it no longer, and ran for the door, and there ran head\r\nforemost into a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held\r\nout a pair of handcuffs to him saying--\"Here you are, look sharp, come\r\non.\" But they had not come for him, they only wanted Joe to mend the\r\nhandcuffs, for they were on the search for two convicts who had escaped\r\nand were somewhere hid in the marshes. This turned the attention of Mrs.\r\nJoe from the disappearance of the pie without which she had come back,\r\nin great astonishment. When the handcuffs were mended the soldiers went\r\noff, accompanied by Joe and one of the visitors, and Joe took Pip and\r\ncarried him on his back.\r\n\r\nPip whispered, \"I hope, Joe, we shan't find them,\" and Joe answered \"I'd\r\ngive a shilling if they had cut and run, Pip.\"\r\n\r\nBut the soldiers soon caught them, and one was Pip's miserable\r\nacquaintance, and once when the man looked at Pip, the child shook his\r\nhead to try and let him know he had said nothing.\r\n\r\nBut the convict, without looking at anyone, told the Sergeant he wanted\r\nto say something to prevent other people being under suspicion, and said\r\nhe had taken some \"wittles\" from the blacksmith's. \"It was some broken\r\nwittles, that's what it was, and a dram of liquor, and a pie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?\"\r\nenquired the Sergeant.\r\n\r\n\"My wife did, at the very moment when you came in.\"\r\n\r\n\"So,\" said the convict, looking at Joe, \"you're the blacksmith, are you?\r\nThen I'm sorry to say, I've eat your pie.\"\r\n\r\n\"God knows you're welcome to it,\" said Joe. \"We don't know what you have\r\ndone, but we wouldn't have you starved to death for it, poor miserable\r\nfellow creature. Would us, Pip?\"\r\n\r\nThen the boat came, and the convicts were taken back to prison, and Joe\r\ncarried Pip home.\r\n\r\nSome years after, some mysterious friend sent money for Pip to be\r\neducated and brought up as a gentleman, but it was only when Pip was\r\nquite grown up that he discovered this mysterious friend was the\r\nwretched convict who had frightened him so dreadfully that cold, dark\r\nChristmas Eve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Text in italics is indicated with underscores: _italics_.\r\n\r\n  Inconsistencies in spelling and hyphenation have been retained from\r\n    the original.\r\n\r\n  Punctuation has been corrected without note.\r\n\r\n  Obvious typographical errors have been corrected as follows:\r\n    Page  7: Fren changed to Fern\r\n    Page 25: Joe changed to Jo\r\n    Page 31: DORRITT changed to DORRIT\r\n    Page 34: needlwork changed to needlework\r\n    Page 40: distresed changed to distressed\r\n    Page 41: grandfaather changed to grandfather\r\n    Page 56: hugh changed to huge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Charles Dickens' Children Stories, by \r\nCharles Dickens\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CHARLES DICKENS' CHILDREN STORIES ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 37121.txt or 37121.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/3/7/1/2/37121/\r\n\r\nProduced by Juliet Sutherland, David E.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n",

IT SHINES UPON HIS GRAVE                15\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHILD\u2019S DREAM OF A STAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a child, and he strolled about a good deal, and thought\r\nof a number of things. He had a sister, who was a child too, and his\r\nconstant companion. These two used to wonder all day long. They\r\nwondered at the beauty of the flowers; they wondered at the height and\r\nblueness of the sky; they wondered at the depth of the bright water;\r\nthey wondered at the goodness and the power of GOD, who made the\r\nlovely world.\r\n\r\nThey used to say to one another, sometimes, Supposing all the children\r\nupon earth were to die, would the flowers and the water and the sky be\r\nsorry? They believed they would be sorry. For, said they, the buds are\r\nthe children of the flowers, and the little playful streams that\r\ngambol down the hillsides are the children of the water; and the\r\nsmallest bright specks playing at hide-and-seek in the sky all night\r\nmust surely be the children of the stars; and they would all be\r\ngrieved to see their playmates, the children of men, no more.\r\n\r\nThere was one clear shining star that used to come out in the sky\r\nbefore the rest, near the church-spire, above the graves. It was\r\nlarger and more beautiful, they thought, than all the others, and\r\nevery night they watched for it, standing hand in hand at a window.\r\nWhoever saw it first cried out, \u201cI see the star!\u201d And often they cried\r\nout both together, knowing so well when it would rise and where. So\r\nthey grew to be such friends with it, that, before lying down in their\r\nbeds, they always looked out once again, to bid it good night; and\r\nwhen they were turning round to sleep, they used to say, \u201cGod bless\r\nthe star!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut while she was still very young, O, very, very young, the sister\r\ndrooped, and came to be so weak that she could no longer stand in the\r\nwindow at night; and then the child looked sadly out by himself,\r\nand when he saw the star, turned round and said to the patient pale\r\nface on the bed, \u201cI see the star!\u201d And then a smile would come upon\r\nthe face, and a little weak voice used to say, \u201cGod bless my brother\r\nand the star!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd so the time came, all too soon! when the child looked out alone,\r\nand when there was no face on the bed; and when there was a little\r\ngrave among the graves, not there before; and when the star made long\r\nrays down towards him, as he saw it through his tears.\r\n\r\nNow, these rays were so bright, and they seemed to make such a shining\r\nway from earth to heaven, that when the child went to his solitary\r\nbed, he dreamed about the star; and dreamed that, lying where he\r\nwas, he saw a train of people taken up that sparkling road by angels.\r\nAnd the star, opening, showed him a great world of light, where many\r\nmore such angels waited to receive them.\r\n\r\nAll these angels, who were waiting, turned their beaming eyes upon the\r\npeople who were carried up into the star; and some came out from the\r\nlong rows in which they stood, and fell upon the people\u2019s necks, and\r\nkissed them tenderly, and went away with them down avenues of light,\r\nand were so happy in their company, that, lying in his bed, he wept\r\nfor joy.\r\n\r\nBut there were many angels who did not go with them, and among them\r\none he knew. The patient face that once had lain upon the bed was\r\nglorified and radiant, but his heart found out his sister among all\r\nthe host.\r\n\r\nHis sister\u2019s angel lingered near the entrance of the star, and said to\r\nthe leader among those who had brought the people thither, \u201cIs my\r\nbrother come?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was turning hopefully away, when the child stretched out his arms,\r\nand cried, \u201cO sister, I am here! Take me!\u201d And then she turned her\r\nbeaming eyes upon him, and it was night; and the star was shining into\r\nthe room, making long rays down towards him as he saw it through his\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nFrom that hour forth, the child looked out upon the star as on the\r\nhome he was to go to, when his time should come; and he thought that\r\nhe did not belong to the earth alone, but to the star too, because of\r\nhis sister\u2019s angel gone before.\r\n\r\nThere was a baby born to be a brother to the child; and while he was\r\nso little that he never yet had spoken word, he stretched his tiny\r\nform out on his bed, and died.\r\n\r\nAgain the child dreamed of the opened star, and of the company of\r\nangels, and the train of people, and the rows of angels with their\r\nbeaming eyes all turned upon those people\u2019s faces.\r\n\r\nSaid his sister\u2019s angel to the leader, \u201cIs my brother come?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \u201cNot that one, but another.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the child beheld his brother\u2019s angel in her arms, he cried, \u201cO\r\nsister, I am here! Take me!\u201d And she turned and smiled upon him, and\r\nthe star was shining.\r\n\r\nHe grew to be a young man, and was busy at his books when an old\r\nservant came to him and said, \u201cThy mother is no more. I bring her\r\nblessing on her darling son!\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain at night he saw the star, and all that former company. Said his\r\nsister\u2019s angel to the leader, \u201cIs my brother come?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \u201cThy mother!\u201d\r\n\r\nA mighty cry of joy went forth through all the star, because the\r\nmother was reunited to her two children. And he stretched out his arms\r\nand cried, \u201cO mother, sister, and brother, I am here! Take me!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd they answered him, \u201cNot yet.\u201d And the star was shining.\r\n\r\nHe grew to be a man, whose hair was turning gray; and he was sitting\r\nin his chair by the fireside, heavy with grief, and with his face\r\nbedewed with tears, when the star opened once again.\r\n\r\nSaid his sister\u2019s angel to the leader, \u201cIs my brother come?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \u201cNay, but his maiden daughter.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd the man who had been the child saw his daughter, newly lost to\r\nhim, a celestial creature among those three, and he said, \u201cMy\r\ndaughter\u2019s head is on my sister\u2019s bosom, and her arm is round my\r\nmother\u2019s neck, and at her feet there is the baby of old time, and I\r\ncan bear the parting from her, GOD be praised!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd the star was shining.\r\n\r\nThus the child came to be an old man, and his once smooth face was\r\nwrinkled, and his steps were slow and feeble, and his back was bent.\r\nAnd one night as he lay upon his bed, his children standing round, he\r\ncried, as he had cried so long ago, \u201cI see the star!\u201d\r\n\r\nThey whispered one another, \u201cHe is dying.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \u201cI am. My age is falling from me like a garment, and I\r\nmove towards the star as a child. And O my Father, now I thank\r\nthee that it has so often opened to receive those dear ones who await\r\nme!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd the star was shining; and it shines upon his grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's A Child's Dream of a Star, by Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A CHILD'S DREAM OF A STAR ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 42232-0.txt or 42232-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/2/2/3/42232/\r\n\r\nProduced by Greg Bergquist, Matthew Wheaton and the Online\r\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This\r\nfile was produced from images generously made available\r\nby The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

They are transcribed from the microfilm\r\nof the notebooks belonging to Lord Abinger which is in the library of\r\nDuke University.\r\n\r\nThe text follows Mary Shelley's manuscript exactly except for the\r\nomission of mere corrections by the author, most of which are\r\nnegligible; those that are significant are included and explained in\r\nthe notes. Footnotes indicated by an asterisk are Mrs. Shelley's own\r\nnotes. She was in general a fairly good speller, but certain words,\r\nespecially those in which there was a question of doubling or not\r\ndoubling a letter, gave her trouble: untill (though occasionally she\r\ndeleted the final _l_ or wrote the word correctly), agreable, occured,\r\nconfering, buble, meaness, receeded, as well as hopless, lonly,\r\nseperate, extactic, sacrifise, desart, and words ending in -ance or\r\n-ence. These and other mispellings (even those of proper names) are\r\nreproduced without change or comment. The use of _sic_ and of square\r\nbrackets is reserved to indicate evident slips of the pen, obviously\r\nincorrect, unclear, or incomplete phrasing and punctuation, and my\r\nconjectures in emending them.\r\n\r\nI am very grateful to the library of Duke University and to its\r\nlibrarian, Dr. Benjamin E. Powell, not only for permission to\r\ntranscribe and publish this work by Mary Shelley but also for the many\r\ncourtesies shown to me when they welcomed me as a visiting scholar in\r\n1956. To Lord Abinger also my thanks are due for adding his approval\r\nof my undertaking, and to the Curators of the Bodleian Library for\r\npermiting me to use and to quote from the papers in the reserved\r\nShelley Collection. Other libraries and individuals helped me while I\r\nwas editing _Mathilda_: the Enoch Pratt Free Library of Baltimore,\r\nwhose Literature and Reference Departments went to endless trouble for\r\nme; the Julia Rogers Library of Goucher College and its staff; the\r\nlibrary of the University of Pennsylvania; Miss R. Glynn Grylls (Lady\r\nMander); Professor Lewis Patton of Duke University; Professor\r\nFrederick L. Jones of the University of Pennsylvania; and many other\r\npersons who did me favors that seemed to them small but that to me\r\nwere very great.\r\n\r\nI owe much also to previous books by and about the Shelleys.

It\r\nexists in both rough draft and final copy. In this story, as in all\r\nMary Shelley's writing, there is much that is autobiographical: it\r\nwould be hard to find a more self-revealing work. For an understanding\r\nof Mary's character, especially as she saw herself, and of her\r\nattitude toward Shelley and toward Godwin in 1819, this tale is an\r\nimportant document. Although the main narrative, that of the father's\r\nincestuous love for his daughter, his suicide, and Mathilda's\r\nconsequent withdrawal from society to a lonely heath, is not in any\r\nreal sense autobiographical, many elements in it are drawn from\r\nreality. The three main characters are clearly Mary herself, Godwin,\r\nand Shelley, and their relations can easily be reassorted to\r\ncorrespond with actuality.\r\n\r\nHighly personal as the story was, Mary Shelley hoped that it would be\r\npublished, evidently believing that the characters and the situations\r\nwere sufficiently disguised. In May of 1820 she sent it to England by\r\nher friends, the Gisbornes, with a request that her father would\r\narrange for its publication. But _Mathilda_, together with its rough\r\ndraft entitled _The Fields of Fancy_, remained unpublished among the\r\nShelley papers. Although Mary's references to it in her letters and\r\njournal aroused some curiosity among scholars, it also remained\r\nunexamined until comparatively recently.\r\n\r\nThis seeming neglect was due partly to the circumstances attending the\r\ndistribution of the family papers after the deaths of Sir Percy and\r\nLady Shelley. One part of them went to the Bodleian Library to become\r\na reserved collection which, by the terms of Lady Shelley's will, was\r\nopened to scholars only under definite restrictions. Another part went\r\nto Lady Shelley's niece and, in turn, to her heirs, who for a time did\r\nnot make the manuscripts available for study. A third part went to Sir\r\nJohn Shelley-Rolls, the poet's grand-nephew, who released much\r\nimportant Shelley material, but not all the scattered manuscripts. In\r\nthis division, the two notebooks containing the finished draft of\r\n_Mathilda_ and a portion of _The Fields of Fancy_ went to Lord\r\nAbinger, the notebook containing the remainder of the rough draft to\r\nthe Bodleian Library, and some loose sheets containing additions and\r\nrevisions to Sir John Shelley-Rolls. Happily all the manuscripts are\r\nnow accessible to scholars, and it is possible to publish the full\r\ntext of _Mathilda_ with such additions from _The Fields of Fancy_ as\r\nare significant.[ii]\r\n\r\nThe three notebooks are alike in format.[iii] One of Lord Abinger's\r\nnotebooks contains the first part of _The Fields of Fancy_, Chapter 1\r\nthrough the beginning of Chapter 10, 116 pages. The concluding portion\r\noccupies the first fifty-four pages of the Bodleian notebook. There is\r\nthen a blank page, followed by three and a half pages, scored out, of\r\nwhat seems to be a variant of the end of Chapter 1 and the beginning\r\nof Chapter 2. A revised and expanded version of the first part of\r\nMathilda's narrative follows (Chapter 2 and the beginning of Chapter\r\n3), with a break between the account of her girlhood in Scotland and\r\nthe brief description of her father after his return. Finally there\r\nare four pages of a new opening, which was used in _Mathilda_. This is\r\nan extremely rough draft: punctuation is largely confined to the dash,\r\nand there are many corrections and alterations. The Shelley-Rolls\r\nfragments, twenty-five sheets or slips of paper, usually represent\r\nadditions to or revisions of _The Fields of Fancy_: many of them are\r\nnumbered, and some are keyed into the manuscript in Lord Abinger's\r\nnotebook. Most of the changes were incorporated in _Mathilda_.\r\n\r\nThe second Abinger notebook contains the complete and final draft of\r\n_Mathilda_, 226 pages. It is for the most part a fair copy. The text\r\nis punctuated and there are relatively few corrections, most of them,\r\napparently the result of a final rereading, made to avoid the\r\nrepetition of words. A few additions are written in the margins. On\r\nseveral pages slips of paper containing evident revisions (quite\r\npossibly originally among the Shelley-Rolls fragments) have been\r\npasted over the corresponding lines of the text. An occasional passage\r\nis scored out and some words and phrases are crossed out to make way\r\nfor a revision. Following page 216, four sheets containing the\r\nconclusion of the story are cut out of the notebook. They appear, the\r\npages numbered 217 to 223, among the Shelley-Rolls fragments. A\r\nrevised version, pages 217 to 226, follows the cut.[iv]\r\n\r\nThe mode of telling the story in the final draft differs radically\r\nfrom that in the rough draft. In _The Fields of Fancy_ Mathilda's\r\nhistory is set in a fanciful framework. The author is transported by\r\nthe fairy Fantasia to the Elysian Fields, where she listens to the\r\ndiscourse of Diotima and meets Mathilda. Mathilda tells her story,\r\nwhich closes with her death. In the final draft this unrealistic and\r\nlargely irrelevant framework is discarded: Mathilda, whose death is\r\napproaching, writes out for her friend Woodville the full details of\r\nher tragic history which she had never had the courage to tell him in\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nThe title of the rough draft, _The Fields of Fancy_, and the setting\r\nand framework undoubtedly stem from Mary Wollstonecraft's unfinished\r\ntale, _The Cave of Fancy_, in which one of the souls confined in the\r\ncenter of the earth to purify themselves from the dross of their\r\nearthly existence tells to Sagesta (who may be compared with Diotima)\r\nthe story of her ill-fated love for a man whom she hopes to rejoin\r\nafter her purgation is completed.[v] Mary was completely familiar with\r\nher mother's works. This title was, of course, abandoned when the\r\nframework was abandoned, and the name of the heroine was substituted.\r\nThough it is worth noticing that Mary chose a name with the same\r\ninitial letter as her own, it was probably taken from Dante. There are\r\nseveral references in the story to the cantos of the _Purgatorio_ in\r\nwhich Mathilda appears. Mathilda's father is never named, nor is\r\nMathilda's surname given. The name of the poet went through several\r\nchanges: Welford, Lovel, Herbert, and finally Woodville.\r\n\r\nThe evidence for dating _Mathilda_ in the late summer and autumn of\r\n1819 comes partly from the manuscript, partly from Mary's journal. On\r\nthe pages succeeding the portions of _The Fields of Fancy_ in the\r\nBodleian notebook are some of Shelley's drafts of verse and prose,\r\nincluding parts of _Prometheus Unbound_ and of _Epipsychidion_, both\r\nin Italian, and of the preface to the latter in English, some prose\r\nfragments, and extended portions of the _Defence of Poetry_. Written\r\nfrom the other end of the book are the _Ode to Naples_ and _The Witch\r\nof Atlas_. Since these all belong to the years 1819, 1820, and 1821,\r\nit is probable that Mary finished her rough draft some time in 1819,\r\nand that when she had copied her story, Shelley took over the\r\nnotebook. Chapter 1 of _Mathilda_ in Lord Abinger's notebook is\r\nheaded, \"Florence Nov. 9th. 1819.\" Since the whole of Mathilda's story\r\ntakes place in England and Scotland, the date must be that of the\r\nmanuscript. Mary was in Florence at that time.\r\n\r\nThese dates are supported by entries in Mary's journal which indicate\r\nthat she began writing _Mathilda_, early in August, while the Shelleys\r\nwere living in the Villa Valosano, near Leghorn. On August 4, 1819,\r\nafter a gap of two months from the time of her little son's death, she\r\nresumed her diary. Almost every day thereafter for a month she\r\nrecorded, \"Write,\" and by September 4, she was saying, \"Copy.\" On\r\nSeptember 12 she wrote, \"Finish copying my Tale.\" The next entry to\r\nindicate literary activity is the one word, \"write,\" on November 8. On\r\nthe 12th Percy Florence was born, and Mary did no more writing until\r\nMarch, when she was working on _Valperga_. It is probable, therefore,\r\nthat Mary wrote and copied _Mathilda_ between August 5 and September\r\n12, 1819, that she did some revision on November 8 and finally dated\r\nthe manuscript November 9.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent history of the manuscript is recorded in letters and\r\njournals. When the Gisbornes went to England on May 2, 1820, they took\r\n_Mathilda_ with them; they read it on the journey and recorded their\r\nadmiration of it in their journal.[vi] They were to show it to Godwin\r\nand get his advice about publishing it. Although Medwin heard about\r\nthe story when he was with the Shelleys in 1820[vii] and Mary read\r\nit--perhaps from the rough draft--to Edward and Jane Williams in the\r\nsummer of 1821,[viii] this manuscript apparently stayed in Godwin's\r\nhands. He evidently did not share the Gisbornes' enthusiasm: his\r\napproval was qualified. He thought highly of certain parts of it, less\r\nhighly of others; and he regarded the subject as \"disgusting and\r\ndetestable,\" saying that the story would need a preface to prevent\r\nreaders \"from being tormented by the apprehension ... of the fall of\r\nthe heroine,\"--that is, if it was ever published.[ix] There is,\r\nhowever, no record of his having made any attempt to get it into\r\nprint. From January 18 through June 2, 1822, Mary repeatedly asked\r\nMrs. Gisborne to retrieve the manuscript and have it copied for her,\r\nand Mrs. Gisborne invariably reported her failure to do so. The last\r\nreferences to the story are after Shelley's death in an unpublished\r\njournal entry and two of Mary's letters. In her journal for October\r\n27, 1822, she told of the solace for her misery she had once found in\r\nwriting _Mathilda_. In one letter to Mrs. Gisborne she compared the\r\njourney of herself and Jane to Pisa and Leghorn to get news of Shelley\r\nand Williams to that of Mathilda in search of her father,\r\n\"driving--(like Matilda), towards the _sea_ to learn if we were to be\r\nfor ever doomed to misery.\"[x] And on May 6, 1823, she wrote, \"Matilda\r\nforetells even many small circumstances most truly--and the whole of\r\nit is a monument of what now is.\"[xi]\r\n\r\nThese facts not only date the manuscript but also show Mary's feeling\r\nof personal involvement in the story. In the events of 1818-1819 it is\r\npossible to find the basis for this morbid tale and consequently to\r\nassess its biographical significance.\r\n\r\nOn September 24, 1818, the Shelleys' daughter, Clara Everina, barely a\r\nyear old, died at Venice. Mary and her children had gone from Bagni di\r\nLucca to Este to join Shelley at Byron's villa. Clara was not well\r\nwhen they started, and she grew worse on the journey. From Este\r\nShelley and Mary took her to Venice to consult a physician, a trip\r\nwhich was beset with delays and difficulties. She died almost as soon\r\nas they arrived. According to Newman Ivey White,[xii] Mary, in the\r\nunreasoning agony of her grief, blamed Shelley for the child's death\r\nand for a time felt toward him an extreme physical antagonism which\r\nsubsided into apathy and spiritual alienation. Mary's black moods made\r\nher difficult to live with, and Shelley himself fell into deep\r\ndejection. He expressed his sense of their estrangement in some of the\r\nlyrics of 1818--\"all my saddest poems.\" In one fragment of verse, for\r\nexample, he lamented that Mary had left him \"in this dreary world\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\n    Thy form is here indeed--a lovely one--\r\n    But thou art fled, gone down the dreary road,\r\n    That leads to Sorrow's most obscure abode.\r\n    Thou sittest on the hearth of pale despair,\r\n                                         Where\r\n    For thine own sake I cannot follow thee.\r\n\r\nProfessor White believed that Shelley recorded this estrangement only\r\n\"in veiled terms\" in _Julian and Maddalo_ or in poems that he did not\r\nshow to Mary, and that Mary acknowledged it only after Shelley's\r\ndeath, in her poem \"The Choice\" and in her editorial notes on his\r\npoems of that year. But this unpublished story, written after the\r\ndeath of their other child William, certainly contains, though also in\r\nveiled terms, Mary's immediate recognition and remorse. Mary well\r\nknew, I believe, what she was doing to Shelley. In an effort to purge\r\nher own emotions and to acknowledge her fault, she poured out on the\r\npages of _Mathilda_ the suffering and the loneliness, the bitterness\r\nand the self-recrimination of the past months.\r\n\r\nThe biographical elements are clear: Mathilda is certainly Mary\r\nherself; Mathilda's father is Godwin; Woodville is an idealized\r\nShelley.\r\n\r\nLike Mathilda Mary was a woman of strong passions and affections which\r\nshe often hid from the world under a placid appearance. Like\r\nMathilda's, Mary's mother had died a few days after giving her birth.\r\nLike Mathilda she spent part of her girlhood in Scotland. Like\r\nMathilda she met and loved a poet of \"exceeding beauty,\" and--also\r\nlike Mathilda--in that sad year she had treated him ill, having become\r\n\"captious and unreasonable\" in her sorrow. Mathilda's loneliness,\r\ngrief, and remorse can be paralleled in Mary's later journal and in\r\n\"The Choice.\" This story was the outlet for her emotions in 1819.\r\n\r\nWoodville, the poet, is virtually perfect, \"glorious from his youth,\"\r\nlike \"an angel with winged feet\"--all beauty, all goodness, all\r\ngentleness. He is also successful as a poet, his poem written at the\r\nage of twenty-three having been universally acclaimed. Making\r\nallowance for Mary's exaggeration and wishful thinking, we easily\r\nrecognize Shelley: Woodville has his poetic ideals, the charm of his\r\nconversation, his high moral qualities, his sense of dedication and\r\nresponsibility to those he loved and to all humanity. He is Mary's\r\nearliest portrait of her husband, drawn in a year when she was slowly\r\nreturning to him from \"the hearth of pale despair.\"\r\n\r\nThe early circumstances and education of Godwin and of Mathilda's\r\nfather were different. But they produced similar men, each\r\nextravagant, generous, vain, dogmatic. There is more of Godwin in this\r\ntale than the account of a great man ruined by character and\r\ncircumstance. The relationship between father and daughter, before it\r\nwas destroyed by the father's unnatural passion, is like that between\r\nGodwin and Mary. She herself called her love for him \"excessive and\r\nromantic.\"[xiii] She may well have been recording, in Mathilda's\r\nsorrow over her alienation from her father and her loss of him by\r\ndeath, her own grief at a spiritual separation from Godwin through\r\nwhat could only seem to her his cruel lack of sympathy. He had accused\r\nher of being cowardly and insincere in her grief over Clara's\r\ndeath[xiv] and later he belittled her loss of William.[xv] He had also\r\ncalled Shelley \"a disgraceful and flagrant person\" because of\r\nShelley's refusal to send him more money.[xvi] No wonder if Mary felt\r\nthat, like Mathilda, she had lost a beloved but cruel father.\r\n\r\nThus Mary took all the blame for the rift with Shelley upon herself\r\nand transferred the physical alienation to the break in sympathy with\r\nGodwin. That she turned these facts into a story of incest is\r\nundoubtedly due to the interest which she and Shelley felt in the\r\nsubject at this time. They regarded it as a dramatic and effective\r\ntheme. In August of 1819 Shelley completed _The Cenci_. During its\r\nprogress he had talked over with Mary the arrangement of scenes; he\r\nhad even suggested at the outset that she write the tragedy herself.\r\nAnd about a year earlier he had been urging upon her a translation of\r\nAlfieri's _Myrrha_. Thomas Medwin, indeed, thought that the story\r\nwhich she was writing in 1819 was specifically based on _Myrrha_. That\r\nshe was thinking of that tragedy while writing _Mathilda_ is evident\r\nfrom her effective use of it at one of the crises in the tale. And\r\nperhaps she was remembering her own handling of the theme when she\r\nwrote the biographical sketch of Alfieri for Lardner's _Cabinet\r\nCyclopaedia_ nearly twenty years later. She then spoke of the\r\ndifficulties inherent in such a subject, \"inequality of age adding to\r\nthe unnatural incest. To shed any interest over such an attachment,\r\nthe dramatist ought to adorn the father with such youthful attributes\r\nas would be by no means contrary to probability.\"[xvii] This she\r\nendeavored to do in _Mathilda_ (aided indeed by the fact that the\r\nsituation was the reverse of that in _Myrrha_). Mathilda's father was\r\nyoung: he married before he was twenty. When he returned to Mathilda,\r\nhe still showed \"the ardour and freshness of feeling incident to\r\nyouth.\" He lived in the past and saw his dead wife reincarnated in his\r\ndaughter. Thus Mary attempts to validate the situation and make it \"by\r\nno means contrary to probability.\"\r\n\r\n_Mathilda_ offers a good example of Mary Shelley's methods of\r\nrevision. A study of the manuscript shows that she was a careful\r\nworkman, and that in polishing this bizarre story she strove\r\nconsistently for greater credibility and realism, more dramatic (if\r\nsometimes melodramatic) presentation of events, better motivation,\r\nconciseness, and exclusion of purple passages. In the revision and\r\nrewriting, many additions were made, so that _Mathilda_ is appreciably\r\nlonger than _The Fields of Fancy_. But the additions are usually\r\nimprovements: a much fuller account of Mathilda's father and mother\r\nand of their marriage, which makes of them something more than lay\r\nfigures and to a great extent explains the tragedy; development of the\r\ncharacter of the Steward, at first merely the servant who accompanies\r\nMathilda in her search for her father, into the sympathetic confidant\r\nwhose responses help to dramatise the situation; an added word or\r\nshort phrase that marks Mary Shelley's penetration into the motives\r\nand actions of both Mathilda and her father. Therefore _Mathilda_ does\r\nnot impress the reader as being longer than _The Fields of Fancy_\r\nbecause it better sustains his interest. And with all the additions\r\nthere are also effective omissions of the obvious, of the\r\ntautological, of the artificially elaborate.[xviii]\r\n\r\nThe finished draft, _Mathilda_, still shows Mary Shelley's faults as a\r\nwriter: verbosity, loose plotting, somewhat stereotyped and\r\nextravagant characterization. The reader must be tolerant of its\r\nheroine's overwhelming lamentations. But she is, after all, in the\r\ngreat tradition of romantic heroines: she compares her own weeping to\r\nthat of Boccaccio's Ghismonda over the heart of Guiscardo. If the\r\nreader can accept Mathilda on her own terms, he will find not only\r\nbiographical interest in her story but also intrinsic merits: a\r\nfeeling for character and situation and phrasing that is often\r\nvigorous and precise.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n[i] They are listed in Nitchie, _Mary Shelley_, Appendix II, pp.\r\n205-208.

I\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorence. Nov. 9th 1819\r\n\r\nIt is only four o'clock; but it is winter and the sun has already set:\r\nthere are no clouds in the clear, frosty sky to reflect its slant\r\nbeams, but the air itself is tinged with a slight roseate colour which\r\nis again reflected on the snow that covers the ground. I live in a\r\nlone cottage on a solitary, wide heath: no voice of life reaches me. I\r\nsee the desolate plain covered with white, save a few black patches\r\nthat the noonday sun has made at the top of those sharp pointed\r\nhillocks from which the snow, sliding as it fell, lay thinner than on\r\nthe plain ground: a few birds are pecking at the hard ice that covers\r\nthe pools--for the frost has been of long continuance.[2]\r\n\r\nI am in a strange state of mind.[3] I am alone--quite alone--in the\r\nworld--the blight of misfortune has passed over me and withered me; I\r\nknow that I am about to die and I feel happy--joyous.--I feel my\r\npulse; it beats fast: I place my thin hand on my cheek; it burns:\r\nthere is a slight, quick spirit within me which is now emitting its\r\nlast sparks. I shall never see the snows of another winter--I do\r\nbelieve that I shall never again feel the vivifying warmth of another\r\nsummer sun; and it is in this persuasion that I begin to write my\r\ntragic history. Perhaps a history such as mine had better die with me,\r\nbut a feeling that I cannot define leads me on and I am too weak both\r\nin body and mind to resist the slightest impulse. While life was\r\nstrong within me I thought indeed that there was a sacred horror in my\r\ntale that rendered it unfit for utterance, and now about to die I\r\npollute its mystic terrors. It is as the wood of the Eumenides none\r\nbut the dying may enter; and Oedipus is about to die.[4]\r\n\r\nWhat am I writing?--I must collect my thoughts. I do not know that any\r\nwill peruse these pages except you, my friend, who will receive them\r\nat my death. I do not address them to you alone because it will give\r\nme pleasure to dwell upon our friendship in a way that would be\r\nneedless if you alone read what I shall write. I shall relate my tale\r\ntherefore as if I wrote for strangers. You have often asked me the\r\ncause of my solitary life; my tears; and above all of my impenetrable\r\nand unkind silence. In life I dared not; in death I unveil the\r\nmystery. Others will toss these pages lightly over: to you, Woodville,\r\nkind, affectionate friend, they will be dear--the precious memorials\r\nof a heart-broken girl who, dying, is still warmed by gratitude\r\ntowards you:[5] your tears will fall on the words that record my\r\nmisfortunes; I know they will--and while I have life I thank you for\r\nyour sympathy.\r\n\r\nBut enough of this. I will begin my tale: it is my last task, and I\r\nhope I have strength sufficient to fulfill it. I record no crimes; my\r\nfaults may easily be pardoned; for they proceeded not from evil motive\r\nbut from want of judgement; and I believe few would say that they\r\ncould, by a different conduct and superior wisdom, have avoided the\r\nmisfortunes to which I am the victim. My fate has been governed by\r\nnecessity, a hideous necessity. It required hands stronger than mine;\r\nstronger I do believe than any human force to break the thick,\r\nadamantine chain that has bound me, once breathing nothing but joy,\r\never possessed by a warm love & delight in goodness,--to misery only\r\nto be ended, and now about to be ended, in death. But I forget myself,\r\nmy tale is yet untold. I will pause a few moments, wipe my dim eyes,\r\nand endeavour to lose the present obscure but heavy feeling of\r\nunhappiness in the more acute emotions of the past.[6]\r\n\r\nI was born in England. My father was a man of rank:[7] he had lost his\r\nfather early, and was educated by a weak mother with all the\r\nindulgence she thought due to a nobleman of wealth. He was sent to\r\nEton and afterwards to college; & allowed from childhood the free use\r\nof large sums of money; thus enjoying from his earliest youth the\r\nindependance which a boy with these advantages, always acquires at a\r\npublic school.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of these circumstances his passions found a deep\r\nsoil wherein they might strike their roots and flourish either as\r\nflowers or weeds as was their nature. By being always allowed to act\r\nfor himself his character became strongly and early marked and\r\nexhibited a various surface on which a quick sighted observer might\r\nsee the seeds of virtues and of misfortunes. His careless\r\nextravagance, which made him squander immense sums of money to satisfy\r\npassing whims, which from their apparent energy he dignified with the\r\nname of passions, often displayed itself in unbounded generosity. Yet\r\nwhile he earnestly occupied himself about the wants of others his own\r\ndesires were gratified to their fullest extent. He gave his money, but\r\nnone of his own wishes were sacrifised to his gifts; he gave his time,\r\nwhich he did not value, and his affections which he was happy in any\r\nmanner to have called into action.\r\n\r\nI do not say that if his own desires had been put in competition with\r\nthose of others that he would have displayed undue selfishness, but\r\nthis trial was never made. He was nurtured in prosperity and attended\r\nby all its advantages; every one loved him and wished to gratify him.\r\nHe was ever employed in promoting the pleasures of his companions--but\r\ntheir pleasures were his; and if he bestowed more attention upon the\r\nfeelings of others than is usual with schoolboys it was because his\r\nsocial temper could never enjoy itself if every brow was not as free\r\nfrom care as his own.\r\n\r\nWhile at school, emulation and his own natural abilities made him hold\r\na conspicuous rank in the forms among his equals; at college he\r\ndiscarded books; he believed that he had other lessons to learn than\r\nthose which they could teach him. He was now to enter into life and he\r\nwas still young enough to consider study as a school-boy shackle,\r\nemployed merely to keep the unruly out of mischief but as having no\r\nreal connexion with life--whose wisdom of riding--gaming &c. he\r\nconsidered with far deeper interest--So he quickly entered into all\r\ncollege follies although his heart was too well moulded to be\r\ncontaminated by them--it might be light but it was never cold. He was\r\na sincere and sympathizing friend--but he had met with none who\r\nsuperior or equal to himself could aid him in unfolding his mind, or\r\nmake him seek for fresh stores of thought by exhausting the old ones.\r\nHe felt himself superior in quickness of judgement to those around\r\nhim: his talents, his rank and wealth made him the chief of his party,\r\nand in that station he rested not only contented but glorying,\r\nconceiving it to be the only ambition worthy for him to aim at in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nBy a strange narrowness of ideas he viewed all the world in connexion\r\nonly as it was or was not related to his little society. He considered\r\nqueer and out of fashion all opinions that were exploded by his circle\r\nof intimates, and he became at the same time dogmatic and yet fearful\r\nof not coinciding with the only sentiments he could consider orthodox.\r\nTo the generality of spectators he appeared careless of censure, and\r\nwith high disdain to throw aside all dependance on public prejudices;\r\nbut at the same time that he strode with a triumphant stride over the\r\nrest of the world, he cowered, with self disguised lowliness, to his\r\nown party, and although its [chi]ef never dared express an opinion or\r\na feeling until he was assured that it would meet with the approbation\r\nof his companions.\r\n\r\nYet he had one secret hidden from these dear friends; a secret he had\r\nnurtured from his earliest years, and although he loved his fellow\r\ncollegiates he would not trust it to the delicacy or sympathy of any\r\none among them. He loved. He feared that the intensity of his passion\r\nmight become the subject of their ridicule; and he could not bear that\r\nthey should blaspheme it by considering that trivial and transitory\r\nwhich he felt was the life of his life.\r\n\r\nThere was a gentleman of small fortune who lived near his family\r\nmansion who had three lovely daughters. The eldest was far the most\r\nbeautiful, but her beauty was only an addition to her other\r\nqualities--her understanding was clear & strong and her disposition\r\nangelically gentle. She and my father had been playmates from infancy:\r\nDiana, even in her childhood had been a favourite with his mother;\r\nthis partiality encreased with the years of this beautiful and lively\r\ngirl and thus during his school & college vacations[8] they were\r\nperpetually together. Novels and all the various methods by which\r\nyouth in civilized life are led to a knowledge of the existence of\r\npassions before they really feel them, had produced a strong effect on\r\nhim who was so peculiarly susceptible of every impression. At eleven\r\nyears of age Diana was his favourite playmate but he already talked\r\nthe language of love. Although she was elder than he by nearly two\r\nyears the nature of her education made her more childish at least in\r\nthe knowledge and expression of feeling; she received his warm\r\nprotestations with innocence, and returned them unknowing of what they\r\nmeant. She had read no novels and associated only with her younger\r\nsisters, what could she know of the difference between love and\r\nfriendship? And when the development of her understanding disclosed\r\nthe true nature of this intercourse to her, her affections were\r\nalready engaged to her friend, and all she feared was lest other\r\nattractions and fickleness might make him break his infant vows.\r\n\r\nBut they became every day more ardent and tender. It was a passion\r\nthat had grown with his growth; it had become entwined with every\r\nfaculty and every sentiment and only to be lost with life. None knew\r\nof their love except their own two hearts; yet although in all things\r\nelse, and even in this he dreaded the censure of his companions, for\r\nthus truly loving one inferior to him in fortune, nothing was ever\r\nable for a moment to shake his purpose of uniting himself to her as\r\nsoon as he could muster courage sufficient to meet those difficulties\r\nhe was determined to surmount.\r\n\r\nDiana was fully worthy of his deepest affection. There were few who\r\ncould boast of so pure a heart, and so much real humbleness of soul\r\njoined to a firm reliance on her own integrity and a belief in that of\r\nothers. She had from her birth lived a retired life. She had lost her\r\nmother when very young, but her father had devoted himself to the care\r\nof her education--He had many peculiar ideas which influenced the\r\nsystem he had adopted with regard to her--She was well acquainted with\r\nthe heroes of Greece and Rome or with those of England who had lived\r\nsome hundred years ago, while she was nearly ignorant of the passing\r\nevents of the day: she had read few authors who had written during at\r\nleast the last fifty years but her reading with this exception was\r\nvery extensive. Thus although she appeared to be less initiated in the\r\nmysteries of life and society than he her knowledge was of a deeper\r\nkind and laid on firmer foundations; and if even her beauty and\r\nsweetness had not fascinated him her understanding would ever have\r\nheld his in thrall. He looked up to her as his guide, and such was his\r\nadoration that he delighted to augment to his own mind the sense of\r\ninferiority with which she sometimes impressed him.[9]\r\n\r\nWhen he was nineteen his mother died. He left college on this event\r\nand shaking off for a while his old friends he retired to the\r\nneighbourhood of his Diana and received all his consolation from her\r\nsweet voice and dearer caresses. This short seperation from his\r\ncompanions gave him courage to assert his independance. He had a\r\nfeeling that however they might express ridicule of his intended\r\nmarriage they would not dare display it when it had taken place;\r\ntherefore seeking the consent of his guardian which with some\r\ndifficulty he obtained, and of the father of his mistress which was\r\nmore easily given, without acquainting any one else of his intention,\r\nby the time he had attained his twentieth birthday he had become the\r\nhusband of Diana.\r\n\r\nHe loved her with passion and her tenderness had a charm for him that\r\nwould not permit him to think of aught but her. He invited some of his\r\ncollege friends to see him but their frivolity disgusted him. Diana\r\nhad torn the veil which had before kept him in his boyhood: he was\r\nbecome a man and he was surprised how he could ever have joined in the\r\ncant words and ideas of his fellow collegiates or how for a moment he\r\nhad feared the censure of such as these. He discarded his old\r\nfriendships not from fickleness but because they were indeed unworthy\r\nof him. Diana filled up all his heart: he felt as if by his union with\r\nher he had received a new and better soul. She was his monitress as he\r\nlearned what were the true ends of life. It was through her beloved\r\nlessons that he cast off his old pursuits and gradually formed himself\r\nto become one among his fellow men; a distinguished member of society,\r\na Patriot; and an enlightened lover of truth and virtue.--He loved her\r\nfor her beauty and for her amiable disposition but he seemed to love\r\nher more for what he considered her superior wisdom. They studied,\r\nthey rode together; they were never seperate and seldom admitted a\r\nthird to their society.\r\n\r\nThus my father, born in affluence, and always prosperous, clombe\r\nwithout the difficulty and various disappointments that all human\r\nbeings seem destined to encounter, to the very topmost pinacle of\r\nhappiness: Around him was sunshine, and clouds whose shapes of beauty\r\nmade the prospect divine concealed from him the barren reality which\r\nlay hidden below them. From this dizzy point he was dashed at once as\r\nhe unawares congratulated himself on his felicity. Fifteen months\r\nafter their marriage I was born, and my mother died a few days after\r\nmy birth.\r\n\r\nA sister of my father was with him at this period. She was nearly\r\nfifteen years older than he, and was the offspring of a former\r\nmarriage of his father. When the latter died this sister was taken by\r\nher maternal relations: they had seldom seen one another, and were\r\nquite unlike in disposition. This aunt, to whose care I was afterwards\r\nconsigned, has often related to me the effect that this catastrophe\r\nhad on my father's strong and susceptible character. From the moment\r\nof my mother's death untill his departure she never heard him utter a\r\nsingle word: buried in the deepest melancholy he took no notice of any\r\none; often for hours his eyes streamed tears or a more fearful gloom\r\noverpowered him. All outward things seemed to have lost their\r\nexistence relatively to him and only one circumstance could in any\r\ndegree recall him from his motionless and mute despair: he would never\r\nsee me. He seemed insensible to the presence of any one else, but if,\r\nas a trial to awaken his sensibility, my aunt brought me into the room\r\nhe would instantly rush out with every symptom of fury and\r\ndistraction. At the end of a month he suddenly quitted his house and,\r\nunatteneded [_sic_] by any servant, departed from that part of the\r\ncountry without by word or writing informing any one of his\r\nintentions. My aunt was only relieved of her anxiety concerning his\r\nfate by a letter from him dated Hamburgh.\r\n\r\nHow often have I wept over that letter which untill I was sixteen was\r\nthe only relick I had to remind me of my parents. \"Pardon me,\" it\r\nsaid, \"for the uneasiness I have unavoidably given you: but while in\r\nthat unhappy island, where every thing breathes _her_ spirit whom I\r\nhave lost for ever, a spell held me. It is broken: I have quitted\r\nEngland for many years, perhaps for ever. But to convince you that\r\nselfish feeling does not entirely engross me I shall remain in this\r\ntown untill you have made by letter every arrangement that you judge\r\nnecessary. When I leave this place do not expect to hear from me: I\r\nmust break all ties that at present exist. I shall become a wanderer,\r\na miserable outcast--alone! alone!\"--In another part of the letter he\r\nmentioned me--\"As for that unhappy little being whom I could not see,\r\nand hardly dare mention, I leave her under your protection. Take care\r\nof her and cherish her: one day I may claim her at your hands; but\r\nfuturity is dark, make the present happy to her.\"\r\n\r\nMy father remained three months at Hamburgh; when he quitted it he\r\nchanged his name, my aunt could never discover that which he adopted\r\nand only by faint hints, could conjecture that he had taken the road\r\nof Germany and Hungary to Turkey.[10]\r\n\r\nThus this towering spirit who had excited interest and high\r\nexpectation in all who knew and could value him became at once, as it\r\nwere, extinct. He existed from this moment for himself only. His\r\nfriends remembered him as a brilliant vision which would never again\r\nreturn to them. The memory of what he had been faded away as years\r\npassed; and he who before had been as a part of themselves and of\r\ntheir hopes was now no longer counted among the living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nI now come to my own story. During the early part of my life there is\r\nlittle to relate, and I will be brief; but I must be allowed to dwell\r\na little on the years of my childhood that it may be apparent how when\r\none hope failed all life was to be a blank; and how when the only\r\naffection I was permitted to cherish was blasted my existence was\r\nextinguished with it.\r\n\r\nI have said that my aunt was very unlike my father. I believe that\r\nwithout the slightest tinge of a bad heart she had the coldest that\r\never filled a human breast: it was totally incapable of any affection.\r\nShe took me under her protection because she considered it her duty;\r\nbut she had too long lived alone and undisturbed by the noise and\r\nprattle of children to allow that I should disturb her quiet. She had\r\nnever been married; and for the last five years had lived perfectly\r\nalone on an estate, that had descended to her through her mother, on\r\nthe shores of Loch Lomond in Scotland. My father had expressed a wish\r\nin his letters that she should reside with me at his family mansion\r\nwhich was situated in a beautiful country near Richmond in Yorkshire.\r\nShe would not consent to this proposition, but as soon as she had\r\narranged the affairs which her brother's departure had caused to fall\r\nto her care, she quitted England and took me with her to her scotch\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nThe care of me while a baby, and afterwards untill I had reached my\r\neighth year devolved on a servant of my mother's, who had accompanied\r\nus in our retirement for that purpose. I was placed in a remote part\r\nof the house, and only saw my aunt at stated hours. These occurred\r\ntwice a day; once about noon she came to my nursery, and once after\r\nher dinner I was taken to her. She never caressed me, and seemed all\r\nthe time I staid in the room to fear that I should annoy her by some\r\nchildish freak. My good nurse always schooled me with the greatest\r\ncare before she ventured into the parlour--and the awe my aunt's cold\r\nlooks and few constrained words inspired was so great that I seldom\r\ndisgraced her lessons or was betrayed from the exemplary stillness\r\nwhich I was taught to observe during these short visits.[11]\r\n\r\nUnder my good nurse's care I ran wild about our park and the\r\nneighbouring fields. The offspring of the deepest love I displayed\r\nfrom my earliest years the greatest sensibility of disposition. I\r\ncannot say with what passion I loved every thing even the inanimate\r\nobjects that surrounded me. I believe that I bore an individual\r\nattachment to every tree in our park; every animal that inhabited it\r\nknew me and I loved them. Their occasional deaths filled my infant\r\nheart with anguish. I cannot number the birds that I have saved during\r\nthe long and severe winters of that climate; or the hares and rabbits\r\nthat I have defended from the attacks of our dogs, or have nursed when\r\naccidentally wounded.\r\n\r\nWhen I was seven years of age my nurse left me. I now forget the cause\r\nof her departure if indeed I ever knew it. She returned to England,\r\nand the bitter tears she shed at parting were the last I saw flow for\r\nlove of me for many years. My grief was terrible: I had no friend but\r\nher in the whole world. By degrees I became reconciled to solitude but\r\nno one supplied her place in my affections. I lived in a desolate\r\ncountry where\r\n\r\n    ------ there were none to praise\r\n    And very few to love.[A]\r\n\r\nIt is true that I now saw a little more of my aunt, but she was in\r\nevery way an unsocial being; and to a timid child she was as a plant\r\nbeneath a thick covering of ice; I should cut my hands in endeavouring\r\nto get at it. So I was entirely thrown upon my own resourses. The\r\nneighbouring minister was engaged to give me lessons in reading,\r\nwriting and french, but he was without family and his manners even to\r\nme were always perfectly characteristic of the profession in the\r\nexercise of whose functions he chiefly shone, that of a schoolmaster.\r\nI sometimes strove to form friendships with the most attractive of the\r\ngirls who inhabited the neighbouring village; but I believe I should\r\nnever have succeeded [even] had not my aunt interposed her authority\r\nto prevent all intercourse between me and the peasantry; for she was\r\nfearful lest I should acquire the scotch accent and dialect; a little\r\nof it I had, although great pains was taken that my tongue should not\r\ndisgrace my English origin.\r\n\r\nAs I grew older my liberty encreased with my desires, and my\r\nwanderings extended from our park to the neighbouring country. Our\r\nhouse was situated on the shores of the lake and the lawn came down to\r\nthe water's edge. I rambled amidst the wild scenery of this lovely\r\ncountry and became a complete mountaineer: I passed hours on the steep\r\nbrow of a mountain that overhung a waterfall or rowed myself in a\r\nlittle skiff to some one of the islands. I wandered for ever about\r\nthese lovely solitudes, gathering flower after flower\r\n\r\n    Ond' era pinta tutta la mia via[B]\r\n\r\nsinging as I might the wild melodies of the country, or occupied by\r\npleasant day dreams. My greatest pleasure was the enjoyment of a\r\nserene sky amidst these verdant woods: yet I loved all the changes of\r\nNature; and rain, and storm, and the beautiful clouds of heaven\r\nbrought their delights with them. When rocked by the waves of the lake\r\nmy spirits rose in triumph as a horseman feels with pride the motions\r\nof his high fed steed.\r\n\r\nBut my pleasures arose from the contemplation of nature alone, I had\r\nno companion: my warm affections finding no return from any other\r\nhuman heart were forced to run waste on inanimate objects.[12]\r\nSometimes indeed I wept when my aunt received my caresses with\r\nrepulsive coldness, and when I looked round and found none to love;\r\nbut I quickly dried my tears. As I grew older books in some degree\r\nsupplied the place of human intercourse: the library of my aunt was\r\nvery small; Shakespear, Milton, Pope and Cowper were the strangley\r\n[_sic_] assorted poets of her collection; and among the prose authors\r\na translation of Livy and Rollin's ancient history were my chief\r\nfavourites although as I emerged from childhood I found others highly\r\ninteresting which I had before neglected as dull.\r\n\r\nWhen I was twelve years old it occurred to my aunt that I ought to\r\nlearn music; she herself played upon the harp. It was with great\r\nhesitation that she persuaded herself to undertake my instruction; yet\r\nbelieving this accomplishment a necessary part of my education, and\r\nbalancing the evils of this measure or of having some one in the house\r\nto instruct me she submitted to the inconvenience. A harp was sent for\r\nthat my playing might not interfere with hers, and I began: she found\r\nme a docile and when I had conquered the first rudiments a very apt\r\nscholar. I had acquired in my harp a companion in rainy days; a sweet\r\nsoother of my feelings when any untoward accident ruffled them: I\r\noften addressed it as my only friend; I could pour forth to it my\r\nhopes and loves, and I fancied that its sweet accents answered me. I\r\nhave now mentioned all my studies.\r\n\r\nI was a solitary being, and from my infant years, ever since my dear\r\nnurse left me, I had been a dreamer. I brought Rosalind and Miranda\r\nand the lady of Comus to life to be my companions, or on my isle acted\r\nover their parts imagining myself to be in their situations. Then I\r\nwandered from the fancies of others and formed affections and\r\nintimacies with the aerial creations of my own brain--but still\r\nclinging to reality I gave a name to these conceptions and nursed them\r\nin the hope of realization. I clung to the memory of my parents; my\r\nmother I should never see, she was dead: but the idea of [my] unhappy,\r\nwandering father was the idol of my imagination. I bestowed on him all\r\nmy affections; there was a miniature of him that I gazed on\r\ncontinually; I copied his last letter and read it again and again.\r\nSometimes it made me weep; and at other [times] I repeated with\r\ntransport those words,--\"One day I may claim her at your hands.\" I was\r\nto be his consoler, his companion in after years. My favourite vision\r\nwas that when I grew up I would leave my aunt, whose coldness lulled\r\nmy conscience, and disguised like a boy I would seek my father through\r\nthe world. My imagination hung upon the scene of recognition; his\r\nminiature, which I should continually wear exposed on my breast, would\r\nbe the means and I imaged the moment to my mind a thousand and a\r\nthousand times, perpetually varying the circumstances. Sometimes it\r\nwould be in a desart; in a populous city; at a ball; we should perhaps\r\nmeet in a vessel; and his first words constantly were, \"My daughter, I\r\nlove thee\"! What extactic moments have I passed in these dreams! How\r\nmany tears I have shed; how often have I laughed aloud.[13]\r\n\r\nThis was my life for sixteen years. At fourteen and fifteen I often\r\nthought that the time was come when I should commence my pilgrimage,\r\nwhich I had cheated my own mind into believing was my imperious duty:\r\nbut a reluctance to quit my Aunt; a remorse for the grief which, I\r\ncould not conceal from myself, I should occasion her for ever\r\nwithheld me. Sometimes when I had planned the next morning for my\r\nescape a word of more than usual affection from her lips made me\r\npostpone my resolution. I reproached myself bitterly for what I called\r\na culpable weakness; but this weakness returned upon me whenever the\r\ncritical moment approached, and I never found courage to depart.[14]\r\n\r\n\r\n[A] Wordsworth\r\n\r\n[B] Dante\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on my sixteenth birthday that my aunt received a letter from my\r\nfather. I cannot describe the tumult of emotions that arose within me\r\nas I read it. It was dated from London; he had returned![15] I could\r\nonly relieve my transports by tears, tears of unmingled joy. He had\r\nreturned, and he wrote to know whether my aunt would come to London or\r\nwhether he should visit her in Scotland. How delicious to me were the\r\nwords of his letter that concerned me: \"I cannot tell you,\" it said,\r\n\"how ardently I desire to see my Mathilda. I look on her as the\r\ncreature who will form the happiness of my future life: she is all\r\nthat exists on earth that interests me. I can hardly prevent myself\r\nfrom hastening immediately to you but I am necessarily detained a week\r\nand I write because if you come here I may see you somewhat sooner.\" I\r\nread these words with devouring eyes; I kissed them, wept over them\r\nand exclaimed, \"He will love me!\"--\r\n\r\nMy aunt would not undertake so long a journey, and in a fortnight we\r\nhad another letter from my father, it was dated Edinburgh: he wrote\r\nthat he should be with us in three days. \"As he approached his desire\r\nof seeing me,\" he said, \"became more and more ardent, and he felt that\r\nthe moment when he should first clasp me in his arms would be the\r\nhappiest of his life.\"\r\n\r\nHow irksome were these three days to me! All sleep and appetite fled\r\nfrom me; I could only read and re-read his letter, and in the solitude\r\nof the woods imagine the moment of our meeting. On the eve of the\r\nthird day I retired early to my room; I could not sleep but paced all\r\nnight about my chamber and, as you may in Scotland at midsummer,\r\nwatched the crimson track of the sun as it almost skirted the northern\r\nhorizon. At day break I hastened to the woods; the hours past on while\r\nI indulged in wild dreams that gave wings to the slothful steps of\r\ntime, and beguiled my eager impatience. My father was expected at noon\r\nbut when I wished to return to me[e]t him I found that I had lost my\r\nway: it seemed that in every attempt to find it I only became more\r\ninvolved in the intracacies of the woods, and the trees hid all trace\r\nby which I might be guided.[16] I grew impatient, I wept; [_sic_] and\r\nwrung my hands but still I could not discover my path.\r\n\r\nIt was past two o'clock when by a sudden turn I found myself close to\r\nthe lake near a cove where a little skiff was moored--It was not far\r\nfrom our house and I saw my father and aunt walking on the lawn. I\r\njumped into the boat, and well accustomed to such feats, I pushed it\r\nfrom shore, and exerted all my strength to row swiftly across. As I\r\ncame, dressed in white, covered only by my tartan _rachan_, my hair\r\nstreaming on my shoulders, and shooting across with greater speed that\r\nit could be supposed I could give to my boat, my father has often told\r\nme that I looked more like a spirit than a human maid. I approached\r\nthe shore, my father held the boat, I leapt lightly out, and in a\r\nmoment was in his arms.\r\n\r\nAnd now I began to live. All around me was changed from a dull\r\nuniformity to the brightest scene of joy and delight. The happiness I\r\nenjoyed in the company of my father far exceeded my sanguine\r\nexpectations. We were for ever together; and the subjects of our\r\nconversations were inexhaustible. He had passed the sixteen years of\r\nabsence among nations nearly unknown to Europe; he had wandered\r\nthrough Persia, Arabia and the north of India and had penetrated among\r\nthe habitations of the natives with a freedom permitted to few\r\nEuropeans. His relations of their manners, his anecdotes and\r\ndescriptions of scenery whiled away delicious hours, when we were\r\ntired of talking of our own plans of future life.\r\n\r\nThe voice of affection was so new to me that I hung with delight upon\r\nhis words when he told me what he had felt concerning me during these\r\nlong years of apparent forgetfulness. \"At first\"--said he, \"I could\r\nnot bear to think of my poor little girl; but afterwards as grief wore\r\noff and hope again revisited me I could only turn to her, and amidst\r\ncities and desarts her little fairy form, such as I imagined it, for\r\never flitted before me. The northern breeze as it refreshed me was\r\nsweeter and more balmy for it seemed to carry some of your spirit\r\nalong with it. I often thought that I would instantly return and take\r\nyou along with me to some fertile island where we should live at peace\r\nfor ever. As I returned my fervent hopes were dashed by so many fears;\r\nmy impatience became in the highest degree painful. I dared not think\r\nthat the sun should shine and the moon rise not on your living form\r\nbut on your grave. But, no, it is not so; I have my Mathilda, my\r\nconsolation, and my hope.\"--\r\n\r\nMy father was very little changed from what he described himself to be\r\nbefore his misfortunes. It is intercourse with civilized society; it\r\nis the disappointment of cherished hopes, the falsehood of friends, or\r\nthe perpetual clash of mean passions that changes the heart and damps\r\nthe ardour of youthful feelings; lonly wanderings in a wild country\r\namong people of simple or savage manners may inure the body but will\r\nnot tame the soul, or extinguish the ardour and freshness of feeling\r\nincident to youth. The burning sun of India, and the freedom from all\r\nrestraint had rather encreased the energy of his character: before he\r\nbowed under, now he was impatient of any censure except that of his\r\nown mind. He had seen so many customs and witnessed so great a variety\r\nof moral creeds that he had been obliged to form an independant one\r\nfor himself which had no relation to the peculiar notions of any one\r\ncountry: his early prejudices of course influenced his judgement in\r\nthe formation of his principles, and some raw colledge ideas were\r\nstrangely mingled with the deepest deductions of his penetrating mind.\r\n\r\nThe vacuity his heart endured of any deep interest in life during his\r\nlong absence from his native country had had a singular effect upon\r\nhis ideas. There was a curious feeling of unreality attached by him to\r\nhis foreign life in comparison with the years of his youth. All the\r\ntime he had passed out of England was as a dream, and all the interest\r\nof his soul[,] all his affections belonged to events which had\r\nhappened and persons who had existed sixteen years before. It was\r\nstrange when you heard him talk to see how he passed over this lapse\r\nof time as a night of visions; while the remembrances of his youth\r\nstanding seperate as they did from his after life had lost none of\r\ntheir vigour. He talked of my Mother as if she had lived but a few\r\nweeks before; not that he expressed poignant grief, but his\r\ndiscription of her person, and his relation of all anecdotes connected\r\nwith her was thus fervent and vivid.\r\n\r\nIn all this there was a strangeness that attracted and enchanted me.\r\nHe was, as it were, now awakened from his long, visionary sleep, and\r\nhe felt some what like one of the seven sleepers, or like\r\nNourjahad,[17] in that sweet imitation of an eastern tale: Diana was\r\ngone; his friends were changed or dead, and now on his awakening I was\r\nall that he had to love on earth.\r\n\r\nHow dear to me were the waters, and mountains, and woods of Loch\r\nLomond now that I had so beloved a companion for my rambles. I visited\r\nwith my father every delightful spot, either on the islands, or by the\r\nside of the tree-sheltered waterfalls; every shady path, or dingle\r\nentangled with underwood and fern. My ideas were enlarged by his\r\nconversation. I felt as if I were recreated and had about me all the\r\nfreshness and life of a new being: I was, as it were, transported\r\nsince his arrival from a narrow spot of earth into a universe\r\nboundless to the imagination and the understanding. My life had been\r\nbefore as a pleasing country rill, never destined to leave its native\r\nfields, but when its task was fulfilled quietly to be absorbed, and\r\nleave no trace. Now it seemed to me to be as a various river flowing\r\nthrough a fertile and lovely lanscape, ever changing and ever\r\nbeautiful. Alas! I knew not the desart it was about to reach; the\r\nrocks that would tear its waters, and the hideous scene that would be\r\nreflected in a more distorted manner in its waves. Life was then\r\nbrilliant; I began to learn to hope and what brings a more bitter\r\ndespair to the heart than hope destroyed?\r\n\r\nIs it not strange[18] that grief should quickly follow so divine a\r\nhappiness? I drank of an enchanted cup but gall was at the bottom of\r\nits long drawn sweetness. My heart was full of deep affection, but it\r\nwas calm from its very depth and fulness. I had no idea that misery\r\ncould arise from love, and this lesson that all at last must learn was\r\ntaught me in a manner few are obliged to receive it. I lament now, I\r\nmust ever lament, those few short months of Paradisaical bliss; I\r\ndisobeyed no command, I ate no apple, and yet I was ruthlessly driven\r\nfrom it. Alas! my companion did, and I was precipitated in his\r\nfall.[19] But I wander from my relation--let woe come at its appointed\r\ntime; I may at this stage of my story still talk of happiness.\r\n\r\nThree months passed away in this delightful intercourse, when my aunt\r\nfell ill. I passed a whole month in her chamber nursing her, but her\r\ndisease was mortal and she died, leaving me for some time\r\ninconsolable, Death is so dreadful to the living;[20] the chains of\r\nhabit are so strong even when affection does not link them that the\r\nheart must be agonized when they break. But my father was beside me to\r\nconsole me and to drive away bitter memories by bright hopes:\r\nmethought that it was sweet to grieve that he might dry my tears.\r\n\r\nThen again he distracted my thoughts from my sorrow by comparing it\r\nwith his despair when he lost my mother. Even at that time I shuddered\r\nat the picture he drew of his passions: he had the imagination of a\r\npoet, and when he described the whirlwind that then tore his feelings\r\nhe gave his words the impress of life so vividly that I believed while\r\nI trembled. I wondered how he could ever again have entered into the\r\noffices of life after his wild thoughts seemed to have given him\r\naffinity with the unearthly; while he spoke so tremendous were the\r\nideas which he conveyed that it appeared as if the human heart were\r\nfar too bounded for their conception. His feelings seemed better\r\nfitted for a spirit whose habitation is the earthquake and the volcano\r\nthan for one confined to a mortal body and human lineaments. But these\r\nwere merely memories; he was changed since then. He was now all love,\r\nall softness; and when I raised my eyes in wonder at him as he spoke\r\nthe smile on his lips told me that his heart was possessed by the\r\ngentlest passions.\r\n\r\nTwo months after my aunt's death we removed to London where I was led\r\nby my father to attend to deeper studies than had before occupied me.\r\nMy improvement was his delight; he was with me during all my studies\r\nand assisted or joined with me in every lesson. We saw a great deal of\r\nsociety, and no day passed that my father did not endeavour to\r\nembellish by some new enjoyment. The tender attachment that he bore\r\nme, and the love and veneration with which I returned it cast a charm\r\nover every moment. The hours were slow for each minute was employed;\r\nwe lived more in one week than many do in the course of several months\r\nand the variety and novelty of our pleasures gave zest to each.\r\n\r\nWe perpetually made excursions together. And whether it were to visit\r\nbeautiful scenery, or to see fine pictures, or sometimes for no object\r\nbut to seek amusement as it might chance to arise, I was always happy\r\nwhen near my father. It was a subject of regret to me whenever we were\r\njoined by a third person, yet if I turned with a disturbed look\r\ntowards my father, his eyes fixed on me and beaming with tenderness\r\ninstantly restored joy to my heart. O, hours of intense delight! Short\r\nas ye were ye are made as long to me as a whole life when looked back\r\nupon through the mist of grief that rose immediately after as if to\r\nshut ye from my view. Alas! ye were the last of happiness that I ever\r\nenjoyed; a few, a very few weeks and all was destroyed. Like\r\nPsyche[21] I lived for awhile in an enchanted palace, amidst odours,\r\nand music, and every luxurious delight; when suddenly I was left on a\r\nbarren rock; a wide ocean of despair rolled around me: above all was\r\nblack, and my eyes closed while I still inhabited a universal death.\r\nStill I would not hurry on; I would pause for ever on the\r\nrecollections of these happy weeks; I would repeat every word, and how\r\nmany do I remember, record every enchantment of the faery habitation.\r\nBut, no, my tale must not pause; it must be as rapid as was my\r\nfate,--I can only describe in short although strong expressions my\r\nprecipitate and irremediable change from happiness to despair.[22]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong our most assiduous visitors was a young man of rank, well\r\ninformed, and agreable in his person. After we had spent a few weeks\r\nin London his attentions towards me became marked and his visits more\r\nfrequent. I was too much taken up by my own occupations and feelings\r\nto attend much to this, and then indeed I hardly noticed more than the\r\nbare surface of events as they passed around me; but I now remember\r\nthat my father was restless and uneasy whenever this person visited\r\nus, and when we talked together watched us with the greatest apparent\r\nanxiety although he himself maintained a profound silence. At length\r\nthese obnoxious visits suddenly ceased altogether, but from that\r\nmoment I must date the change of my father: a change that to remember\r\nmakes me shudder and then filled me with the deepest grief. There were\r\nno degrees which could break my fall from happiness to misery; it was\r\nas the stroke of lightning--sudden and entire.[23] Alas! I now met\r\nfrowns where before I had been welcomed only with smiles: he, my\r\nbeloved father, shunned me, and either treated me with harshness or a\r\nmore heart-breaking coldness. We took no more sweet counsel together;\r\nand when I tried to win him again to me, his anger, and the terrible\r\nemotions that he exhibited drove me to silence and tears.\r\n\r\nAnd this was sudden. The day before we had passed alone together in\r\nthe country; I remember we had talked of future travels that we should\r\nundertake together--. There was an eager delight in our tones and\r\ngestures that could only spring from deep & mutual love joined to the\r\nmost unrestrained confidence[;] and now the next day, the next hour, I\r\nsaw his brows contracted, his eyes fixed in sullen fierceness on the\r\nground, and his voice so gentle and so dear made me shiver when he\r\naddressed me. Often, when my wandering fancy brought by its various\r\nimages now consolation and now aggravation of grief to my heart,[24] I\r\nhave compared myself to Proserpine who was gaily and heedlessly\r\ngathering flowers on the sweet plain of Enna, when the King of Hell\r\nsnatched her away to the abodes of death and misery. Alas! I who so\r\nlately knew of nought but the joy of life; who had slept only to\r\ndream sweet dreams and awoke to incomparable happiness, I now passed\r\nmy days and nights in tears. I who sought and had found joy in the\r\nlove-breathing countenance of my father now when I dared fix on him a\r\nsupplicating look it was ever answered by an angry frown. I dared not\r\nspeak to him; and when sometimes I had worked up courage to meet him\r\nand to ask an explanation one glance at his face where a chaos of\r\nmighty passion seemed for ever struggling made me tremble and shrink\r\nto silence. I was dashed down from heaven to earth as a silly sparrow\r\nwhen pounced on by a hawk; my eyes swam and my head was bewildered by\r\nthe sudden apparition of grief. Day after day[25] passed marked only\r\nby my complaints and my tears; often I lifted my soul in vain prayer\r\nfor a softer descent from joy to woe, or if that were denied me that I\r\nmight be allowed to die, and fade for ever under the cruel blast that\r\nswept over me,\r\n\r\n    ------ for what should I do here,\r\n    Like a decaying flower, still withering\r\n    Under his bitter words, whose kindly heat\r\n    Should give my poor heart life?[C]\r\n\r\nSometimes I said to myself, this is an enchantment, and I must strive\r\nagainst it. My father is blinded by some malignant vision which I must\r\nremove. And then, like David, I would try music to win the evil spirit\r\nfrom him; and once while singing I lifted my eyes towards him and saw\r\nhis fixed on me and filled with tears; all his muscles seemed relaxed\r\nto softness. I sprung towards him with a cry of joy and would have\r\nthrown myself into his arms, but he pushed me roughly from him and\r\nleft me. And even from this slight incident he contracted fresh gloom\r\nand an additional severity of manner.\r\n\r\nThere are many incidents that I might relate which shewed the diseased\r\nyet incomprehensible state of his mind; but I will mention one that\r\noccurred while we were in company with several other persons. On this\r\noccasion I chanced to say that I thought Myrrha the best of Alfieri's\r\ntragedies; as I said this I chanced to cast my eyes on my father and\r\nmet his: for the first time the expression of those beloved eyes\r\ndispleased me, and I saw with affright that his whole frame shook with\r\nsome concealed emotion that in spite of his efforts half conquered\r\nhim: as this tempest faded from his soul he became melancholy and\r\nsilent. Every day some new scene occured and displayed in him a mind\r\nworking as [it] were with an unknown horror that now he could master\r\nbut which at times threatened to overturn his reason, and to throw the\r\nbright seat of his intelligence into a perpetual chaos.\r\n\r\nI will not dwell longer than I need on these disastrous\r\ncircumstances.[26] I might waste days in describing how anxiously I\r\nwatched every change of fleeting circumstance that promised better\r\ndays, and with what despair I found that each effort of mine\r\naggravated his seeming madness. To tell all my grief I might as well\r\nattempt to count the tears that have fallen from these eyes, or every\r\nsign that has torn my heart. I will be brief for there is in all this\r\na horror that will not bear many words, and I sink almost a second\r\ntime to death while I recall these sad scenes to my memory. Oh, my\r\nbeloved father! Indeed you made me miserable beyond all words, but how\r\ntruly did I even then forgive you, and how entirely did you possess my\r\nwhole heart while I endeavoured, as a rainbow gleams upon a\r\ncataract,[D][27] to soften thy tremendous sorrows.\r\n\r\nThus did this change come about. I seem perhaps to have dashed too\r\nsuddenly into the description, but thus suddenly did it happen. In one\r\nsentence I have passed from the idea of unspeakable happiness to that\r\nof unspeakable grief but they were thus closely linked together. We\r\nhad remained five months in London three of joy and two of sorrow. My\r\nfather and I were now seldom alone or if we were he generally kept\r\nsilence with his eyes fixed on the ground--the dark full orbs in which\r\nbefore I delighted to read all sweet and gentle feeling shadowed from\r\nmy sight by their lids and the long lashes that fringed them. When we\r\nwere in company he affected gaiety but I wept to hear his hollow\r\nlaugh--begun by an empty smile and often ending in a bitter sneer such\r\nas never before this fatal period had wrinkled his lips. When others\r\nwere there he often spoke to me and his eyes perpetually followed my\r\nslightest motion. His accents whenever he addressed me were cold and\r\nconstrained although his voice would tremble when he perceived that my\r\nfull heart choked the answer to words proffered with a mien yet new to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nBut days of peaceful melancholy were of rare occurence[:] they were\r\noften broken in upon by gusts of passion that drove me as a weak boat\r\non a stormy sea to seek a cove for shelter; but the winds blew from my\r\nnative harbour and I was cast far, far out untill shattered I perished\r\nwhen the tempest had passed and the sea was apparently calm. I do not\r\nknow that I can describe his emotions: sometimes he only betrayed them\r\nby a word or gesture, and then retired to his chamber and I crept as\r\nnear it as I dared and listened with fear to every sound, yet still\r\nmore dreading a sudden silence--dreading I knew not what, but ever\r\nfull of fear.\r\n\r\nIt was after one tremendous day when his eyes had glared on me like\r\nlightning--and his voice sharp and broken seemed unable to express the\r\nextent of his emotion that in the evening when I was alone he joined\r\nme with a calm countenance, and not noticing my tears which I quickly\r\ndried when he approached, told me that in three days that [_sic_] he\r\nintended to remove with me to his estate in Yorkshire, and bidding me\r\nprepare left me hastily as if afraid of being questioned.\r\n\r\nThis determination on his part indeed surprised me. This estate was\r\nthat which he had inhabited in childhood and near which my mother\r\nresided while a girl; this was the scene of their youthful loves and\r\nwhere they had lived after their marriage; in happier days my father\r\nhad often told me that however he might appear weaned from his widow\r\nsorrow, and free from bitter recollections elsewhere, yet he would\r\nnever dare visit the spot where he had enjoyed her society or trust\r\nhimself to see the rooms that so many years ago they had inhabited\r\ntogether; her favourite walks and the gardens the flowers of which she\r\nhad delighted to cultivate. And now while he suffered intense misery\r\nhe determined to plunge into still more intense, and strove for\r\ngreater emotion than that which already tore him. I was perplexed, and\r\nmost anxious to know what this portended; ah, what could it po[r]tend\r\nbut ruin!\r\n\r\nI saw little of my father during this interval, but he appeared calmer\r\nalthough not less unhappy than before. On the morning of the third day\r\nhe informed me that he had determined to go to Yorkshire first alone,\r\nand that I should follow him in a fortnight unless I heard any thing\r\nfrom him in the mean time that should contradict this command. He\r\ndeparted the same day, and four days afterwards I received a letter\r\nfrom his steward telling me in his name to join him with as little\r\ndelay as possible. After travelling day and night I arrived with an\r\nanxious, yet a hoping heart, for why should he send for me if it were\r\nonly to avoid me and to treat me with the apparent aversion that he\r\nhad in London. I met him at the distance of thirty miles from our\r\nmansion. His demeanour was sad; for a moment he appeared glad to see\r\nme and then he checked himself as if unwilling to betray his feelings.\r\nHe was silent during our ride, yet his manner was kinder than before\r\nand I thought I beheld a softness in his eyes that gave me hope.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived, after a little rest, he led me over the house and\r\npointed out to me the rooms which my mother had inhabited. Although\r\nmore than sixteen years had passed since her death nothing had been\r\nchanged; her work box, her writing desk were still there and in her\r\nroom a book lay open on the table as she had left it. My father\r\npointed out these circumstances with a serious and unaltered mien,\r\nonly now and then fixing his deep and liquid eyes upon me; there was\r\nsomething strange and awful in his look that overcame me, and in spite\r\nof myself I wept, nor did he attempt to console me, but I saw his lips\r\nquiver and the muscles of his countenance seemed convulsed.\r\n\r\nWe walked together in the gardens and in the evening when I would have\r\nretired he asked me to stay and read to him; and first said, \"When I\r\nwas last here your mother read Dante to me; you shall go on where she\r\nleft off.\" And then in a moment he said, \"No, that must not be; you\r\nmust not read Dante. Do you choose a book.\" I took up Spencer and read\r\nthe descent of Sir Guyon to the halls of Avarice;[28] while he\r\nlistened his eyes fixed on me in sad profound silence.\r\n\r\nI heard the next morning from the steward that upon his arrival he had\r\nbeen in a most terrible state of mind: he had passed the first night\r\nin the garden lying on the damp grass; he did not sleep but groaned\r\nperpetually. \"Alas!\" said the old man[,] who gave me this account with\r\ntears in his eyes, \"it wrings my heart to see my lord in this state:\r\nwhen I heard that he was coming down here with you, my young lady, I\r\nthought we should have the happy days over again that we enjoyed\r\nduring the short life of my lady your mother--But that would be too\r\nmuch happiness for us poor creatures born to tears--and that was why\r\nshe was taken from us so soon; [s]he was too beautiful and good for\r\nus[.] It was a happy day as we all thought it when my lord married\r\nher: I knew her when she was a child and many a good turn has she done\r\nfor me in my old lady's time--You are like her although there is more\r\nof my lord in you--But has he been thus ever since his return? All my\r\njoy turned to sorrow when I first beheld him with that melancholy\r\ncountenance enter these doors as it were the day after my lady's\r\nfuneral--He seemed to recover himself a little after he had bidden me\r\nwrite to you--but still it is a woful thing to see him so\r\nunhappy.\"[29] These were the feelings of an old, faithful servant:\r\nwhat must be those of an affectionate daughter. Alas! Even then my\r\nheart was almost broken.\r\n\r\nWe spent two months together in this house. My father spent the\r\ngreater part of his time with me; he accompanied me in my walks,\r\nlistened to my music, and leant over me as I read or painted. When he\r\nconversed with me his manner was cold and constrained; his eyes only\r\nseemed to speak, and as he turned their black, full lustre towards me\r\nthey expressed a living sadness. There was somthing in those dark deep\r\norbs so liquid, and intense that even in happiness I could never meet\r\ntheir full gaze that mine did not overflow. Yet it was with sweet\r\ntears; now there was a depth of affliction in their gentle appeal that\r\nrent my heart with sympathy; they seemed to desire peace for me; for\r\nhimself a heart patient to suffer; a craving for sympathy, yet a\r\nperpetual self denial. It was only when he was absent from me that his\r\npassion subdued him,--that he clinched his hands--knit his brows--and\r\nwith haggard looks called for death to his despair, raving wildly,\r\nuntill exhausted he sank down nor was revived untill I joined him.\r\n\r\nWhile we were in London there was a harshness and sulleness in his\r\nsorrow which had now entirely disappeared. There I shrunk and fled\r\nfrom him, now I only wished to be with him that I might soothe him to\r\npeace. When he was silent I tried to divert him, and when sometimes I\r\nstole to him during the energy of his passion I wept but did not\r\ndesire to leave him. Yet he suffered fearful agony; during the day he\r\nwas more calm, but at night when I could not be with him he seemed to\r\ngive the reins to his grief: he often passed his nights either on the\r\nfloor in my mother's room, or in the garden; and when in the morning\r\nhe saw me view with poignant grief his exhausted frame, and his person\r\nlanguid almost to death with watching he wept; but during all this\r\ntime he spoke no word by which I might guess the cause of his\r\nunhappiness[.] If I ventured to enquire he would either leave me or\r\npress his finger on his lips, and with a deprecating look that I could\r\nnot resist, turn away. If I wept he would gaze on me in silence but he\r\nwas no longer harsh and although he repulsed every caress yet it was\r\nwith gentleness.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to cherish a mild grief and softer emotions although sad as\r\na relief from despair--He contrived in many ways to nurse his\r\nmelancholy as an antidote to wilder passion[.] He perpetually\r\nfrequented the walks that had been favourites with him when he and my\r\nmother wandered together talking of love and happiness; he collected\r\nevery relick that remained of her and always sat opposite her picture\r\nwhich hung in the room fixing on it a look of sad despair--and all\r\nthis was done in a mystic and awful silence. If his passion subdued\r\nhim he locked himself in his room; and at night when he wandered\r\nrestlessly about the house, it was when every other creature slept.\r\n\r\nIt may easily be imagined that I wearied myself with conjecture to\r\nguess the cause of his sorrow. The solution that seemed to me the most\r\nprobable was that during his residence in London he had fallen in love\r\nwith some unworthy person, and that his passion mastered him although\r\nhe would not gratify it: he loved me too well to sacrifise me to this\r\ninclination, and that he had now visited this house that by reviving\r\nthe memory of my mother whom he so passionately adored he might weaken\r\nthe present impression. This was possible; but it was a mere\r\nconjecture unfounded on any fact. Could there be guilt in it? He was\r\ntoo upright and noble to _do_ aught that his conscience would not\r\napprove; I did not yet know of the crime there may be in involuntary\r\nfeeling and therefore ascribed his tumultuous starts and gloomy looks\r\nwholly to the struggles of his mind and not any as they were partly\r\ndue to the worst fiend of all--Remorse.[30]\r\n\r\nBut still do I flatter myself that this would have passed away. His\r\nparoxisms of passion were terrific but his soul bore him through them\r\ntriumphant, though almost destroyed by victory; but the day would\r\nfinally have been won had not I, foolish and presumtuous wretch!\r\nhurried him on untill there was no recall, no hope. My rashness gave\r\nthe victory in this dreadful fight to the enemy who triumphed over him\r\nas he lay fallen and vanquished. I! I alone was the cause of his\r\ndefeat and justly did I pay the fearful penalty. I said to myself, let\r\nhim receive sympathy and these struggles will cease. Let him confide\r\nhis misery to another heart and half the weight of it will be\r\nlightened. I will win him to me; he shall not deny his grief to me and\r\nwhen I know his secret then will I pour a balm into his soul and again\r\nI shall enjoy the ravishing delight of beholding his smile, and of\r\nagain seeing his eyes beam if not with pleasure at least with gentle\r\nlove and thankfulness. This will I do, I said. Half I accomplished; I\r\ngained his secret and we were both lost for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n[C] Fletcher's comedy of the Captain.\r\n\r\n[D] Lord Byron\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly a year had past since my father's return, and the seasons had\r\nalmost finished their round--It was now the end of May; the woods were\r\nclothed in their freshest verdure, and the sweet smell of the new mown\r\ngrass was in the fields. I thought that the balmy air and the lovely\r\nface of Nature might aid me in inspiring him with mild sensations, and\r\ngive him gentle feelings of peace and love preparatory to the\r\nconfidence I determined to win from him.\r\n\r\nI chose therefore the evening of one of these days for my attempt. I\r\ninvited him to walk with me, and led him to a neighbouring wood of\r\nbeech trees whose light shade shielded us from the slant and dazzling\r\nbeams of the descending sun--After walking for some time in silence I\r\nseated my self with him on a mossy hillock--It is strange but even now\r\nI seem to see the spot--the slim and smooth trunks were many of them\r\nwound round by ivy whose shining leaves of the darkest green\r\ncontrasted with the white bark and the light leaves of the young\r\nsprouts of beech that grew from their parent trunks--the short grass\r\nwas mingled with moss and was partly covered by the dead leaves of the\r\nlast autumn that driven by the winds had here and there collected in\r\nlittle hillocks--there were a few moss grown stumps about--The leaves\r\nwere gently moved by the breeze and through their green canopy you\r\ncould see the bright blue sky--As evening came on the distant trunks\r\nwere reddened by the sun and the wind died entirely away while a few\r\nbirds flew past us to their evening rest.\r\n\r\nWell it was here we sat together, and when you hear all that past--all\r\nthat of terrible tore our souls even in this placid spot, which but\r\nfor strange passions might have been a paradise to us, you will not\r\nwonder that I remember it as I looked on it that its calm might give\r\nme calm, and inspire me not only with courage but with persuasive\r\nwords. I saw all these things and in a vacant manner noted them in my\r\nmind[31] while I endeavoured to arrange my thoughts in fitting order\r\nfor my attempt. My heart beat fast as I worked myself up to speak to\r\nhim, for I was determined not to be repulsed but I trembled to imagine\r\nwhat effect my words might have on him; at length, with much\r\nhesitation I began:[32]\r\n\r\n\"Your kindness to me, my dearest father, and the affection--the\r\nexcessive affection--that you had for me when you first returned will\r\nI hope excuse me in your eyes that I dare speak to you, although with\r\nthe tender affection of a daughter, yet also with the freedom of a\r\nfriend and equal. But pardon me, I entreat you and listen to me: do\r\nnot turn away from me; do not be impatient; you may easily intimidate\r\nme into silence, but my heart is bursting, nor can I willingly consent\r\nto endure for one moment longer the agony of uncertitude which for the\r\nlast four months has been my portion.\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me, dearest friend, and permit me to gain your confidence.\r\nAre the happy days of mutual love which have passed to be to me as a\r\ndream never to return? Alas! You have a secret grief that destroys us\r\nboth: but you must permit me to win this secret from you. Tell me, can\r\nI do nothing? You well know that on the whole earth there is no\r\nsacrifise that I would not make, no labour that I would not undergo\r\nwith the mere hope that I might bring you ease. But if no endeavour on\r\nmy part can contribute to your happiness, let me at least know your\r\nsorrow, and surely my earnest love and deep sympathy must soothe your\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n\"I fear that I speak in a constrained manner: my heart is overflowing\r\nwith the ardent desire I have of bringing calm once more to your\r\nthoughts and looks; but I fear to aggravate your grief, or to raise\r\nthat in you which is death to me, anger and distaste. Do not then\r\ncontinue to fix your eyes on the earth; raise them on me for I can\r\nread your soul in them: speak to me to me [_sic_], and pardon my\r\npresumption. Alas! I am a most unhappy creature!\"\r\n\r\nI was breathless with emotion, and I paused fixing my earnest eyes on\r\nmy father, after I had dashed away the intrusive tears that dimmed\r\nthem. He did not raise his, but after a short silence he replied to me\r\nin a low voice: \"You are indeed presumptuous, Mathilda, presumptuous\r\nand very rash. In the heart of one like me there are secret thoughts\r\nworking, and secret tortures which you ought not to seek to discover.\r\nI cannot tell you how it adds to my grief to know that I am the cause\r\nof uneasiness to you; but this will pass away, and I hope that soon we\r\nshall be as we were a few months ago. Restrain your impatience or you\r\nmay mar what you attempt to alleviate. Do not again speak to me in\r\nthis strain; but wait in submissive patience the event of what is\r\npassing around you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes!\" I passionately replied, \"I will be very patient; I will\r\nnot be rash or presumptuous: I will see the agonies, and tears, and\r\ndespair of my father, my only friend, my hope, my shelter, I will see\r\nit all with folded arms and downcast eyes. You do not treat me with\r\ncandour; it is not true what you say; this will not soon pass away, it\r\nwill last forever if you deign not to speak to me; to admit my\r\nconsolations.\r\n\r\n\"Dearest, dearest father, pity me and pardon me: I entreat you do not\r\ndrive me to despair; indeed I must not be repulsed; there is one thing\r\nthat which [_sic_] although it may torture me to know, yet that you\r\nmust tell me. I demand, and most solemnly I demand if in any way I am\r\nthe cause of your unhappiness. Do you not see my tears which I in vain\r\nstrive against--You hear unmoved my voice broken by sobs--Feel how my\r\nhand trembles: my whole heart is in the words I speak and you must not\r\nendeavour to silence me by mere words barren of meaning: the agony of\r\nmy doubt hurries me on, and you must reply. I beseech you; by your\r\nformer love for me now lost, I adjure you to answer that one question.\r\nAm I the cause of your grief?\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyes from the ground, but still turning them away from\r\nme, said: \"Besought by that plea I will answer your rash question.\r\nYes, you are the sole, the agonizing cause of all I suffer, of all I\r\nmust suffer untill I die. Now, beware! Be silent! Do not urge me to\r\nyour destruction. I am struck by the storm, rooted up, laid waste: but\r\nyou can stand against it; you are young and your passions are at\r\npeace. One word I might speak and then you would be implicated in my\r\ndestruction; yet that word is hovering on my lips. Oh! There is a\r\nfearful chasm; but I adjure you to beware!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, dearest friend!\" I cried, \"do not fear! Speak that word; it will\r\nbring peace, not death. If there is a chasm our mutual love will give\r\nus wings to pass it, and we shall find flowers, and verdure, and\r\ndelight on the other side.\" I threw myself at his feet, and took his\r\nhand, \"Yes, speak, and we shall be happy; there will no longer be\r\ndoubt, no dreadful uncertainty; trust me, my affection will soothe\r\nyour sorrow; speak that word and all danger will be past, and we shall\r\nlove each other as before, and for ever.\"\r\n\r\nHe snatched his hand from me, and rose in violent disorder: \"What do\r\nyou mean? You know not what you mean. Why do you bring me out, and\r\ntorture me, and tempt me, and kill me--Much happier would [it] be for\r\nyou and for me if in your frantic curiosity you tore my heart from my\r\nbreast and tried to read its secrets in it as its life's blood was\r\ndropping from it. Thus you may console me by reducing me to\r\nnothing--but your words I cannot bear; soon they will make me mad,\r\nquite mad, and then I shall utter strange words, and you will believe\r\nthem, and we shall be both lost for ever. I tell you I am on the very\r\nverge of insanity; why, cruel girl, do you drive me on: you will\r\nrepent and I shall die.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I repeat his words I wonder at my pertinacious folly; I hardly\r\nknow what feelings resis[t]lessly impelled me. I believe it was that\r\ncoming out with a determination not to be repulsed I went right\r\nforward to my object without well weighing his replies: I was led by\r\npassion and drew him with frantic heedlessness into the abyss that he\r\nso fearfully avoided--I replied to his terrific words: \"You fill me\r\nwith affright it is true, dearest father, but you only confirm my\r\nresolution to put an end to this state of doubt. I will not be put off\r\nthus: do you think that I can live thus fearfully from day to day--the\r\nsword in my bosom yet kept from its mortal wound by a hair--a word!--I\r\ndemand that dreadful word; though it be as a flash of lightning to\r\ndestroy me, speak it.\r\n\r\n\"Alas! Alas! What am I become? But a few months have elapsed since I\r\nbelieved that I was all the world to you; and that there was no\r\nhappiness or grief for you on earth unshared by your Mathilda--your\r\nchild: that happy time is no longer, and what I most dreaded in this\r\nworld is come upon me. In the despair of my heart I see what you\r\ncannot conceal: you no longer love me. I adjure you, my father, has\r\nnot an unnatural passion seized upon your heart? Am I not the most\r\nmiserable worm that crawls? Do I not embrace your knees, and you most\r\ncruelly repulse me? I know it--I see it--you hate me!\"\r\n\r\nI was transported by violent emotion, and rising from his feet, at\r\nwhich I had thrown myself, I leant against a tree, wildly raising my\r\neyes to heaven. He began to answer with violence: \"Yes, yes, I hate\r\nyou! You are my bane, my poison, my disgust! Oh! No[!]\" And then his\r\nmanner changed, and fixing his eyes on me with an expression that\r\nconvulsed every nerve and member of my frame--\"you are none of all\r\nthese; you are my light, my only one, my life.--My daughter, I love\r\nyou!\" The last words died away in a hoarse whisper, but I heard them\r\nand sunk on the ground, covering my face and almost dead with excess\r\nof sickness and fear: a cold perspiration covered my forehead and I\r\nshivered in every limb--But he continued, clasping his hands with a\r\nfrantic gesture:\r\n\r\n\"Now I have dashed from the top of the rock to the bottom! Now I have\r\nprecipitated myself down the fearful chasm! The danger is over; she is\r\nalive! Oh, Mathilda, lift up those dear eyes in the light of which I\r\nlive. Let me hear the sweet tones of your beloved voice in peace and\r\ncalm. Monster as I am, you are still, as you ever were, lovely,\r\nbeautiful beyond expression. What I have become since this last moment\r\nI know not; perhaps I am changed in mien as the fallen archangel. I do\r\nbelieve I am for I have surely a new soul within me, and my blood\r\nriots through my veins: I am burnt up with fever. But these are\r\nprecious moments; devil as I am become, yet that is my Mathilda before\r\nme whom I love as one was never before loved: and she knows it now;\r\nshe listens to these words which I thought, fool as I was, would blast\r\nher to death. Come, come, the worst is past: no more grief, tears or\r\ndespair; were not those the words you uttered?--We have leapt the\r\nchasm I told you of, and now, mark me, Mathilda, we are to find\r\nflowers, and verdure and delight, or is it hell, and fire, and\r\ntortures? Oh! Beloved One, I am borne away; I can no longer sustain\r\nmyself; surely this is death that is coming. Let me lay my head near\r\nyour heart; let me die in your arms!\"--He sunk to the earth fainting,\r\nwhile I, nearly as lifeless, gazed on him in despair.\r\n\r\nYes it was despair I felt; for the first time that phantom seized me;\r\nthe first and only time for it has never since left me--After the\r\nfirst moments of speechless agony I felt her fangs on my heart: I tore\r\nmy hair; I raved aloud; at one moment in pity for his sufferings I\r\nwould have clasped my father in my arms; and then starting back with\r\nhorror I spurned him with my foot; I felt as if stung by a serpent,\r\nas if scourged by a whip of scorpions which drove me--Ah!\r\nWhither--Whither?\r\n\r\nWell, this could not last. One idea rushed on my mind; never, never\r\nmay I speak to him again. As this terrible conviction came upon _him_\r\n[_me_?] it melted my soul to tenderness and love--I gazed on him as to\r\ntake my last farewell--he lay insensible--his eyes closed as [_and_?]\r\nhis cheeks deathly pale. Above, the leaves of the beech wood cast a\r\nflickering shadow on his face, and waved in mournful melody over\r\nhim--I saw all these things and said, \"Aye, this is his grave!\" And\r\nthen I wept aloud, and raised my eyes to heaven to entreat for a\r\nrespite to my despair and an alleviation for his unnatural\r\nsuffering--the tears that gushed in a warm & healing stream from my\r\neyes relieved the burthen that oppressed my heart almost to madness. I\r\nwept for a long time untill I saw him about to revive, when horror and\r\nmisery again recurred, and the tide of my sensations rolled back to\r\ntheir former channel: with a terror I could not restrain--I sprung up\r\nand fled, with winged speed, along the paths of the wood and across\r\nthe fields untill nearly dead I reached our house and just ordering\r\nthe servants to seek my father at the spot I indicated, I shut myself\r\nup in my own room[.][33]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nMy chamber was in a retired part of the house, and looked upon the\r\ngarden so that no sound of the other inhabitants could reach it; and\r\nhere in perfect solitude I wept for several hours. When a servant came\r\nto ask me if I would take food I learnt from him that my father had\r\nreturned, and was apparently well and this relieved me from a load of\r\nanxiety, yet I did not cease to weep bitterly. As [_At_] first, as the\r\nmemory of former happiness contrasted to my present despair came\r\nacross me, I gave relief to the oppression of heart that I felt by\r\nwords, and groans, and heart rending sighs: but nature became wearied,\r\nand this more violent grief gave place to a passionate but mute flood\r\nof tears: my whole soul seemed to dissolve [in] them. I did not wring\r\nmy hands, or tear my hair, or utter wild exclamations, but as Boccacio\r\ndescribes the intense and quiet grief [of] Sigismunda over the heart\r\nof Guiscardo,[34] I sat with my hands folded, silently letting fall a\r\nperpetual stream from my eyes. Such was the depth of my emotion that I\r\nhad no feeling of what caused my distress, my thoughts even wandered\r\nto many indifferent objects; but still neither moving limb or feature\r\nmy tears fell untill, as if the fountains were exhausted, they\r\ngradually subsided, and I awoke to life as from a dream.\r\n\r\nWhen I had ceased to weep reason and memory returned upon me, and I\r\nbegan to reflect with greater calmness on what had happened, and how\r\nit became me to act--A few hours only had passed but a mighty\r\nrevolution had taken place with regard to me--the natural work of\r\nyears had been transacted since the morning: my father was as dead to\r\nme, and I felt for a moment as if he with white hairs were laid in his\r\ncoffin and I--youth vanished in approaching age, were weeping at his\r\ntimely dissolution. But it was not so, I was yet young, Oh! far too\r\nyoung, nor was he dead to others; but I, most miserable, must never\r\nsee or speak to him again. I must fly from him with more earnestness\r\nthan from my greatest enemy: in solitude or in cities I must never\r\nmore behold him. That consideration made me breathless with anguish,\r\nand impressing itself on my imagination I was unable for a time to\r\nfollow up any train of ideas. Ever after this, I thought, I would\r\nlive in the most dreary seclusion. I would retire to the Continent and\r\nbecome a nun; not for religion's sake, for I was not a Catholic, but\r\nthat I might be for ever shut out from the world. I should there find\r\nsolitude where I might weep, and the voices of life might never reach\r\nme.\r\n\r\nBut my father; my beloved and most wretched father? Would he die?\r\nWould he never overcome the fierce passion that now held pityless\r\ndominion over him? Might he not many, many years hence, when age had\r\nquenched the burning sensations that he now experienced, might he not\r\nthen be again a father to me? This reflection unwrinkled my brow, and\r\nI could feel (and I wept to feel it) a half melancholy smile draw from\r\nmy lips their expression of suffering: I dared indulge better hopes\r\nfor my future life; years must pass but they would speed lightly away\r\nwinged by hope, or if they passed heavily, still they would pass and I\r\nhad not lost my father for ever. Let him spend another sixteen years\r\nof desolate wandering: let him once more utter his wild complaints to\r\nthe vast woods and the tremendous cataracts of another clime: let him\r\nagain undergo fearful danger and soul-quelling hardships: let the hot\r\nsun of the south again burn his passion worn cheeks and the cold night\r\nrains fall on him and chill his blood.\r\n\r\nTo this life, miserable father, I devote thee!--Go!--Be thy days\r\npassed with savages, and thy nights under the cope of heaven! Be thy\r\nlimbs worn and thy heart chilled, and all youth be dead within thee!\r\nLet thy hairs be as snow; thy walk trembling and thy voice have lost\r\nits mellow tones! Let the liquid lustre of thine eyes be quenched; and\r\nthen return to me, return to thy Mathilda, thy child, who may then be\r\nclasped in thy loved arms, while thy heart beats with sinless emotion.\r\nGo, Devoted One, and return thus!--This is my curse, a daughter's\r\ncurse: go, and return pure to thy child, who will never love aught but\r\nthee.\r\n\r\nThese were my thoughts; and with trembling hands I prepared to begin a\r\nletter to my unhappy parent. I had now spent many hours in tears and\r\nmournful meditation; it was past twelve o'clock; all was at peace in\r\nthe house, and the gentle air that stole in at my window did not\r\nrustle the leaves of the twining plants that shadowed it. I felt the\r\nentire tranquillity of the hour when my own breath and involuntary\r\nsobs were all the sounds that struck upon the air. On a sudden I heard\r\na gentle step ascending the stairs; I paused breathless, and as it\r\napproached glided into an obscure corner of the room; the steps paused\r\nat my door, but after a few moments they again receeded[,] descended\r\nthe stairs and I heard no more.\r\n\r\nThis slight incident gave rise in me to the most painful reflections;\r\nnor do I now dare express the emotions I felt. That he should be\r\nrestless I understood; that he should wander as an unlaid ghost and\r\nfind no quiet from the burning hell that consumed his heart. But why\r\napproach my chamber? Was not that sacred? I felt almost ready to faint\r\nwhile he had stood there, but I had not betrayed my wakefulness by the\r\nslightest motion, although I had heard my own heart beat with violent\r\nfear. He had withdrawn. Oh, never, never, may I see him again!\r\nTomorrow night the same roof may not cover us; he or I must depart.\r\nThe mutual link of our destinies is broken; we must be divided by\r\nseas--by land. The stars and the sun must not rise at the same period\r\nto us: he must not say, looking at the setting crescent of the moon,\r\n\"Mathilda now watches its fall.\"--No, all must be changed. Be it light\r\nwith him when it is darkness with me! Let him feel the sun of summer\r\nwhile I am chilled by the snows of winter! Let there be the distance\r\nof the antipodes between us!\r\n\r\nAt length the east began to brighten, and the comfortable light of\r\nmorning streamed into my room. I was weary with watching and for some\r\ntime I had combated with the heavy sleep that weighed down my eyelids:\r\nbut now, no longer fearful, I threw myself on my bed. I sought for\r\nrepose although I did not hope for forgetfulness; I knew I should be\r\npursued by dreams, but did not dread the frightful one that I really\r\nhad. I thought that I had risen and went to seek my father to inform\r\nhim of my determination to seperate myself from him. I sought him in\r\nthe house, in the park, and then in the fields and the woods, but I\r\ncould not find him. At length I saw him at some distance, seated under\r\na tree, and when he perceived me he waved his hand several times,\r\nbeckoning me to approach; there was something unearthly in his mien\r\nthat awed and chilled me, but I drew near. When at [a] short distance\r\nfrom him I saw that he was deadlily [_sic_] pale, and clothed in\r\nflowing garments of white. Suddenly he started up and fled from me; I\r\npursued him: we sped over the fields, and by the skirts of woods, and\r\non the banks of rivers; he flew fast and I followed. We came at last,\r\nmethought, to the brow of a huge cliff that over hung the sea which,\r\ntroubled by the winds, dashed against its base at a distance. I heard\r\nthe roar of the waters: he held his course right on towards the brink\r\nand I became breathless with fear lest he should plunge down the\r\ndreadful precipice; I tried to augment my speed, but my knees failed\r\nbeneath me, yet I had just reached him; just caught a part of his\r\nflowing robe, when he leapt down and I awoke with a violent scream. I\r\nwas trembling and my pillow was wet with my tears; for a few moments\r\nmy heart beat hard, but the bright beams of the sun and the chirping\r\nof the birds quickly restored me to myself, and I rose with a languid\r\nspirit, yet wondering what events the day would bring forth. Some time\r\npassed before I summoned courage to ring the bell for my servant, and\r\nwhen she came I still dared not utter my father's name. I ordered her\r\nto bring my breakfast to my room, and was again left alone--yet still\r\nI could make no resolve, but only thought that I might write a note to\r\nmy father to beg his permission to pay a visit to a relation who lived\r\nabout thirty miles off, and who had before invited me to her house,\r\nbut I had refused for then I could not quit my suffering father. When\r\nthe servant came back she gave me a letter.\r\n\r\n\"From whom is this letter[?]\" I asked trembling.\r\n\r\n\"Your father left it, madam, with his servant, to be given to you when\r\nyou should rise.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father left it! Where is he? Is he not here?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; he quitted the house before four this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God! He is gone! But tell how this was; speak quick!\"\r\n\r\nHer relation was short. He had gone in the carriage to the nearest\r\ntown where he took a post chaise and horses with orders for the London\r\nroad. He dismissed his servants there, only telling them that he had a\r\nsudden call of business and that they were to obey me as their\r\nmistress untill his return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a beating heart and fearful, I knew not why, I dismissed the\r\nservant and locking my door, sat down to read my father's letter.\r\nThese are the words that it contained.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Child\r\n\r\n\"I have betrayed your confidence; I have endeavoured to pollute your\r\nmind, and have made your innocent heart acquainted with the looks and\r\nlanguage of unlawful and monstrous passion. I must expiate these\r\ncrimes, and must endeavour in some degree to proportionate my\r\npunishment to my guilt. You are I doubt not prepared for what I am\r\nabout to announce; we must seperate and be divided for ever.\r\n\r\n\"I deprive you of your parent and only friend. You are cast out\r\nshelterless on the world: your hopes are blasted; the peace and\r\nsecurity of your pure mind destroyed; memory will bring to you\r\nfrightful images of guilt, and the anguish of innocent love betrayed.\r\nYet I who draw down all this misery upon you; I who cast you forth and\r\nremorselessly have set the seal of distrust and agony on the heart and\r\nbrow of my own child, who with devilish levity have endeavoured to\r\nsteal away her loveliness to place in its stead the foul deformity of\r\nsin; I, in the overflowing anguish of my heart, supplicate you to\r\nforgive me.\r\n\r\n\"I do not ask your pity; you must and do abhor me: but pardon me,\r\nMathilda, and let not your thoughts follow me in my banishment with\r\nunrelenting anger. I must never more behold you; never more hear your\r\nvoice; but the soft whisperings of your forgiveness will reach me and\r\ncool the burning of my disordered brain and heart; I am sure I should\r\nfeel it even in my grave. And I dare enforce this request by relating\r\nhow miserably I was betrayed into this net of fiery anguish and all my\r\nstruggles to release myself: indeed if your soul were less pure and\r\nbright I would not attempt to exculpate myself to you; I should fear\r\nthat if I led you to regard me with less abhorrence you might hate\r\nvice less: but in addressing you I feel as if I appealed to an angelic\r\njudge. I cannot depart without your forgiveness and I must endeavour\r\nto gain it, or I must despair.[35] I conjure you therefore to listen\r\nto my words, and if with the good guilt may be in any degree\r\nextenuated by sharp agony, and remorse that rends the brain as madness\r\nperhaps you may think, though I dare not, that I have some claim to\r\nyour compassion.\r\n\r\n\"I entreat you to call to your remembrance our first happy life on the\r\nshores of Loch Lomond. I had arrived from a weary wandering of sixteen\r\nyears, during which, although I had gone through many dangers and\r\nmisfortunes, my affections had been an entire blank. If I grieved it\r\nwas for your mother, if I loved it was your image; these sole emotions\r\nfilled my heart in quietness. The human creatures around me excited in\r\nme no sympathy and I thought that the mighty change that the death of\r\nyour mother had wrought within me had rendered me callous to any\r\nfuture impression. I saw the lovely and I did not love, I imagined\r\ntherefore that all warmth was extinguished in my heart except that\r\nwhich led me ever to dwell on your then infantine image.\r\n\r\n\"It is a strange link in my fate that without having seen you I should\r\npassionately love you. During my wanderings I never slept without\r\nfirst calling down gentle dreams on your head. If I saw a lovely\r\nwoman, I thought, does my Mathilda resemble her? All delightful\r\nthings, sublime scenery, soft breezes, exquisite music seemed to me\r\nassociated with you and only through you to be pleasant to me. At\r\nlength I saw you. You appeared as the deity of a lovely region, the\r\nministering Angel of a Paradise to which of all human kind you\r\nadmitted only me. I dared hardly consider you as my daughter; your\r\nbeauty, artlessness and untaught wisdom seemed to belong to a higher\r\norder of beings; your voice breathed forth only words of love: if\r\nthere was aught of earthly in you it was only what you derived from\r\nthe beauty of the world; you seemed to have gained a grace from the\r\nmountain breezes--the waterfalls and the lake; and this was all of\r\nearthly except your affections that you had; there was no dross, no\r\nbad feeling in the composition. You yet even have not seen enough[36]\r\nof the world to know the stupendous difference that exists between the\r\nwomen we meet in dayly life and a nymph of the woods such as you were,\r\nin whose eyes alone mankind may study for centuries & grow wiser &\r\npurer. Those divine lights which shone on me as did those of Beatrice\r\nupon Dante, and well might I say with him yet with what different\r\nfeelings\r\n\r\n    E quasi mi perdei gli occhi chini.\r\n\r\nCan you wonder, Mathilda, that I dwelt on your looks, your words, your\r\nmotions, & drank in unmixed delight?\r\n\r\n[\"]But I am afraid that I wander from my purpose. I must be more brief\r\nfor night draws on apace and all my hours in this house are counted.\r\nWell, we removed to London, and still I felt only the peace of sinless\r\npassion. You were ever with me, and I desired no more than to gaze on\r\nyour countenance, and to know that I was all the world to you; I was\r\nlapped in a fool's paradise of enjoyment and security. Was my love\r\nblamable? If it was I was ignorant of it; I desired only that which I\r\npossessed, and if I enjoyed from your looks, and words, and most\r\ninnocent caresses a rapture usually excluded from the feelings of a\r\nparent towards his child, yet no uneasiness, no wish, no casual idea\r\nawoke me to a sense of guilt. I loved you as a human father might be\r\nsupposed to love a daughter borne to him by a heavenly mother; as\r\nAnchises might have regarded the child of Venus if the sex had been\r\nchanged; love mingled with respect and adoration. Perhaps also my\r\npassion was lulled to content by the deep and exclusive affection you\r\nfelt for me.\r\n\r\n\"But when I saw you become the object of another's love; when I\r\nimagined that you might be loved otherwise than as a sacred type and\r\nimage of loveliness and excellence; or that you might love another\r\nwith a more ardent affection than that which you bore to me, then the\r\nfiend awoke within me; I dismissed your lover; and from that moment I\r\nhave known no peace. I have sought in vain for sleep and rest; my lids\r\nrefused to close, and my blood was for ever in a tumult. I awoke to a\r\nnew life as one who dies in hope might wake in Hell. I will not sully\r\nyour imagination by recounting my combats, my self-anger and my\r\ndespair. Let a veil be drawn over the unimaginable sensations of a\r\nguilty father; the secrets of so agonized a heart may not be made\r\nvulgar. All was uproar, crime, remorse and hate, yet still the\r\ntenderest love; and what first awoke me to the firm resolve of\r\nconquering my passion and of restoring her father to my child was the\r\nsight of your bitter and sympathizing sorrows. It was this that led me\r\nhere: I thought that if I could again awaken in my heart the grief I\r\nhad felt at the loss of your mother, and the many associations with\r\nher memory which had been laid to sleep for seventeen years, that all\r\nlove for her child would become extinct. In a fit of heroism I\r\ndetermined to go alone; to quit you, the life of my life, and not to\r\nsee you again untill I might guiltlessly. But it would not do: I rated\r\nmy fortitude too high, or my love too low. I should certainly have\r\ndied if you had not hastened to me. Would that I had been indeed\r\nextinguished!\r\n\r\n\"And now, Mathilda I must make you my last confession. I have been\r\nmiserably mistaken in imagining that I could conquer my love for you;\r\nI never can. The sight of this house, these fields and woods which my\r\nfirst love inhabited seems to have encreased it: in my madness I dared\r\nsay to myself--Diana died to give her birth; her mother's spirit was\r\ntransferred into her frame, and she ought to be as Diana to me.[37]\r\nWith every effort to cast it off, this love clings closer, this guilty\r\nlove more unnatural than hate, that withers your hopes and destroys me\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\n    Better have loved despair, & safer kissed her.\r\n\r\nNo time or space can tear from my soul that which makes a part of it.\r\nSince my arrival here I have not for a moment ceased to feel the hell\r\nof passion which has been implanted in me to burn untill all be cold,\r\nand stiff, and dead. Yet I will not die; alas! how dare I go where I\r\nmay meet Diana, when I have disobeyed her last request; her last words\r\nsaid in a faint voice when all feeling but love, which survives all\r\nthings else was already dead, she then bade me make her child happy:\r\nthat thought alone gives a double sting to death. I will wander away\r\nfrom you, away from all life--in the solitude I shall seek I alone\r\nshall breathe of human kind. I must endure life; and as it is my duty\r\nso I shall untill the grave dreaded yet desired, receive me free from\r\npain: for while I feel it will be pain that must make up the whole sum\r\nof my sensations. Is not this a fearful curse that I labour under? Do\r\nI not look forward to a miserable future? My child, if after this life\r\nI am permitted to see you again, if pain can purify the heart, mine\r\nwill be pure: if remorse may expiate guilt, I shall be guiltless.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[\"]I have been at the door of your chamber: every thing is silent. You\r\nsleep. Do you indeed sleep, Mathilda? Spirits of Good, behold the\r\ntears of my earnest prayer! Bless my child! Protect her from the\r\nselfish among her fellow creatures: protect her from the agonies of\r\npassion, and the despair of disappointment! Peace, Hope and Love be\r\nthy guardians, oh, thou soul of my soul: thou in whom I breathe!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[\"]I dare not read my letter over for I have no time to write another,\r\nand yet I fear that some expressions in it might displease me. Since I\r\nlast saw you I have been constantly employed in writing letters, and\r\nhave several more to write; for I do not intend that any one shall\r\nhear of me after I depart. I need not conjure you to look upon me as\r\none of whom all links that once existed between us are broken. Your\r\nown delicacy will not allow you, I am convinced, to attempt to trace\r\nme. It is far better for your peace that you should be ignorant of my\r\ndestination. You will not follow me, for when I bannish myself would\r\nyou nourish guilt by obtruding yourself upon me? You will not do this,\r\nI know you will not. You must forget me and all the evil that I have\r\ntaught you. Cast off the only gift that I have bestowed upon you, your\r\ngrief, and rise from under my blighting influence as no flower so\r\nsweet ever did rise from beneath so much evil.\r\n\r\n\"You will never hear from me again: receive these then as the last\r\nwords of mine that will ever reach you; and although I have forfeited\r\nyour filial love, yet regard them I conjure you as a father's command.\r\nResolutely shake of[f] the wretchedness that this first misfortune in\r\nearly life must occasion you. Bear boldly up against the storm:\r\ncontinue wise and mild, but believe it, and indeed it is, your duty to\r\nbe happy. You are very young; let not this check for more than a\r\nmoment retard your glorious course; hold on, beloved one. The sun of\r\nyouth is not set for you; it will restore vigour and life to you; do\r\nnot resist with obstinate grief its beneficent influence, oh, my\r\nchild! bless me with the hope that I have not utterly destroyed you.\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, Mathilda. I go with the belief that I have your pardon.\r\nYour gentle nature would not permit you to hate your greatest enemy\r\nand though I be he, although I have rent happiness from your\r\ngrasp;[38] though I have passed over your young love and hopes as the\r\nangel of destruction, finding beauty and joy, and leaving blight and\r\ndespair, yet you will forgive me, and with eyes overflowing with\r\ntears I thank you; my beloved one, I accept your pardon with a\r\ngratitude that will never die, and that will, indeed it will, outlive\r\nguilt and remorse.\r\n\r\n\"Farewell for ever!\"\r\n\r\nThe moment I finished this letter I ordered the carriage and prepared\r\nto follow my father. The words of his letter by which he had dissuaded\r\nme from this step were those that determined me. Why did he write\r\nthem? He must know that if I believed that his intention was merely to\r\nabsent himself from me that instead of opposing him it would be that\r\nwhich I should myself require--or if he thought that any lurking\r\nfeeling, yet he could not think that, should lead me to him would he\r\nendeavour to overthrow the only hope he could have of ever seeing me\r\nagain; a lover, there was madness in the thought, yet he was my lover,\r\nwould not act thus. No, he had determined to die, and he wished to\r\nspare me the misery of knowing it. The few ineffectual words he had\r\nsaid concerning his duty were to me a further proof--and the more I\r\nstudied the letter the more did I perceive a thousand slight\r\nexpressions that could only indicate a knowledge that life was now\r\nover for him. He was about to die! My blood froze at the thought: a\r\nsickening feeling of horror came over me that allowed not of tears. As\r\nI waited for the carriage I walked up and down with a quick pace; then\r\nkneeling and passionately clasping my hands I tried to pray but my\r\nvoice was choked by convulsive sobs--Oh the sun shone[,] the air was\r\nbalmy--he must yet live for if he were dead all would surely be black\r\nas night to me![39]\r\n\r\nThe motion of the carriage knowing that it carried me towards him and\r\nthat I might perhaps find him alive somewhat revived my courage: yet I\r\nhad a dreadful ride. Hope only supported me, the hope that I should\r\nnot be too late[.] I did not weep, but I wiped the perspiration from\r\nmy brow, and tried to still my brain and heart beating almost to\r\nmadness. Oh! I must not be mad when I see him; or perhaps it were as\r\nwell that I should be, my distraction might calm his, and recall him\r\nto the endurance of life. Yet untill I find him I must force reason to\r\nkeep her seat, and I pressed my forehead hard with my hands--Oh do not\r\nleave me; or I shall forget what I am about--instead of driving on as\r\nwe ought with the speed of lightning they will attend to me, and we\r\nshall be too late. Oh! God help me! Let him be alive! It is all dark;\r\nin my abject misery I demand no more: no hope, no good: only passion,\r\nand guilt, and horror; but alive! Alive! My sensations choked me--No\r\ntears fell yet I sobbed, and breathed short and hard; one only thought\r\npossessed me, and I could only utter one word, that half screaming was\r\nperpetually on my lips; Alive! Alive!--\r\n\r\nI had taken the steward[40] with me for he, much better than I[,]\r\ncould make the requisite enquiries--the poor old man could not\r\nrestrain his tears as he saw my deep distress and knew the cause--he\r\nsometimes uttered a few broken words of consolation: in moments like\r\nthese the mistress and servant become in a manner equals and when I\r\nsaw his old dim eyes wet with sympathizing tears; his gray hair thinly\r\nscattered on an age-wrinkled brow I thought oh if my father were as he\r\nis--decrepid & hoary--then I should be spared this pain--\r\n\r\nWhen I had arrived at the nearest town I took post horses and followed\r\nthe road my father had taken. At every inn where we changed horses we\r\nheard of him, and I was possessed by alternate hope and fear. A length\r\nI found that he had altered his route; at first he had followed the\r\nLondon road; but now he changed it, and upon enquiry I found that the\r\none which he now pursued led _towards the sea_. My dream recurred to\r\nmy thoughts; I was not usually superstitious but in wretchedness every\r\none is so. The sea was fifty miles off, yet it was towards it that he\r\nfled. The idea was terrible to my half crazed imagination, and almost\r\nover-turned the little self possession that still remained to me. I\r\njournied all day; every moment my misery encreased and the fever of my\r\nblood became intolerable. The summer sun shone in an unclouded sky;\r\nthe air was close but all was cool to me except my own scorching skin.\r\nTowards evening dark thunder clouds arose above the horrizon and I\r\nheard its distant roll--after sunset they darkened the whole sky and\r\nit began to rain[,] the lightning lighted up the whole country and the\r\nthunder drowned the noise of our carriage. At the next inn my father\r\nhad not taken horses; he had left a box there saying he would return,\r\nand had walked over the fields to the town of ---- a seacost town\r\neight miles off.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I was almost paralized by fear; but my energy returned\r\nand I demanded a guide to accompany me in following his steps. The\r\nnight was tempestuous but my bribe was high and I easily procured a\r\ncountryman. We passed through many lanes and over fields and wild\r\ndowns; the rain poured down in torrents; and the loud thunder broke in\r\nterrible crashes over our heads. Oh! What a night it was! And I passed\r\non with quick steps among the high, dank grass amid the rain and\r\ntempest. My dream was for ever in my thoughts, and with a kind of half\r\ninsanity that often possesses the mind in despair, I said aloud;\r\n\"Courage! We are not near the sea; we are yet several miles from the\r\nocean\"--Yet it was towards the sea that our direction lay and that\r\nheightened the confusion of my ideas. Once, overcome by fatigue, I\r\nsunk on the wet earth; about two hundred yards distant, alone in a\r\nlarge meadow stood a magnificent oak; the lightnings shewed its myriad\r\nboughs torn by the storm. A strange idea seized me; a person must have\r\nfelt all the agonies of doubt concerning the life and death of one who\r\nis the whole world to them before they can enter into my feelings--for\r\nin that state, the mind working unrestrained by the will makes strange\r\nand fanciful combinations with outward circumstances and weaves the\r\nchances and changes of nature into an immediate connexion with the\r\nevent they dread. It was with this feeling that I turned to the old\r\nSteward who stood pale and trembling beside me; \"Mark, Gaspar, if the\r\nnext flash of lightning rend not that oak my father will be alive.\"\r\n\r\nI had scarcely uttered these words than a flash instantly followed by\r\na tremendous peal of thunder descended on it; and when my eyes\r\nrecovered their sight after the dazzling light, the oak no longer\r\nstood in the meadow--The old man uttered a wild exclamation of horror\r\nwhen he saw so sudden an interpretation given to my prophesy. I\r\nstarted up, my strength returned; [_sic_] with my terror; I cried,\r\n\"Oh, God! Is this thy decree? Yet perhaps I shall not be too late.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough still several miles distant we continued to approach the sea.\r\nWe came at last to the road that led to the town of----and at an inn\r\nthere we heard that my father had passed by somewhat before sunset; he\r\nhad observed the approaching storm and had hired a horse for the next\r\ntown which was situated a mile from the sea that he might arrive there\r\nbefore it should commence: this town was five miles off. We hired a\r\nchaise here, and with four horses drove with speed through the storm.\r\nMy garments were wet and clung around me, and my hair hung in straight\r\nlocks on my neck when not blown aside by the wind. I shivered, yet my\r\npulse was high with fever. Great God! What agony I endured. I shed no\r\ntears but my eyes wild and inflamed were starting from my head; I\r\ncould hardly support the weight that pressed upon my brain. We arrived\r\nat the town of ---- in a little more than half an hour. When my father\r\nhad arrived the storm had already begun, but he had refused to stop\r\nand leaving his horse there he walked on--_towards the sea_. Alas! it\r\nwas double cruelty in him to have chosen the sea for his fatal\r\nresolve; it was adding madness to my despair.[41]\r\n\r\nThe poor old servant who was with me endeavoured to persuade me to\r\nremain here and to let him go alone--I shook my head silently and\r\nsadly; sick almost to death I leant upon his arm, and as there was no\r\nroad for a chaise dragged my weary steps across the desolate downs to\r\nmeet my fate, now too certain for the agony of doubt. Almost fainting\r\nI slowly approached the fatal waters; when we had quitted the town we\r\nheard their roaring[.] I whispered to myself in a muttering\r\nvoice--\"The sound is the same as that which I heard in my dream. It is\r\nthe knell of my father which I hear.\"[42]\r\n\r\nThe rain had ceased; there was no more thunder and lightning; the wind\r\nhad paused. My heart no longer beat wildly; I did not feel any fever:\r\nbut I was chilled; my knees sunk under me--I almost slept as I walked\r\nwith excess of weariness; every limb trembled. I was silent: all was\r\nsilent except the roaring of the sea which became louder and more\r\ndreadful. Yet we advanced slowly: sometimes I thought that we should\r\nnever arrive; that the sound of waves would still allure us, and that\r\nwe should walk on for ever and ever: field succeeding field, never\r\nwould our weary journey cease, nor night nor day; but still we should\r\nhear the dashing of the sea, and to all this there would be no end.\r\nWild beyond the imagination of the happy are the thoughts bred by\r\nmisery and despair.\r\n\r\nAt length we reached the overhanging beach; a cottage stood beside the\r\npath; we knocked at the door and it was opened: the bed within\r\ninstantly caught my eye; something stiff and straight lay on it,\r\ncovered by a sheet; the cottagers looked aghast. The first words that\r\nthey uttered confirmed what I before knew. I did not feel shocked or\r\novercome: I believe that I asked one or two questions and listened to\r\nthe answers. I har[d]ly know, but in a few moments I sank lifeless to\r\nthe ground; and so would that then all had been at an end!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nI was carried to the next town: fever succeeded to convulsions and\r\nfaintings, & for some weeks my unhappy spirit hovered on the very\r\nverge of death. But life was yet strong within me; I recovered: nor\r\ndid it a little aid my returning health that my recollections were at\r\nfirst vague, and that I was too weak to feel any violent emotion. I\r\noften said to myself, my father is dead. He loved me with a guilty\r\npassion, and stung by remorse and despair he killed himself. Why is it\r\nthat I feel no horror? Are these circumstances not dreadful? Is it not\r\nenough that I shall never more meet the eyes of my beloved father;\r\nnever more hear his voice; no caress, no look? All cold, and stiff,\r\nand dead! Alas! I am quite callous: the night I was out in was fearful\r\nand the cold rain that fell about my heart has acted like the waters\r\nof the cavern of Antiparos[43] and has changed it to stone. I do not\r\nweep or sigh; but I must reason with myself, and force myself to feel\r\nsorrow and despair. This is not resignation that I feel, for I am dead\r\nto all regret.\r\n\r\nI communed in this manner with myself, but I was silent to all around\r\nme. I hardly replied to the slightest question, and was uneasy when I\r\nsaw a human creature near me. I was surrounded by my female relations,\r\nbut they were all of them nearly strangers to me: I did not listen to\r\ntheir consolations; and so little did they work their designed effect\r\nthat they seemed to me to be spoken in an unknown tongue. I found if\r\nsorrow was dead within me, so was love and desire of sympathy. Yet\r\nsorrow only slept to revive more fierce, but love never woke\r\nagain--its ghost, ever hovering over my father's grave, alone\r\nsurvived--since his death all the world was to me a blank except where\r\nwoe had stampt its burning words telling me to smile no more--the\r\nliving were not fit companions for me, and I was ever meditating by\r\nwhat means I might shake them all off, and never be heard of again.\r\n\r\nMy convalescence rapidly advanced, yet this was the thought that\r\nhaunted me, and I was for ever forming plans how I might hereafter\r\ncontrive to escape the tortures that were prepared for me when I\r\nshould mix in society, and to find that solitude which alone could\r\nsuit one whom an untold grief seperated from her fellow creatures.\r\nWho can be more solitary even in a crowd than one whose history and\r\nthe never ending feelings and remembrances arising from it is [_sic_]\r\nknown to no living soul. There was too deep a horror in my tale for\r\nconfidence; I was on earth the sole depository of my own secret. I\r\nmight tell it to the winds and to the desart heaths but I must never\r\namong my fellow creatures, either by word or look give allowance to\r\nthe smallest conjecture of the dread reality: I must shrink before the\r\neye of man lest he should read my father's guilt in my glazed eyes: I\r\nmust be silent lest my faltering voice should betray unimagined\r\nhorrors. Over the deep grave of my secret I must heap an impenetrable\r\nheap of false smiles and words: cunning frauds, treacherous laughter\r\nand a mixture of all light deceits would form a mist to blind others\r\nand be as the poisonous simoon to me.[44] I, the offspring of love,\r\nthe child of the woods, the nursling of Nature's bright self was to\r\nsubmit to this? I dared not.\r\n\r\nHow must I escape? I was rich and young, and had a guardian appointed\r\nfor me; and all about me would act as if I were one of their great\r\nsociety, while I must keep the secret that I really was cut off from\r\nthem for ever. If I fled I should be pursued; in life there was no\r\nescape for me: why then I must die. I shuddered; I dared not die even\r\nthough the cold grave held all I loved; although I might say with Job\r\n\r\n    Where is now my hope? For my hope who shall see it?\r\n\r\n    They shall go down together to the bars of the pit, when our\r\n    rest together is in the dust--[45]\r\n\r\nYes my hope was corruption and dust and all to which death brings\r\nus.--Or after life--No, no, I will not persuade myself to die, I may\r\nnot, dare not. And then I wept; yes, warm tears once more struggled\r\ninto my eyes soothing yet bitter; and after I had wept much and called\r\nwith unavailing anguish, with outstretched arms, for my cruel father;\r\nafter my weak frame was exhausted by all variety of plaint I sank once\r\nmore into reverie, and once more reflected on how I might find that\r\nwhich I most desired; dear to me if aught were dear, a death-like\r\nsolitude.\r\n\r\nI dared not die, but I might feign death, and thus escape from my\r\ncomforters: they will believe me united to my father, and so indeed I\r\nshall be. For alone, when no voice can disturb my dream, and no cold\r\neye meet mine to check its fire, then I may commune with his spirit;\r\non a lone heath, at noon or at midnight, still I should be near him.\r\nHis last injunction to me was that I should be happy; perhaps he did\r\nnot mean the shadowy happiness that I promised myself, yet it was that\r\nalone which I could taste. He did not conceive that ever [qu.\r\n_never_?] again I could make one of the smiling hunters that go\r\ncoursing after bubles that break to nothing when caught, and then\r\nafter a new one with brighter colours; my hope also had proved a\r\nbuble, but it had been so lovely, so adorned that I saw none that\r\ncould attract me after it; besides I was wearied with the pursuit,\r\nnearly dead with weariness.\r\n\r\nI would feign to die; my contented heirs would seize upon my wealth,\r\nand I should purchase freedom. But then my plan must be laid with art;\r\nI would not be left destitute, I must secure some money. Alas! to what\r\nloathsome shifts must I be driven? Yet a whole life of falsehood was\r\notherwise my portion: and when remorse at being the contriver of any\r\ncheat made me shrink from my design I was irresistably led back and\r\nconfirmed in it by the visit of some aunt or cousin, who would tell me\r\nthat death was the end of all men. And then say that my father had\r\nsurely lost his wits ever since my mother's death; that he was mad and\r\nthat I was fortunate, for in one of his fits he might have killed me\r\ninstead of destroying his own crazed being. And all this, to be sure,\r\nwas delicately put; not in broad words for my feelings might be hurt\r\nbut\r\n\r\n    Whispered so and so\r\n    In dark hint soft and low[E][46]\r\n\r\nwith downcast eyes, and sympathizing smiles or whimpers; and I\r\nlistened with quiet countenance while every nerve trembled; I that\r\ndared not utter aye or no to all this blasphemy. Oh, this was a\r\ndelicious life quite void of guile! I with my dove's look and fox's\r\nheart: for indeed I felt only the degradation of falsehood, and not\r\nany sacred sentiment of conscious innocence that might redeem it. I\r\nwho had before clothed myself in the bright garb of sincerity must now\r\nborrow one of divers colours: it might sit awkwardly at first, but use\r\nwould enable me to place it in elegant folds, to lie with grace. Aye,\r\nI might die my soul with falsehood untill I had quite hid its native\r\ncolour. Oh, beloved father! Accept the pure heart of your unhappy\r\ndaughter; permit me to join you unspotted as I was or you will not\r\nrecognize my altered semblance. As grief might change Constance[47] so\r\nwould deceit change me untill in heaven you would say, \"This is not my\r\nchild\"--My father, to be happy both now and when again we meet I must\r\nfly from all this life which is mockery to one like me. In solitude\r\nonly shall I be myself; in solitude I shall be thine.\r\n\r\nAlas! I even now look back with disgust at my artifices and\r\ncontrivances by which, after many painful struggles, I effected my\r\nretreat. I might enter into a long detail of the means I used, first\r\nto secure myself a slight maintenance for the remainder of my life,\r\nand afterwards to ensure the conviction of my death: I might, but I\r\nwill not. I even now blush at the falsehoods I uttered; my heart\r\nsickens: I will leave this complication of what I hope I may in a\r\nmanner call innocent deceit to be imagined by the reader. The\r\nremembrance haunts me like a crime--I know that if I were to endeavour\r\nto relate it my tale would at length remain unfinished.[48] I was led\r\nto London, and had to endure for some weeks cold looks, cold words and\r\ncolder consolations: but I escaped; they tried to bind me with fetters\r\nthat they thought silken, yet which weighed on me like iron, although\r\nI broke them more easily than a girth formed of a single straw and\r\nfled to freedom.\r\n\r\nThe few weeks that I spent in London were the most miserable of my\r\nlife: a great city is a frightful habitation to one sorrowing. The\r\nsunset and the gentle moon, the blessed motion of the leaves and the\r\nmurmuring of waters are all sweet physicians to a distempered mind.\r\nThe soul is expanded and drinks in quiet, a lulling medecine--to me it\r\nwas as the sight of the lovely water snakes to the bewitched\r\nmariner--in loving and blessing Nature I unawares, called down a\r\nblessing on my own soul. But in a city all is closed shut like a\r\nprison, a wiry prison from which you can peep at the sky only. I can\r\nnot describe to you what were [_sic_] the frantic nature of my\r\nsensations while I resided there; I was often on the verge of madness.\r\nNay, when I look back on many of my wild thoughts, thoughts with which\r\nactions sometimes endeavoured to keep pace; when I tossed my hands\r\nhigh calling down the cope of heaven to fall on me and bury me; when I\r\ntore my hair and throwing it to the winds cried, \"Ye are free, go seek\r\nmy father!\" And then, like the unfortunate Constance, catching at\r\nthem again and tying them up, that nought might find him if I might\r\nnot. How, on my knees I have fancied myself close to my father's grave\r\nand struck the ground in anger that it should cover him from me. Oft\r\nwhen I have listened with gasping attention for the sound of the ocean\r\nmingled with my father's groans; and then wept untill my strength was\r\ngone and I was calm and faint, when I have recollected all this I have\r\nasked myself if this were not madness. While in London these and many\r\nother dreadful thoughts too harrowing for words were my portion: I\r\nlost all this suffering when I was free; when I saw the wild heath\r\naround me, and the evening star in the west, then I could weep, gently\r\nweep, and be at peace.\r\n\r\nDo not mistake me; I never was really mad. I was always conscious of\r\nmy state when my wild thoughts seemed to drive me to insanity, and\r\nnever betrayed them to aught but silence and solitude. The people\r\naround me saw nothing of all this. They only saw a poor girl broken in\r\nspirit, who spoke in a low and gentle voice, and from underneath whose\r\ndowncast lids tears would sometimes steal which she strove to hide.\r\nOne who loved to be alone, and shrunk from observation; who never\r\nsmiled; oh, no! I never smiled--and that was all.\r\n\r\nWell, I escaped. I left my guardian's house and I was never heard of\r\nagain; it was believed from the letters that I left and other\r\ncircumstances that I planned that I had destroyed myself. I was sought\r\nafter therefore with less care than would otherwise have been the\r\ncase; and soon all trace and memory of me was lost. I left London in a\r\nsmall vessel bound for a port in the north of England. And now having\r\nsucceeded in my attempt, and being quite alone peace returned to me.\r\nThe sea was calm and the vessel moved gently onwards, I sat upon deck\r\nunder the open canopy of heaven and methought I was an altered\r\ncreature. Not the wild, raving & most miserable Mathilda but a\r\nyouthful Hermitess dedicated to seclusion and whose bosom she must\r\nstrive to keep free from all tumult and unholy despair--The fanciful\r\nnunlike dress that I had adopted;[49] the knowledge that my very\r\nexistence was a secret known only to myself; the solitude to which I\r\nwas for ever hereafter destined nursed gentle thoughts in my wounded\r\nheart. The breeze that played in my hair revived me, and I watched\r\nwith quiet eyes the sunbeams that glittered on the waves, and the\r\nbirds that coursed each other over the waters just brushing them with\r\ntheir plumes. I slept too undisturbed by dreams; and awoke refreshed\r\nto again enjoy my tranquil freedom.\r\n\r\nIn four days we arrived at the harbour to which we were bound. I would\r\nnot remain on the sea coast, but proceeded immediately inland. I had\r\nalready planned the situation where I would live. It should be a\r\nsolitary house on a wide plain near no other habitation: where I could\r\nbehold the whole horizon, and wander far without molestation from the\r\nsight of my fellow creatures. I was not mysanthropic, but I felt that\r\nthe gentle current of my feelings depended upon my being alone. I\r\nfixed myself on a wide solitude. On a dreary heath bestrewen with\r\nstones, among which short grass grew; and here and there a few rushes\r\nbeside a little pool. Not far from my cottage was a small cluster of\r\npines the only trees to be seen for many miles: I had a path cut\r\nthrough the furze from my door to this little wood, from whose topmost\r\nbranches the birds saluted the rising sun and awoke me to my daily\r\nmeditation. My view was bounded only by the horizon except on one side\r\nwhere a distant wood made a black spot on the heath, that every where\r\nelse stretched out its faint hues as far as the eye could reach, wide\r\nand very desolate. Here I could mark the net work of the clouds as\r\nthey wove themselves into thick masses: I could watch the slow rise of\r\nthe heavy thunder clouds and could see the rack as it was driven\r\nacross the heavens, or under the pine trees I could enjoy the\r\nstillness of the azure sky.\r\n\r\nMy life was very peaceful. I had one female servant who spent the\r\ngreater part of the day at a village two miles off. My amusements were\r\nsimple and very innocent; I fed the birds who built on the pines or\r\namong the ivy that covered the wall of my little garden, and they soon\r\nknew me: the bolder ones pecked the crumbs from my hands and perched\r\non my fingers to sing their thankfulness. When I had lived here some\r\ntime other animals visited me and a fox came every day for a portion\r\nof food appropriated for him & would suffer me to pat his head. I had\r\nbesides many books and a harp with which when despairing I could\r\nsoothe my spirits, and raise myself to sympathy and love.\r\n\r\nLove! What had I to love? Oh many things: there was the moonshine, and\r\nthe bright stars; the breezes and the refreshing rains; there was the\r\nwhole earth and the sky that covers it: all lovely forms that visited\r\nmy imagination[,] all memories of heroism and virtue. Yet this was\r\nvery unlike my early life although as then I was confined to Nature\r\nand books. Then I bounded across the fields; my spirit often seemed to\r\nride upon the winds, and to mingle in joyful sympathy with the ambient\r\nair. Then if I wandered slowly I cheered myself with a sweet song or\r\nsweeter day dreams. I felt a holy rapture spring from all I saw. I\r\ndrank in joy with life; my steps were light; my eyes, clear from the\r\nlove that animated them, sought the heavens, and with my long hair\r\nloosened to the winds I gave my body and my mind to sympathy and\r\ndelight. But now my walk was slow--My eyes were seldom raised and\r\noften filled with tears; no song; no smiles; no careless motion that\r\nmight bespeak a mind intent on what surrounded it--I was gathered up\r\ninto myself--a selfish solitary creature ever pondering on my regrets\r\nand faded hopes.\r\n\r\nMine was an idle, useless life; it was so; but say not to the lily\r\nlaid prostrate by the storm arise, and bloom as before. My heart was\r\nbleeding from its death's wound; I could live no otherwise--Often amid\r\napparent calm I was visited by despair and melancholy; gloom that\r\nnought could dissipate or overcome; a hatred of life; a carelessness\r\nof beauty; all these would by fits hold me nearly annihilated by their\r\npowers. Never for one moment when most placid did I cease to pray for\r\ndeath. I could be found in no state of mind which I would not\r\nwillingly have exchanged for nothingness. And morning and evening my\r\ntearful eyes raised to heaven, my hands clasped tight in the energy of\r\nprayer, I have repeated with the poet--\r\n\r\n    Before I see another day\r\n    Oh, let this body die away!\r\n\r\nLet me not be reproached then with inutility; I believed that by\r\nsuicide I should violate a divine law of nature, and I thought that I\r\nsufficiently fulfilled my part in submitting to the hard task of\r\nenduring the crawling hours & minutes[50]--in bearing the load of time\r\nthat weighed miserably upon me and that in abstaining from what I in\r\nmy calm moments considered a crime, I deserved the reward of virtue.\r\nThere were periods, dreadful ones, during which I despaired--& doubted\r\nthe existence of all duty & the reality of crime--but I shudder, and\r\nturn from the rememberance.\r\n\r\n\r\n[E] Coleridge's Fire, Famine and Slaughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nThus I passed two years. Day after day so many hundreds wore on; they\r\nbrought no outward changes with them, but some few slowly operated on\r\nmy mind as I glided on towards death. I began to study more; to\r\nsympathize more in the thoughts of others as expressed in books; to\r\nread history, and to lose my individuallity among the crowd that had\r\nexisted before me. Thus perhaps as the sensation of immediate\r\nsuffering wore off, I became more human. Solitude also lost to me some\r\nof its charms: I began again to wish for sympathy; not that I was ever\r\ntempted to seek the crowd, but I wished for one friend to love me. You\r\nwill say perhaps that I gradually became fitted to return to society.\r\nI do not think so. For the sympathy that I desired must be so pure, so\r\ndivested of influence from outward circumstances that in the world I\r\ncould not fail of being balked by the gross materials that perpetually\r\nmingle even with its best feelings. Believe me, I was then less fitted\r\nfor any communion with my fellow creatures than before. When I left\r\nthem they had tormented me but it was in the same way as pain and\r\nsickness may torment; somthing extraneous to the mind that galled it,\r\nand that I wished to cast aside. But now I should have desired\r\nsympathy; I should wish to knit my soul to some one of theirs, and\r\nshould have prepared for myself plentiful draughts of disappointment\r\nand suffering; for I was tender as the sensitive plant, all nerve. I\r\ndid not desire sympathy and aid in ambition or wisdom, but sweet and\r\nmutual affection; smiles to cheer me and gentle words of comfort. I\r\nwished for one heart in which I could pour unrestrained my plaints,\r\nand by the heavenly nature of the soil blessed fruit might spring from\r\nsuch bad seed. Yet how could I find this? The love that is the soul of\r\nfriendship is a soft spirit seldom found except when two amiable\r\ncreatures are knit from early youth, or when bound by mutual suffering\r\nand pursuits; it comes to some of the elect unsought and unaware; it\r\ndescends as gentle dew on chosen spots which however barren they were\r\nbefore become under its benign influence fertile in all sweet plants;\r\nbut when desired it flies; it scoffs at the prayers of its votaries;\r\nit will bestow, but not be sought.\r\n\r\nI knew all this and did not go to seek sympathy; but there on my\r\nsolitary heath, under my lowly roof where all around was desart, it\r\ncame to me as a sun beam in winter to adorn while it helps to dissolve\r\nthe drifted snow.--Alas the sun shone on blighted fruit; I did not\r\nrevive under its radiance for I was too utterly undone to feel its\r\nkindly power. My father had been and his memory was the life of my\r\nlife. I might feel gratitude to another but I never more could love or\r\nhope as I had done; it was all suffering; even my pleasures were\r\nendured, not enjoyed. I was as a solitary spot among mountains shut in\r\non all sides by steep black precipices; where no ray of heat could\r\npenetrate; and from which there was no outlet to sunnier fields. And\r\nthus it was that although the spirit of friendship soothed me for a\r\nwhile it could not restore me. It came as some gentle visitation; it\r\nwent and I hardly felt the loss. The spirit of existence was dead\r\nwithin me; be not surprised therefore that when it came I welcomed not\r\nmore gladly, or when it departed I lamented not more bitterly the best\r\ngift of heaven--a friend.\r\n\r\nThe name of my friend was Woodville.[51] I will briefly relate his\r\nhistory that you may judge how cold my heart must have been not to be\r\nwarmed by his eloquent words and tender sympathy; and how he also\r\nbeing most unhappy we were well fitted to be a mutual consolation to\r\neach other, if I had not been hardened to stone by the Medusa head of\r\nMisery. The misfortunes of Woodville were not of the hearts core like\r\nmine; his was a natural grief, not to destroy but to purify the heart\r\nand from which he might, when its shadow had passed from over him,\r\nshine forth brighter and happier than before.\r\n\r\nWoodville was the son of a poor clergyman and had received a classical\r\neducation. He was one of those very few whom fortune favours from\r\ntheir birth; on whom she bestows all gifts of intellect and person\r\nwith a profusion that knew no bounds, and whom under her peculiar\r\nprotection, no imperfection however slight, or disappointment however\r\ntransitory has leave to touch. She seemed to have formed his mind of\r\nthat excellence which no dross can tarnish, and his understanding was\r\nsuch that no error could pervert. His genius was transcendant, and\r\nwhen it rose as a bright star in the east all eyes were turned towards\r\nit in admiration. He was a Poet. That name has so often been degraded\r\nthat it will not convey the idea of all that he was. He was like a\r\npoet of old whom the muses had crowned in his cradle, and on whose\r\nlips bees had fed. As he walked among other men he seemed encompassed\r\nwith a heavenly halo that divided him from and lifted him above them.\r\nIt was his surpassing beauty, the dazzling fire of his eyes, and his\r\nwords whose rich accents wrapt the listener in mute and extactic\r\nwonder, that made him transcend all others so that before him they\r\nappeared only formed to minister to his superior excellence.\r\n\r\nHe was glorious from his youth. Every one loved him; no shadow of envy\r\nor hate cast even from the meanest mind ever fell upon him. He was, as\r\none the peculiar delight of the Gods, railed and fenced in by his own\r\ndivinity, so that nought but love and admiration could approach him.\r\nHis heart was simple like a child, unstained by arrogance or vanity.\r\nHe mingled in society unknowing of his superiority over his\r\ncompanions, not because he undervalued himself but because he did not\r\nperceive the inferiority of others. He seemed incapable of conceiving\r\nof the full extent of the power that selfishness & vice possesses in\r\nthe world: when I knew him, although he had suffered disappointment in\r\nhis dearest hopes, he had not experienced any that arose from the\r\nmeaness and self love of men: his station was too high to allow of his\r\nsuffering through their hardheartedness; and too low for him to have\r\nexperienced ingratitude and encroaching selfishness: it is one of the\r\nblessings of a moderate fortune, that by preventing the possessor from\r\nconfering pecuniary favours it prevents him also from diving into the\r\narcana of human weakness or malice--To bestow on your fellow men is a\r\nGodlike attribute--So indeed it is and as such not one fit for\r\nmortality;--the giver like Adam and Prometheus, must pay the penalty\r\nof rising above his nature by being the martyr to his own excellence.\r\nWoodville was free from all these evils; and if slight examples did\r\ncome across him[52] he did not notice them but passed on in his course\r\nas an angel with winged feet might glide along the earth unimpeded by\r\nall those little obstacles over which we of earthly origin stumble. He\r\nwas a believer in the divinity of genius and always opposed a stern\r\ndisbelief to the objections of those petty cavillers and minor critics\r\nwho wish to reduce all men to their own miserable level--\"I will make\r\na scientific simile\" he would say, \"[i]n the manner, if you will, of\r\nDr. Darwin--I consider the alledged errors of a man of genius as the\r\naberrations of the fixed stars. It is our distance from them and our\r\nimperfect means of communication that makes them appear to move; in\r\ntruth they always remain stationary, a glorious centre, giving us a\r\nfine lesson of modesty if we would thus receive it.\"[53]\r\n\r\nI have said that he was a poet: when he was three and twenty years of\r\nage he first published a poem, and it was hailed by the whole nation\r\nwith enthusiasm and delight. His good star perpetually shone upon him;\r\na reputation had never before been made so rapidly: it was universal.\r\nThe multitude extolled the same poems that formed the wonder of the\r\nsage in his closet: there was not one dissentient voice.[54]\r\n\r\nIt was at this time, in the height of his glory, that he became\r\nacquainted with Elinor. She was a young heiress of exquisite beauty\r\nwho lived under the care of her guardian: from the moment they were\r\nseen together they appeared formed for each other. Elinor had not the\r\ngenius of Woodville but she was generous and noble, and exalted by her\r\nyouth and the love that she every where excited above the knowledge of\r\naught but virtue and excellence. She was lovely; her manners were\r\nfrank and simple; her deep blue eyes swam in a lustre which could only\r\nbe given by sensibility joined to wisdom.\r\n\r\nThey were formed for one another and they soon loved. Woodville for\r\nthe first time felt the delight of love; and Elinor was enraptured in\r\npossessing the heart of one so beautiful and glorious among his fellow\r\nmen. Could any thing but unmixed joy flow from such a union?\r\n\r\nWoodville was a Poet--he was sought for by every society and all eyes\r\nwere turned on him alone when he appeared; but he was the son of a\r\npoor clergyman and Elinor was a rich heiress. Her guardian was not\r\ndispleased with their mutual affection: the merit of Woodville was too\r\neminent to admit of cavil on account of his inferior wealth; but the\r\ndying will of her father did not allow her to marry before she was of\r\nage and her fortune depended upon her obeying this injunction. She had\r\njust entered her twentieth year, and she and her lover were obliged to\r\nsubmit to this delay. But they were ever together and their happiness\r\nseemed that of Paradise: they studied together: formed plans of future\r\noccupations, and drinking in love and joy from each other's eyes and\r\nwords they hardly repined at the delay to their entire union.\r\nWoodville for ever rose in glory; and Elinor become more lovely and\r\nwise under the lessons of her accomplished lover.\r\n\r\nIn two months Elinor would be twenty one: every thing was prepared for\r\ntheir union. How shall I relate the catastrophe to so much joy; but\r\nthe earth would not be the earth it is covered with blight and sorrow\r\nif one such pair as these angelic creatures had been suffered to exist\r\nfor one another: search through the world and you will not find the\r\nperfect happiness which their marriage would have caused them to\r\nenjoy; there must have been a revolution in the order of things as\r\nestablished among us miserable earth-dwellers to have admitted of such\r\nconsummate joy. The chain of necessity ever bringing misery must have\r\nbeen broken and the malignant fate that presides over it would not\r\npermit this breach of her eternal laws. But why should I repine at\r\nthis? Misery was my element, and nothing but what was miserable could\r\napproach me; if Woodville had been happy I should never have known\r\nhim. And can I who for many years was fed by tears, and nourished\r\nunder the dew of grief, can I pause to relate a tale of woe and\r\ndeath?[55]\r\n\r\nWoodville was obliged to make a journey into the country and was\r\ndetained from day to day in irksome absence from his lovely bride. He\r\nreceived a letter from her to say that she was slightly ill, but\r\ntelling him to hasten to her, that from his eyes she would receive\r\nhealth and that his company would be her surest medecine. He was\r\ndetained three days longer and then he hastened to her. His heart, he\r\nknew not why prognosticated misfortune; he had not heard from her\r\nagain; he feared she might be worse and this fear made him impatient\r\nand restless for the moment of beholding her once more stand before\r\nhim arrayed in health and beauty; for a sinister voice seemed always\r\nto whisper to him, \"You will never more behold her as she was.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at her habitation all was silent in it: he made his\r\nway through several rooms; in one he saw a servant weeping bitterly:\r\nhe was faint with fear and could hardly ask, \"Is she dead?\" and just\r\nlistened to the dreadful answer, \"Not yet.\" These astounding words\r\ncame on him as of less fearful import than those which he had\r\nexpected; and to learn that she was still in being, and that he might\r\nstill hope was an alleviation to him. He remembered the words of her\r\nletter and he indulged the wild idea that his kisses breathing warm\r\nlove and life would infuse new spirit into her, and that with him near\r\nher she could not die; that his presence was the talisman of her life.\r\n\r\nHe hastened to her sick room; she lay, her cheeks burning with fever,\r\nyet her eyes were closed and she was seemingly senseless. He wrapt her\r\nin his arms; he imprinted breathless kisses on her burning lips; he\r\ncalled to her in a voice of subdued anguish by the tenderest names;\r\n\"Return Elinor; I am with you; your life, your love. Return; dearest\r\none, you promised me this boon, that I should bring you health. Let\r\nyour sweet spirit revive; you cannot die near me: What is death? To\r\nsee you no more? To part with what is a part of myself; without whom I\r\nhave no memory and no futurity? Elinor die! This is frenzy and the\r\nmost miserable despair: you cannot die while I am near.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again he kissed her eyes and lips, and hung over her inanimate\r\nform in agony, gazing on her countenance still lovely although\r\nchanged, watching every slight convulsion, and varying colour which\r\ndenoted life still lingering although about to depart. Once for a\r\nmoment she revived and recognized his voice; a smile, a last lovely\r\nsmile, played upon her lips. He watched beside her for twelve hours\r\nand then she died.[56]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was six months after this miserable conclusion to his long nursed\r\nhopes that I first saw him. He had retired to a part of the country\r\nwhere he was not known that he might peacefully indulge his grief. All\r\nthe world, by the death of his beloved Elinor, was changed to him, and\r\nhe could no longer remain in any spot where he had seen her or where\r\nher image mingled with the most rapturous hopes had brightened all\r\naround with a light of joy which would now be transformed to a\r\ndarkness blacker than midnight since she, the sun of his life, was set\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\nHe lived for some time never looking on the light of heaven but\r\nshrouding his eyes in a perpetual darkness far from all that could\r\nremind him of what he had been; but as time softened his grief[57]\r\nlike a true child of Nature he sought in the enjoyment of her beauties\r\nfor a consolation in his unhappiness. He came to a part of the country\r\nwhere he was entirely unknown and where in the deepest solitude he\r\ncould converse only with his own heart. He found a relief to his\r\nimpatient grief in the breezes of heaven and in the sound of waters\r\nand woods. He became fond of riding; this exercise distracted his mind\r\nand elevated his spirits; on a swift horse he could for a moment gain\r\nrespite from the image that else for ever followed him; Elinor on her\r\ndeath bed, her sweet features changed, and the soft spirit that\r\nanimated her gradually waning into extinction. For many months\r\nWoodville had in vain endeavoured to cast off this terrible\r\nremembrance; it still hung on him untill memory was too great a\r\nburthen for his loaded soul, but when on horseback the spell that\r\nseemingly held him to this idea was snapt; then if he thought of his\r\nlost bride he pictured her radiant in beauty; he could hear her voice,\r\nand fancy her \"a sylvan Huntress by his side,\" while his eyes\r\nbrightened as he thought he gazed on her cherished form. I had several\r\ntimes seen him ride across the heath and felt angry that my solitude\r\nshould be disturbed. It was so long [since] I had spoken to any but\r\npeasants that I felt a disagreable sensation at being gazed on by one\r\nof superior rank. I feared also that it might be some one who had seen\r\nme before: I might be recognized, my impostures discovered and I\r\ndragged back to a life of worse torture than that I had before\r\nendured. These were dreadful fears and they even haunted my\r\ndreams.[58]\r\n\r\nI was one day seated on the verge of the clump of pines when Woodville\r\nrode past. As soon as I perceived him I suddenly rose to escape from\r\nhis observation by entering among the trees. My rising startled his\r\nhorse; he reared and plunged and the Rider was at length thrown. The\r\nhorse then galopped swiftly across the heath and the stranger remained\r\non the ground stunned by his fall. He was not materially hurt, a\r\nlittle fresh water soon recovered him. I was struck by his exceeding\r\nbeauty, and as he spoke to thank me the sweet but melancholy cadence\r\nof his voice brought tears into my eyes.\r\n\r\nA short conversation passed between us, but the next day he again\r\nstopped at my cottage and by degrees an intimacy grew between us. It\r\nwas strange to him to see a female in extreme youth, I was not yet\r\ntwenty, evidently belonging to the first classes of society &\r\npossessing every accomplishment an excellent education could bestow,\r\nliving alone on a desolate health [_sic_]--One on whose forehead the\r\nimpress of grief was strongly marked, and whose words and motions\r\nbetrayed that her thoughts did not follow them but were intent on far\r\nother ideas; bitter and overwhelming miseries. I was dressed also in a\r\nwhimsical nunlike habit which denoted that I did not retire to\r\nsolitude from necessity, but that I might indulge in a luxury of\r\ngrief, and fanciful seclusion.\r\n\r\nHe soon took great interest in me, and sometimes forgot his own grief\r\nto sit beside me and endeavour to cheer me. He could not fail to\r\ninterest even one who had shut herself from the whole world, whose\r\nhope was death, and who lived only with the departed. His personal\r\nbeauty; his conversation which glowed with imagination and\r\nsensibility; the poetry that seemed to hang upon his lips and to make\r\nthe very air mute to listen to him were charms that no one could\r\nresist. He was younger, less worn, more passionless than my father and\r\nin no degree reminded me of him: he suffered under immediate grief yet\r\nits gentle influence instead of calling feelings otherwise dormant\r\ninto action, seemed only to veil that which otherwise would have been\r\ntoo dazzling for me. When we were together I spoke little yet my\r\nselfish mind was sometimes borne away by the rapid course of his\r\nideas; I would lift my eyes with momentary brilliancy until memories\r\nthat never died and seldom slept would recur, and a tear would dim\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWoodville for ever tried to lead me to the contemplation of what is\r\nbeautiful and happy in the world.[59] His own mind was constitunially\r\n[_sic_] bent to a former belief in good [rather] than in evil and this\r\nfeeling which must even exhilirate the hopeless ever shone forth in\r\nhis words. He would talk of the wonderful powers of man, of their\r\npresent state and of their hopes: of what they had been and what they\r\nwere, and when reason could no longer guide him, his imagination as if\r\ninspired shed light on the obscurity that veils the past and the\r\nfuture. He loved to dwell on what might have been the state of the\r\nearth before man lived on it, and how he first arose and gradually\r\nbecame the strange, complicated, but as he said, the glorious creature\r\nhe now is. Covering the earth with their creations and forming by the\r\npower of their minds another world more lovely than the visible frame\r\nof things, even all the world that we find in their writings. A\r\nbeautiful creation, he would say, which may claim this superiority to\r\nits model, that good and evil is more easily seperated[:] the good\r\nrewarded in the way they themselves desire; the evil punished as all\r\nthings evil ought to be punished, not by pain which is revolting to\r\nall philanthropy to consider but by quiet obscurity, which simply\r\ndeprives them of their harmful qualities; why kill the serpent when\r\nyou have extracted his fangs?\r\n\r\nThe poetry of his language and ideas which my words ill convey held me\r\nenchained to his discourses. It was a melancholy pleasure to me to\r\nlisten to his inspired words; to catch for a moment the light of his\r\neyes[;] to feel a transient sympathy and then to awaken from the\r\ndelusion, again to know that all this was nothing,--a dream--a shadow\r\nfor that there was no reallity for me; my father had for ever deserted\r\nme, leaving me only memories which set an eternal barrier between me\r\nand my fellow creatures. I was indeed fellow to none. He--Woodville,\r\nmourned the loss of his bride: others wept the various forms of misery\r\nas they visited them: but infamy and guilt was mingled with my\r\nportion; unlawful and detestable passion had poured its poison into my\r\nears and changed all my blood, so that it was no longer the kindly\r\nstream that supports life but a cold fountain of bitterness corrupted\r\nin its very source.[60] It must be the excess of madness that could\r\nmake me imagine that I could ever be aught but one alone; struck off\r\nfrom humanity; bearing no affinity to man or woman; a wretch on whom\r\nNature had set her ban.\r\n\r\nSometimes Woodville talked to me of himself. He related his history\r\nbrief in happiness and woe and dwelt with passion on his and Elinor's\r\nmutual love. \"She was[\"], he said, \"the brightest vision that ever\r\ncame upon the earth: there was somthing in her frank countenance, in\r\nher voice, and in every motion of her graceful form that overpowered\r\nme, as if it were a celestial creature that deigned to mingle with me\r\nin intercourse more sweet than man had ever before enjoyed. Sorrow\r\nfled before her; and her smile seemed to possess an influence like\r\nlight to irradiate all mental darkness. It was not like a human\r\nloveliness that these gentle smiles went and came; but as a sunbeam on\r\na lake, now light and now obscure, flitting before as you strove to\r\ncatch them, and fold them for ever to your heart. I saw this smile\r\nfade for ever. Alas! I could never have believed that it was indeed\r\nElinor that died if once when I spoke she had not lifted her almost\r\nbenighted eyes, and for one moment like nought beside on earth, more\r\nlovely than a sunbeam, slighter, quicker than the waving plumage of a\r\nbird, dazzling as lightning and like it giving day to night, yet mild\r\nand faint, that smile came; it went, and then there was an end of all\r\njoy to me.\"\r\n\r\nThus his own sorrows, or the shapes copied from nature that dwelt in\r\nhis mind with beauty greater than their own, occupied our talk while I\r\nrailed in my own griefs with cautious secresy. If for a moment he\r\nshewed curiosity, my eyes fell, my voice died away and my evident\r\nsuffering made him quickly endeavour to banish the ideas he had\r\nawakened; yet he for ever mingled consolation in his talk, and tried\r\nto soften my despair by demonstrations of deep sympathy and\r\ncompassion. \"We are both unhappy--\" he would say to me; \"I have told\r\nyou my melancholy tale and we have wept together the loss of that\r\nlovely spirit that has so cruelly deserted me; but you hide your\r\ngriefs: I do not ask you to disclose them, but tell me if I may not\r\nconsole you. It seems to me a wild adventure to find in this desart\r\none like you quite solitary: you are young and lovely; your manners\r\nare refined and attractive; yet there is in your settled melancholy,\r\nand something, I know not what, in your expressive eyes that seems to\r\nseperate you from your kind: you shudder; pardon me, I entreat you\r\nbut I cannot help expressing this once at least the lively interest I\r\nfeel in your destiny.\r\n\r\n\"You never smile: your voice is low, and you utter your words as if\r\nyou were afraid of the slight sound they would produce: the expression\r\nof awful and intense sorrow never for a moment fades from your\r\ncountenance. I have lost for ever the loveliest companion that any man\r\ncould ever have possessed, one who rather appears to have been a\r\nsuperior spirit who by some strange accident wandered among us earthly\r\ncreatures, than as belonging to our kind. Yet I smile, and sometimes I\r\nspeak almost forgetful of the change I have endured. But your sad mien\r\nnever alters; your pulses beat and you breathe, yet you seem already\r\nto belong to another world; and sometimes, pray pardon my wild\r\nthoughts, when you touch my hand I am surprised to find your hand warm\r\nwhen all the fire of life seems extinct within you.\r\n\r\n\"When I look upon you, the tears you shed, the soft deprecating look\r\nwith which you withstand enquiry; the deep sympathy your voice\r\nexpresses when I speak of my lesser sorrows add to my interest for\r\nyou. You stand here shelterless[.] You have cast yourself from among\r\nus and you wither on this wild plain fo[r]lorn and helpless: some\r\ndreadful calamity must have befallen you. Do not turn from me; I do\r\nnot ask you to reveal it: I only entreat you to listen to me and to\r\nbecome familiar with the voice of consolation and kindness. If pity,\r\nand admiration, and gentle affection can wean you from despair let me\r\nattempt the task. I cannot see your look of deep grief without\r\nendeavouring to restore you to happier feelings. Unbend your brow;\r\nrelax the stern melancholy of your regard; permit a friend, a sincere,\r\naffectionate friend, I will be one, to convey some relief, some\r\nmomentary pause to your sufferings.\r\n\r\n\"Do not think that I would intrude upon your confidence: I only ask\r\nyour patience. Do not for ever look sorrow and never speak it; utter\r\none word of bitter complaint and I will reprove it with gentle\r\nexhortation and pour on you the balm of compassion. You must not shut\r\nme from all communion with you: do not tell me why you grieve but only\r\nsay the words, \"I am unhappy,\" and you will feel relieved as if for\r\nsome time excluded from all intercourse by some magic spell you should\r\nsuddenly enter again the pale of human sympathy. I entreat you to\r\nbelieve in my most sincere professions and to treat me as an old and\r\ntried friend: promise me never to forget me, never causelessly to\r\nbanish me; but try to love me as one who would devote all his energies\r\nto make you happy. Give me the name of friend; I will fulfill its\r\nduties; and if for a moment complaint and sorrow would shape\r\nthemselves into words let me be near to speak peace to your vext\r\nsoul.\"\r\n\r\nI repeat his persuasions in faint terms and cannot give you at the\r\nsame time the tone and gesture that animated them. Like a refreshing\r\nshower on an arid soil they revived me, and although I still kept\r\ntheir cause secret he led me to pour forth my bitter complaints and to\r\nclothe my woe in words of gall and fire. With all the energy of\r\ndesperate grief I told him how I had fallen at once from bliss to\r\nmisery; how that for me there was no joy, no hope; that death however\r\nbitter would be the welcome seal to all my pangs; death the skeleton\r\nwas to be beautiful as love. I know not why but I found it sweet to\r\nutter these words to human ears; and though I derided all consolation\r\nyet I was pleased to see it offered me with gentleness and kindness. I\r\nlistened quietly, and when he paused would again pour out my misery in\r\nexpressions that shewed how far too deep my wounds were for any cure.\r\n\r\nBut now also I began to reap the fruits of my perfect solitude. I had\r\nbecome unfit for any intercourse, even with Woodville the most gentle\r\nand sympathizing creature that existed. I had become captious and\r\nunreasonable: my temper was utterly spoilt. I called him my friend but\r\nI viewed all he did with jealous eyes. If he did not visit me at the\r\nappointed hour I was angry, very angry, and told him that if indeed he\r\ndid feel interest in me it was cold, and could not be fitted for me, a\r\npoor worn creature, whose deep unhappiness demanded much more than his\r\nworldly heart could give. When for a moment I imagined that his manner\r\nwas cold I would fretfully say to him--\"I was at peace before you\r\ncame; why have you disturbed me? You have given me new wants and now\r\nyour trifle with me as if my heart were as whole as yours, as if I\r\nwere not in truth a shorn lamb thrust out on the bleak hill side,\r\ntortured by every blast. I wished for no friend, no sympathy[.] I\r\navoided you, you know I did, but you forced yourself upon me and gave\r\nme those wants which you see with triump[h] give you power over me. Oh\r\nthe brave power of the bitter north wind which freezes the tears it\r\nhas caused to shed! But I will not bear this; go: the sun will rise\r\nand set as before you came, and I shall sit among the pines or wander\r\non the heath weeping and complaining without wishing for you to\r\nlisten. You are cruel, very cruel, to treat me who bleed at every pore\r\nin this rough manner.\"[61]\r\n\r\nAnd then, when in answer to my peevish words, I saw his countenance\r\nbent with living pity on me[,] when I saw him\r\n\r\n    Gli occhi drizzo ver me con quel sembiante\r\n    Che madre fa sopra figlioul deliro    P[a]radiso. C 1.[62]\r\n\r\nI wept and said, \"Oh, pardon me! You are good and kind but I am not\r\nfit for life. Why am I obliged to live? To drag hour after hour, to\r\nsee the trees wave their branches restlessly, to feel the air, & to\r\nsuffer in all I feel keenest agony. My frame is strong, but my soul\r\nsinks beneath this endurance of living anguish. Death is the goal that\r\nI would attain, but, alas! I do not even see the end of the course. Do\r\nyou, my compassionate friend,[63] tell me how to die peacefully and\r\ninnocently and I will bless you: all that I, poor wretch, can desire\r\nis a painless death.\"\r\n\r\nBut Woodville's words had magic in them, when beginning with the\r\nsweetest pity, he would raise me by degrees out of myself and my\r\nsorrows until I wondered at my own selfishness: but he left me and\r\ndespair returned; the work of consolation was ever to begin anew. I\r\noften desired his entire absence; for I found that I was grown out of\r\nthe ways of life and that by long seclusion, although I could support\r\nmy accustomed grief, and drink the bitter daily draught with some\r\ndegree of patience, yet I had become unfit for the slightest novelty\r\nof feeling. Expectation, and hopes, and affection were all too much\r\nfor me. I knew this, but at other times I was unreasonable and laid\r\nthe blame upon him, who was most blameless, and pevishly thought that\r\nif his gentle soul were more gentle, if his intense sympathy were more\r\nintense, he could drive the fiend from my soul and make me more human.\r\nI am, I thought, a tragedy; a character that he comes to see act: now\r\nand then he gives me my cue[64] that I may make a speech more to his\r\npurpose: perhaps he is already planning a poem in which I am to\r\nfigure. I am a farce and play to him, but to me this is all dreary\r\nreality: he takes all the profit and I bear all the burthen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a strange circumstance but it often occurs that blessings by\r\ntheir use turn to curses; and that I who in solitude had desired\r\nsympathy as the only relief I could enjoy should now find it an\r\nadditional torture to me. During my father's life time I had always\r\nbeen of an affectionate and forbearing disposition, but since those\r\ndays of joy alas! I was much changed. I had become arrogant, peevish,\r\nand above all suspicious. Although the real interest of my narration\r\nis now ended and I ought quickly to wind up its melancholy\r\ncatastrophe, yet I will relate one instance of my sad suspicion and\r\ndespair and how Woodville with the goodness and almost the power of an\r\nangel, softened my rugged feelings and led me back to gentleness.[65]\r\n\r\nHe had promised to spend some hours with me one afternoon but a\r\nviolent and continual rain[66] prevented him. I was alone the whole\r\nevening. I had passed two whole years alone unrepining, but now I was\r\nmiserable. He could not really care for me, I thought, for if he did\r\nthe storm would rather have made him come even if I had not expected\r\nhim, than, as it did, prevent a promised visit. He would well know\r\nthat this drear sky and gloomy rain would load my spirit almost to\r\nmadness: if the weather had been fine I should not have regretted his\r\nabsence as heavily as I necessarily must shut up in this miserable\r\ncottage with no companions but my own wretched thoughts. If he were\r\ntruly my friend he would have calculated all this; and let me now\r\ncalculate this boasted friendship, and discover its real worth. He got\r\nover his grief for Elinor, and the country became dull to him, so he\r\nwas glad to find even me for amusement; and when he does not know what\r\nelse to do he passes his lazy hours here, and calls this\r\nfriendship--It is true that his presence is a consolation to me, and\r\nthat his words are sweet, and, when he will he can pour forth thoughts\r\nthat win me from despair. His words are sweet,--and so, truly, is the\r\nhoney of the bee, but the bee has a sting, and unkindness is a worse\r\nsmart that that received from an insect's venom. I will[67] put him to\r\nthe proof. He says all hope is dead to him, and I know that it is dead\r\nto me, so we are both equally fitted for death. Let me try if he will\r\ndie with me; and as I fear to die alone, if he will accompany [me] to\r\ncheer me, and thus he can shew himself my friend in the only manner my\r\nmisery will permit.[68]\r\n\r\nIt was madness I believe, but I so worked myself up to this idea that\r\nI could think of nothing else. If he dies with me it is well, and\r\nthere will be an end of two miserable beings; and if he will not, then\r\nwill I scoff at his friendship and drink the poison before him to\r\nshame his cowardice. I planned the whole scene with an earnest heart\r\nand franticly set my soul on this project. I procured Laudanum and\r\nplacing it in two glasses on the table, filled my room with flowers\r\nand decorated the last scene of my tragedy with the nicest care. As\r\nthe hour for his coming approached my heart softened and I wept; not\r\nthat I gave up my plan, but even when resolved the mind must undergo\r\nseveral revolutions of feeling before it can drink its death.\r\n\r\nNow all was ready and Woodville came. I received him at the door of my\r\ncottage and leading him solemnly into the room, I said: \"My friend, I\r\nwish to die. I am quite weary of enduring the misery which hourly I do\r\nendure, and I will throw it off. What slave will not, if he may,\r\nescape from his chains? Look, I weep: for more than two years I have\r\nnever enjoyed one moment free from anguish. I have often desired to\r\ndie; but I am a very coward. It is hard for one so young who was once\r\nso happy as I was; [_sic_] voluntarily to divest themselves of all\r\nsensation and to go alone to the dreary grave; I dare not. I must die,\r\nyet my fear chills me; I pause and shudder and then for months I\r\nendure my excess of wretchedness. But now the time is come when I may\r\nquit life, I have a friend who will not refuse to accompany me in this\r\ndark journey; such is my request:[69] earnestly do I entreat and\r\nimplore you to die with me. Then we shall find Elinor and what I have\r\nlost. Look, I am prepared; there is the death draught, let us drink it\r\ntogether and willingly & joyfully quit this hated round of daily\r\nlife[.]\r\n\r\n\"You turn from me; yet before you deny me reflect, Woodville, how\r\nsweet it were to cast off the load of tears and misery under which we\r\nnow labour: and surely we shall find light after we have passed the\r\ndark valley. That drink will plunge us in a sweet slumber, and when we\r\nawaken what joy will be ours to find all our sorrows and fears past.\r\n_A little patience, and all will be over_; aye, a very little\r\npatience; for, look, there is the key of our prison; we hold it in our\r\nown hands, and are we more debased than slaves to cast it away and\r\ngive ourselves up to voluntary bondage? Even now if we had courage we\r\nmight be free. Behold, my cheek is flushed with pleasure at the\r\nimagination of death; all that we love are dead. Come, give me your\r\nhand, one look of joyous sympathy and we will go together and seek\r\nthem; a lulling journey; where our arrival will bring bliss and our\r\nwaking be that of angels. Do you delay? Are you a coward, Woodville?\r\nOh fie! Cast off this blank look of human melancholy. Oh! that I had\r\nwords to express the luxury of death that I might win you. I tell you\r\nwe are no longer miserable mortals; we are about to become Gods;\r\nspirits free and happy as gods. What fool on a bleak shore, seeing a\r\nflowery isle on the other side with his lost love beckoning to him\r\nfrom it would pause because the wave is dark and turbid?\r\n\r\n    \"What if some little payne the passage have\r\n    That makes frayle flesh to fear the bitter wave?\r\n    Is not short payne well borne that brings long ease,\r\n    And lays the soul to sleep in quiet grave?[F]\r\n\r\n\"Do you mark my words; I have learned the language of despair: I have\r\nit all by heart, for I am Despair; and a strange being am I, joyous,\r\ntriumphant Despair. But those words are false, for the wave may be\r\ndark but it is not bitter. We lie down, and close our eyes with a\r\ngentle good night, and when we wake, we are free. Come then, no more\r\ndelay, thou tardy one! Behold the pleasant potion! Look, I am a spirit\r\nof good, and not a human maid that invites thee, and with winning\r\naccents, (oh, that they would win thee!) says, Come and drink.\"[70]\r\n\r\nAs I spoke I fixed my eyes upon his countenance, and his exquisite\r\nbeauty, the heavenly compassion that beamed from his eyes, his gentle\r\nyet earnest look of deprecation and wonder even before he spoke\r\nwrought a change in my high strained feelings taking from me all the\r\nsterness of despair and filling me only with the softest grief. I saw\r\nhis eyes humid also as he took both my hands in his; and sitting down\r\nnear me, he said:[71]\r\n\r\n\"This is a sad deed to which you would lead me, dearest friend, and\r\nyour woe must indeed be deep that could fill you with these unhappy\r\nthoughts. You long for death and yet you fear it and wish me to be\r\nyour companion. But I have less courage than you and even thus\r\naccompanied I dare not die. Listen to me, and then reflect if you\r\nought to win me to your project, even if with the over-bearing\r\neloquence of despair you could make black death so inviting that the\r\nfair heaven should appear darkness. Listen I entreat you to the words\r\nof one who has himself nurtured desperate thoughts, and longed with\r\nimpatient desire for death, but who has at length trampled the phantom\r\nunder foot, and crushed his sting. Come, as you have played Despair\r\nwith me I will play the part of Una with you and bring you hurtless\r\nfrom his dark cavern. Listen to me, and let yourself be softened by\r\nwords in which no selfish passion lingers.\r\n\r\n\"We know not what all this wide world means; its strange mixture of\r\ngood and evil. But we have been placed here and bid live and hope. I\r\nknow not what we are to hope; but there is some good beyond us that we\r\nmust seek; and that is our earthly task. If misfortune come against us\r\nwe must fight with her; we must cast her aside, and still go on to\r\nfind out that which it is our nature to desire. Whether this prospect\r\nof future good be the preparation for another existence I know not; or\r\nwhether that it is merely that we, as workmen in God's vineyard, must\r\nlend a hand to smooth the way for our posterity. If it indeed be that;\r\nif the efforts of the virtuous now, are to make the future inhabitants\r\nof this fair world more happy; if the labours of those who cast aside\r\nselfishness, and try to know the truth of things, are to free the men\r\nof ages, now far distant but which will one day come, from the burthen\r\nunder which those who now live groan, and like you weep bitterly; if\r\nthey free them but from one of what are now the necessary evils of\r\nlife, truly I will not fail but will with my whole soul aid the work.\r\nFrom my youth I have said, I will be virtuous; I will dedicate my life\r\nfor the good of others; I will do my best to extirpate evil and if the\r\nspirit who protects ill should so influence circumstances that I\r\nshould suffer through my endeavour, yet while there is hope and hope\r\nthere ever must be, of success, cheerfully do I gird myself to my\r\ntask.\r\n\r\n\"I have powers; my countrymen think well of them. Do you think I sow\r\nmy seed in the barren air, & have no end in what I do? Believe me, I\r\nwill never desert life untill this last hope is torn from my bosom,\r\nthat in some way my labours may form a link in the chain of gold with\r\nwhich we ought all to strive to drag Happiness from where she sits\r\nenthroned above the clouds, now far beyond our reach, to inhabit the\r\nearth with us. Let us suppose that Socrates, or Shakespear, or\r\nRousseau had been seized with despair and died in youth when they were\r\nas young as I am; do you think that we and all the world should not\r\nhave lost incalculable improvement in our good feelings and our\r\nhappiness thro' their destruction. I am not like one of these; they\r\ninfluenced millions: but if I can influence but a hundred, but ten,\r\nbut one solitary individual, so as in any way to lead him from ill to\r\ngood, that will be a joy to repay me for all my sufferings, though\r\nthey were a million times multiplied; and that hope will support me to\r\nbear them[.]\r\n\r\n\"And those who do not work for posterity; or working, as may be my\r\ncase, will not be known by it; yet they, believe me, have also their\r\nduties. You grieve because you are unhappy[;] it is happiness you seek\r\nbut you despair of obtaining it. But if you can bestow happiness on\r\nanother; if you can give one other person only one hour of joy ought\r\nyou not to live to do it? And every one has it in their power to do\r\nthat. The inhabitants of this world suffer so much pain. In crowded\r\ncities, among cultivated plains, or on the desart mountains, pain is\r\nthickly sown, and if we can tear up but one of these noxious weeds, or\r\nmore, if in its stead we can sow one seed of corn, or plant one fair\r\nflower, let that be motive sufficient against suicide. Let us not\r\ndesert our task while there is the slightest hope that we may in a\r\nfuture day do this.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I dare not die. I have a mother whose support and hope I am. I\r\nhave a friend who loves me as his life, and in whose breast I should\r\ninfix a mortal sting if I ungratefully left him. So I will not die.\r\nNor shall you, my friend; cheer up; cease to weep, I entreat you. Are\r\nyou not young, and fair, and good? Why should you despair? Or if you\r\nmust for yourself, why for others? If you can never be happy, can you\r\nnever bestow happiness[?] Oh! believe me, if you beheld on lips pale\r\nwith grief one smile of joy and gratitude, and knew that you were\r\nparent of that smile, and that without you it had never been, you\r\nwould feel so pure and warm a happiness that you would wish to live\r\nfor ever again and again to enjoy the same pleasure[.]\r\n\r\n\"Come, I see that you have already cast aside the sad thoughts you\r\nbefore franticly indulged. Look in that mirror; when I came your brow\r\nwas contracted, your eyes deep sunk in your head, your lips quivering;\r\nyour hands trembled violently when I took them; but now all is\r\ntranquil and soft. You are grieved and there is grief in the\r\nexpression of your countenance but it is gentle and sweet. You allow\r\nme to throw away this cursed drink; you smile; oh, Congratulate me,\r\nhope is triumphant, and I have done some good.\"\r\n\r\nThese words are shadowy as I repeat them but they were indeed words of\r\nfire and produced a warm hope in me (I, miserable wretch, to hope!)\r\nthat tingled like pleasure in my veins. He did not leave me for many\r\nhours; not until he had improved the spark that he had kindled, and\r\nwith an angelic hand fostered the return of somthing that seemed like\r\njoy. He left me but I still was calm, and after I had saluted the\r\nstarry sky and dewy earth with eyes of love and a contented good\r\nnight, I slept sweetly, visited by dreams, the first of pleasure I had\r\nhad for many long months.\r\n\r\nBut this was only a momentary relief and my old habits of feeling\r\nreturned; for I was doomed while in life to grieve, and to the natural\r\nsorrow of my father's death and its most terrific cause, immagination\r\nadded a tenfold weight of woe. I believed myself to be polluted by the\r\nunnatural love I had inspired, and that I was a creature cursed and\r\nset apart by nature. I thought that like another Cain, I had a mark\r\nset on my forehead to shew mankind that there was a barrier between me\r\nand they [_sic_].[72] Woodville had told me that there was in my\r\ncountenance an expression as if I belonged to another world; so he had\r\nseen that sign: and there it lay a gloomy mark to tell the world that\r\nthere was that within my soul that no silence could render\r\nsufficiently obscure. Why when fate drove me to become this outcast\r\nfrom human feeling; this monster with whom none might mingle in\r\nconverse and love; why had she not from that fatal and most accursed\r\nmoment, shrouded me in thick mists and placed real darkness between me\r\nand my fellows so that I might never more be seen?, [_sic_] and as I\r\npassed, like a murky cloud loaded with blight, they might only\r\nperceive me by the cold chill I should cast upon them; telling them,\r\nhow truly, that something unholy was near? Then I should have lived\r\nupon this dreary heath unvisited, and blasting none by my unhallowed\r\ngaze. Alas! I verily believe that if the near prospect of death did\r\nnot dull and soften my bitter [fe]elings, if for a few months longer I\r\nhad continued to live as I then lived, strong in body, but my soul\r\ncorrupted to its core by a deadly cancer[,] if day after day I had\r\ndwelt on these dreadful sentiments I should have become mad, and\r\nshould have fancied myself a living pestilence: so horrible to my own\r\nsolitary thoughts did this form, this voice, and all this wretched\r\nself appear; for had it not been the source of guilt that wants a\r\nname?[73]\r\n\r\nThis was superstition. I did not feel thus franticly when first I knew\r\nthat the holy name of father was become a curse to me: but my lonely\r\nlife inspired me with wild thoughts; and then when I saw Woodville &\r\nday after day he tried to win my confidence and I never dared give\r\nwords to my dark tale, I was impressed more strongly with the\r\nwithering fear that I was in truth a marked creature, a pariah, only\r\nfit for death.\r\n\r\n\r\n[F] Spencer's Faery Queen Book 1--Canto [9]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I was perpetually haunted by these ideas, you may imagine that the\r\ninfluence of Woodville's words was very temporary; and that although I\r\ndid not again accuse him of unkindness, yet I soon became as unhappy\r\nas before. Soon after this incident we parted. He heard that his\r\nmother was ill, and he hastened to her. He came to take leave of me,\r\nand we walked together on the heath for the last time. He promised\r\nthat he would come and see me again; and bade me take cheer, and to\r\nencourage what happy thoughts I could, untill time and fortitude\r\nshould overcome my misery, and I could again mingle in society.\r\n\r\n\"Above all other admonition on my part,\" he said, \"cherish and follow\r\nthis one: do not despair. That is the most dangerous gulph on which\r\nyou perpetually totter; but you must reassure your steps, and take\r\nhope to guide you.[74] Hope, and your wounds will be already half\r\nhealed: but if you obstinately despair, there never more will be\r\ncomfort for you. Believe me, my dearest friend, that there is a joy\r\nthat the sun and earth and all its beauties can bestow that you will\r\none day feel. The refreshing bliss of Love will again visit your\r\nheart, and undo the spell that binds you to woe, untill you wonder how\r\nyour eyes could be closed in the long night that burthens you. I dare\r\nnot hope that I have inspired you with sufficient interest that the\r\nthought of me, and the affection that I shall ever bear you, will\r\nsoften your melancholy and decrease the bitterness of your tears. But\r\nif my friendship can make you look on life with less disgust, beware\r\nhow you injure it with suspicion. Love is a delicate sprite[75] and\r\neasily hurt by rough jealousy. Guard, I entreat you, a firm persuasion\r\nof my sincerity in the inmost recesses of your heart out of the reach\r\nof the casual winds that may disturb its surface. Your temper is made\r\nunequal by suffering, and the tenor of your mind is, I fear, sometimes\r\nshaken by unworthy causes; but let your confidence in my sympathy and\r\nlove be deeper far, and incapable of being reached by these agitations\r\nthat come and go, and if they touch not your affections leave you\r\nuninjured.\"\r\n\r\nThese were some of Woodville's last lessons. I wept as I listened to\r\nhim; and after we had taken an affectionate farewell, I followed him\r\nfar with my eyes until they saw the last of my earthly comforter. I\r\nhad insisted on accompanying him across the heath towards the town\r\nwhere he dwelt: the sun was yet high when he left me, and I turned my\r\nsteps towards my cottage. It was at the latter end of the month of\r\nSeptember when the nights have become chill. But the weather was\r\nserene, and as I walked on I fell into no unpleasing reveries. I\r\nthought of Woodville with gratitude and kindness and did not, I know\r\nnot why, regret his departure with any bitterness. It seemed that\r\nafter one great shock all other change was trivial to me; and I walked\r\non wondering when the time would come when we should all four, my\r\ndearest father restored to me, meet in some sweet Paradise[.] I\r\npictured to myself a lovely river such as that on whose banks Dante\r\ndescribes Mathilda gathering flowers, which ever flows\r\n\r\n             ---- bruna, bruna,\r\n    Sotto l'ombra perpetua, che mai\r\n    Raggiar non lascia sole ivi, n\u00e8 Luna.[76]\r\n\r\nAnd then I repeated to myself all that lovely passage that relates the\r\nentrance of Dante into the terrestrial Paradise; and thought it would\r\nbe sweet when I wandered on those lovely banks to see the car of light\r\ndescend with my long lost parent to be restored to me. As I waited\r\nthere in expectation of that moment, I thought how, of the lovely\r\nflowers that grew there, I would wind myself a chaplet and crown\r\nmyself for joy: I would sing _sul margine d'un rio_,[77] my father's\r\nfavourite song, and that my voice gliding through the windless air\r\nwould announce to him in whatever bower he sat expecting the moment of\r\nour union, that his daughter was come. Then the mark of misery would\r\nhave faded from my brow, and I should raise my eyes fearlessly to meet\r\nhis, which ever beamed with the soft lustre of innocent love. When I\r\nreflected on the magic look of those deep eyes I wept, but gently,\r\nlest my sobs should disturb the fairy scene.\r\n\r\nI was so entirely wrapt in this reverie that I wandered on, taking no\r\nheed of my steps until I actually stooped down to gather a flower for\r\nmy wreath on that bleak plain where no flower grew, when I awoke from\r\nmy day dream and found myself I knew not where.\r\n\r\nThe sun had set and the roseate hue which the clouds had caught from\r\nhim in his descent had nearly died away. A wind swept across the\r\nplain, I looked around me and saw no object that told me where I was;\r\nI had lost myself, and in vain attempted to find my path. I wandered\r\non, and the coming darkness made every trace indistinct by which I\r\nmight be guided. At length all was veiled in the deep obscurity of\r\nblackest night; I became weary and knowing that my servant was to\r\nsleep that night at the neighbouring village, so that my absence would\r\nalarm no one; and that I was safe in this wild spot from every\r\nintruder, I resolved to spend the night where I was. Indeed I was too\r\nweary to walk further: the air was chill but I was careless of bodily\r\ninconvenience, and I thought that I was well inured to the weather\r\nduring my two years of solitude, when no change of seasons prevented\r\nmy perpetual wanderings.\r\n\r\nI lay upon the grass surrounded by a darkness which not the slightest\r\nbeam of light penetrated--There was no sound for the deep night had\r\nlaid to sleep the insects, the only creatures that lived on the lone\r\nspot where no tree or shrub could afford shelter to aught else--There\r\nwas a wondrous silence in the air that calmed my senses yet which\r\nenlivened my soul, my mind hurried from image to image and seemed to\r\ngrasp an eternity. All in my heart was shadowy yet calm, untill my\r\nideas became confused and at length died away in sleep.[78]\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke it rained:[79] I was already quite wet, and my limbs were\r\nstiff and my head giddy with the chill of night. It was a drizzling,\r\npenetrating shower; as my dank hair clung to my neck and partly\r\ncovered my face, I had hardly strength to part with my fingers, the\r\nlong strait locks that fell before my eyes. The darkness was much\r\ndissipated and in the east where the clouds were least dense the moon\r\nwas visible behind the thin grey cloud--\r\n\r\n    The moon is behind, and at the full\r\n    And yet she looks both small and dull.[80]\r\n\r\nIts presence gave me a hope that by its means I might find my home.\r\nBut I was languid and many hours passed before I could reach the\r\ncottage, dragging as I did my slow steps, and often resting on the wet\r\nearth unable to proceed.\r\n\r\nI particularly mark this night, for it was that which has hurried on\r\nthe last scene of my tragedy, which else might have dwindled on\r\nthrough long years of listless sorrow. I was very ill when I arrived\r\nand quite incapable of taking off my wet clothes that clung about me.\r\nIn the morning, on her return, my servant found me almost lifeless,\r\nwhile possessed by a high fever I was lying on the floor of my room.\r\n\r\nI was very ill for a long time, and when I recovered from the\r\nimmediate danger of fever, every symptom of a rapid consumption\r\ndeclared itself. I was for some time ignorant of this and thought that\r\nmy excessive weakness was the consequence of the fever; [_sic_] But my\r\nstrength became less and less; as winter came on I had a cough; and my\r\nsunken cheek, before pale, burned with a hectic fever. One by one\r\nthese symptoms struck me; & I became convinced that the moment I had\r\nso much desired was about to arrive and that I was dying. I was\r\nsitting by my fire, the physician who had attended me ever since my\r\nfever had just left me, and I looked over his prescription in which\r\ndigitalis was the prominent medecine. \"Yes,\" I said, \"I see how this\r\nis, and it is strange that I should have deceived myself so long; I am\r\nabout to die an innocent death, and it will be sweeter even than that\r\nwhich the opium promised.\"\r\n\r\nI rose and walked slowly to the window; the wide heath was covered by\r\nsnow which sparkled under the beams of the sun that shone brightly\r\nthro' the pure, frosty air: a few birds were pecking some crumbs under\r\nmy window.[81] I smiled with quiet joy; and in my thoughts, which\r\nthrough long habit would for ever connect themselves into one train,\r\nas if I shaped them into words, I thus addressed the scene before me:\r\n\r\n\"I salute thee, beautiful Sun, and thou, white Earth, fair and cold!\r\nPerhaps I shall never see thee again covered with green, and the sweet\r\nflowers of the coming spring will blossom on my grave. I am about to\r\nleave thee; soon this living spirit which is ever busy among strange\r\nshapes and ideas, which belong not to thee, soon it will have flown to\r\nother regions and this emaciated body will rest insensate on thy bosom\r\n\r\n    \"Rolled round in earth's diurnal course\r\n    With rocks, and stones, and trees.\r\n\r\n\"For it will be the same with thee, who art called our Universal\r\nMother,[82] when I am gone. I have loved thee; and in my days both of\r\nhappiness and sorrow I have peopled your solitudes with wild fancies\r\nof my own creation. The woods, and lakes, and mountains which I have\r\nloved, have for me a thousand associations; and thou, oh, Sun! hast\r\nsmiled upon, and borne your part in many imaginations that sprung to\r\nlife in my soul alone, and which will die with me. Your solitudes,\r\nsweet land, your trees and waters will still exist, moved by your\r\nwinds, or still beneath the eye of noon, though[83] [w]hat I have felt\r\nabout ye, and all my dreams which have often strangely deformed thee,\r\nwill die with me. You will exist to reflect other images in other\r\nminds, and ever will remain the same, although your reflected\r\nsemblance vary in a thousand ways, changeable as the hearts of those\r\nwho view thee. One of these fragile mirrors, that ever doted on thine\r\nimage, is about to be broken, crumbled to dust. But everteeming Nature\r\nwill create another and another, and thou wilt loose nought by my\r\ndestruction.[84]\r\n\r\n\"Thou wilt ever be the same. Recieve then the grateful farewell of a\r\nfleeting shadow who is about to disappear, who joyfully leaves thee,\r\nyet with a last look of affectionate thankfulness. Farewell! Sky, and\r\nfields and woods; the lovely flowers that grow on thee; thy mountains\r\n& thy rivers; to the balmy air and the strong wind of the north, to\r\nall, a last farewell. I shall shed no more tears for my task is almost\r\nfulfilled, and I am about to be rewarded for long and most burthensome\r\nsuffering. Bless thy child even even [_sic_] in death, as I bless\r\nthee; and let me sleep at peace in my quiet grave.\"\r\n\r\nI feel death to be near at hand and I am calm. I no longer despair,\r\nbut look on all around me with placid affection. I find it sweet to\r\nwatch the progressive decay of my strength, and to repeat to myself,\r\nanother day and yet another, but again I shall not see the red leaves\r\nof autumn; before that time I shall be with my father. I am glad\r\nWoodville is not with me for perhaps he would grieve, and I desire to\r\nsee smiles alone during the last scene of my life; when I last wrote\r\nto him I told him of my ill health but not of its mortal tendency,\r\nlest he should conceive it to be his duty to come to me for I fear\r\nlest the tears of friendship should destroy the blessed calm of my\r\nmind. I take pleasure in arranging all the little details which will\r\noccur when I shall no longer be. In truth I am in love with death; no\r\nmaiden ever took more pleasure in the contemplation of her bridal\r\nattire than I in fancying my limbs already enwrapt in their shroud:\r\nis it not my marriage dress? Alone it will unite me to my father when\r\nin an eternal mental union we shall never part.\r\n\r\nI will not dwell on the last changes that I feel in the final decay of\r\nnature. It is rapid but without pain: I feel a strange pleasure in it.\r\nFor long years these are the first days of peace that have visited me.\r\nI no longer exhaust my miserable heart by bitter tears and frantic\r\ncomplaints; I no longer the [_sic_] reproach the sun, the earth, the\r\nair, for pain and wretchedness. I wait in quiet expectation for the\r\nclosing hours of a life which has been to me most sweet & bitter. I do\r\nnot die not having enjoyed life; for sixteen years I was happy: during\r\nthe first months of my father's return I had enjoyed ages of pleasure:\r\nnow indeed I am grown old in grief; my steps are feeble like those of\r\nage; I have become peevish and unfit for life; so having passed little\r\nmore than twenty years upon the earth I am more fit for my narrow\r\ngrave than many are when they reach the natural term of their lives.\r\n\r\nAgain and again I have passed over in my remembrance the different\r\nscenes of my short life: if the world is a stage and I merely an actor\r\non it my part has been strange, and, alas! tragical. Almost from\r\ninfancy I was deprived of all the testimonies of affection which\r\nchildren generally receive; I was thrown entirely upon my own\r\nresources, and I enjoyed what I may almost call unnatural pleasures,\r\nfor they were dreams and not realities. The earth was to me a magic\r\nlantern and I [a] gazer, and a listener but no actor; but then came\r\nthe transporting and soul-reviving era of my existence: my father\r\nreturned and I could pour my warm affections on a human heart; there\r\nwas a new sun and a new earth created to me; the waters of existence\r\nsparkled: joy! joy! but, alas! what grief! My bliss was more rapid\r\nthan the progress of a sunbeam on a mountain, which discloses its\r\nglades & woods, and then leaves it dark & blank; to my happiness\r\nfollowed madness and agony, closed by despair.\r\n\r\nThis was the drama of my life which I have now depicted upon paper.\r\nDuring three months I have been employed in this task. The memory of\r\nsorrow has brought tears; the memory of happiness a warm glow the\r\nlively shadow of that joy. Now my tears are dried; the glow has faded\r\nfrom my cheeks, and with a few words of farewell to you, Woodville, I\r\nclose my work: the last that I shall perform.\r\n\r\nFarewell, my only living friend; you are the sole tie that binds me to\r\nexistence, and now I break it[.] It gives me no pain to leave you; nor\r\ncan our seperation give you much. You never regarded me as one of this\r\nworld, but rather as a being, who for some penance was sent from the\r\nKingdom of Shadows; and she passed a few days weeping on the earth and\r\nlonging to return to her native soil. You will weep but they will be\r\ntears of gentleness. I would, if I thought that it would lessen your\r\nregret, tell you to smile and congratulate me on my departure from the\r\nmisery you beheld me endure. I would say; Woodville, rejoice with your\r\nfriend, I triumph now and am most happy. But I check these\r\nexpressions; these may not be the consolations of the living; they\r\nweep for their own misery, and not for that of the being they have\r\nlost. No; shed a few natural tears due to my memory: and if you ever\r\nvisit my grave, pluck from thence a flower, and lay it to your heart;\r\nfor your heart is the only tomb in which my memory will be enterred.\r\n\r\nMy death is rapidly approaching and you are not near to watch the\r\nflitting and vanishing of my spirit. Do no[t] regret this; for death\r\nis a too terrible an [_sic_] object for the living. It is one of those\r\nadversities which hurt instead of purifying the heart; for it is so\r\nintense a misery that it hardens & dulls the feelings. Dreadful as the\r\ntime was when I pursued my father towards the ocean, & found their\r\n[_sic_] only his lifeless corpse; yet for my own sake I should prefer\r\nthat to the watching one by one his senses fade; his pulse weaken--and\r\nsleeplessly as it were devour his life in gazing. To see life in his\r\nlimbs & to know that soon life would no longer be there; to see the\r\nwarm breath issue from his lips and to know they would soon be\r\nchill--I will not continue to trace this frightful picture; you\r\nsuffered this torture once; I never did.[85] And the remembrance fills\r\nyour heart sometimes with bitter despair when otherwise your feelings\r\nwould have melted into soft sorrow.\r\n\r\nSo day by day I become weaker, and life flickers in my wasting form,\r\nas a lamp about to loose it vivifying oil. I now behold the glad sun\r\nof May. It was May, four years ago, that I first saw my beloved\r\nfather; it was in May, three years ago that my folly destroyed the\r\nonly being I was doomed to love. May is returned, and I die. Three\r\ndays ago, the anniversary of our meeting; and, alas! of our eternal\r\nseperation, after a day of killing emotion, I caused myself to be led\r\nonce more to behold the face of nature. I caused myself to be carried\r\nto some meadows some miles distant from my cottage; the grass was\r\nbeing mowed, and there was the scent of hay in the fields; all the\r\nearth look[ed] fresh and its inhabitants happy. Evening approached and\r\nI beheld the sun set. Three years ago and on that day and hour it\r\nshone through the branches and leaves of the beech wood and its beams\r\nflickered upon the countenance of him whom I then beheld for the last\r\ntime.[86] I now saw that divine orb, gilding all the clouds with\r\nunwonted splendour, sink behind the horizon; it disappeared from a\r\nworld where he whom I would seek exists not; it approached a world\r\nwhere he exists not[.] Why do I weep so bitterly? Why my [_sic_] does\r\nmy heart heave with vain endeavour to cast aside the bitter anguish\r\nthat covers it \"as the waters cover the sea.\" I go from this world\r\nwhere he is no longer and soon I shall meet him in another.\r\n\r\nFarewell, Woodville, the turf will soon be green on my grave; and the\r\nviolets will bloom on it. _There_ is my hope and my expectation;\r\nyour's are in this world; may they be fulfilled.[87]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO _MATHILDA_\r\n\r\nAbbreviations:\r\n\r\n_F of F--A_ _The Fields of Fancy_, in Lord Abinger's notebook\r\n_F of F--B_ _The Fields of Fancy_, in the notebook in the Bodleian Library\r\n_S-R fr_     fragments of _The Fields of Fancy_ among the papers of the\r\n               late Sir John Shelley-Rolls, now in the Bodleian Library\r\n\r\n[1] The name is spelled thus in the MSS of _Mathilda_ and _The Fields\r\nof Fancy_, though in the printed _Journal_ (taken from _Shelley and\r\nMary_) and in the _Letters_ it is spelled _Matilda_. In the MS of the\r\njournal, however, it is spelled first _Matilda_, later _Mathilda_.\r\n\r\n[2] Mary has here added detail and contrast to the description in _F\r\nof F--A_, in which the passage \"save a few black patches ... on the\r\nplain ground\" does not appear.\r\n\r\n[3] The addition of \"I am alone ... withered me\" motivates Mathilda's\r\nstate of mind and her resolve to write her history.\r\n\r\n[4] Mathilda too is the unwitting victim in a story of incest. Like\r\nOedipus, she has lost her parent-lover by suicide; like him she leaves\r\nthe scene of the revelation overwhelmed by a sense of her own guilt,\r\n\"a sacred horror\"; like him, she finds a measure of peace as she is\r\nabout to die.\r\n\r\n[5] The addition of \"the precious memorials ... gratitude towards\r\nyou,\" by its suggestion of the relationship between Mathilda and\r\nWoodville, serves to justify the detailed narration.\r\n\r\n[6] At this point two sheets have been removed from the notebook.\r\nThere is no break in continuity, however.\r\n\r\n[7] The descriptions of Mathilda's father and mother and the account\r\nof their marriage in the next few pages are greatly expanded from _F\r\nof F--A_, where there is only one brief paragraph. The process of\r\nexpansion can be followed in _S-R fr_ and in _F of F--B_. The\r\ndevelopment of the character of Diana (who represents Mary's own\r\nmother, Mary Wollstonecraft) gave Mary the most trouble. For the\r\nidentifications with Mary's father and mother, see Nitchie, _Mary\r\nShelley_, pp. 11, 90-93, 96-97.\r\n\r\n[8] The passage \"There was a gentleman ... school & college vacations\"\r\nis on a slip of paper pasted on page 11 of the MS. In the margin are\r\ntwo fragments, crossed out, evidently parts of what is supplanted by\r\nthe substituted passage: \"an angelic disposition and a quick,\r\npenetrating understanding\" and \"her visits ... to ... his house were\r\nlong & frequent & there.\" In _F of F--B_ Mary wrote of Diana's\r\nunderstanding \"that often receives the name of masculine from its\r\nfirmness and strength.\" This adjective had often been applied to Mary\r\nWollstonecraft's mind. Mary Shelley's own understanding had been\r\ncalled masculine by Leigh Hunt in 1817 in the _Examiner_. The word was\r\nused also by a reviewer of her last published work, _Rambles in\r\nGermany and Italy, 1844_. (See Nitchie, _Mary Shelley_, p. 178.)\r\n\r\n[9] The account of Diana in _Mathilda_ is much better ordered and more\r\ncoherent than that in _F of F--B_.\r\n\r\n[10] The description of the effect of Diana's death on her husband is\r\nlargely new in _Mathilda_. _F of F--B_ is frankly incomplete; _F of\r\nF--A_ contains some of this material; _Mathilda_ puts it in order and\r\nfills in the gaps.\r\n\r\n[11] This paragraph is an elaboration of the description of her aunt's\r\ncoldness as found in _F of F--B_. There is only one sentence in _F of\r\nF--A_.\r\n\r\n[12] The description of Mathilda's love of nature and of animals is\r\nelaborated from both rough drafts. The effect, like that of the\r\npreceding addition (see note 11), is to emphasize Mathilda's\r\nloneliness. For the theme of loneliness in Mary Shelley's work, see\r\nNitchie, _Mary Shelley_, pp. 13-17.\r\n\r\n[13] This paragraph is a revision of _F of F--B_, which is\r\nfragmentary. There is nothing in _F of F--A_ and only one scored-out\r\nsentence in _S-R fr_. None of the rough drafts tells of her plans to\r\njoin her father.\r\n\r\n[14] The final paragraph in Chapter II is entirely new.\r\n\r\n[15] The account of the return of Mathilda's father is very slightly\r\nrevised from that in _F of F--A_. _F of F--B_ has only a few\r\nfragmentary sentences, scored out. It resumes with the paragraph\r\nbeginning, \"My father was very little changed.\"\r\n\r\n[16] Symbolic of Mathilda's subsequent life.\r\n\r\n[17] _Illusion, or the Trances of Nourjahad_, a melodrama, was\r\nperformed at Drury Lane, November 25, 1813. It was anonymous, but it\r\nwas attributed by some reviewers to Byron, a charge which he\r\nindignantly denied. See Byron, _Letters and Journals_, ed. by Rowland\r\nE. Prothero (6 vols. London: Murray, 1902-1904), II, 288.\r\n\r\n[18] This paragraph is in _F of F--B_ but not in _F of F--A_. In the\r\nmargin of the latter, however, is written: \"It was not of the tree of\r\nknowledge that I ate for no evil followed--it must be of the tree of\r\nlife that grows close beside it or--\". Perhaps this was intended to go\r\nin the preceding paragraph after \"My ideas were enlarged by his\r\nconversation.\" Then, when this paragraph was added, the figure,\r\nnoticeably changed, was included here.\r\n\r\n[19] Here the MS of _F of F--B_ breaks off to resume only with the\r\nmeeting of Mathilda and Woodville.\r\n\r\n[20] At the end of the story (p. 79) Mathilda says, \"Death is too\r\nterrible an object for the living.\" Mary was thinking of the deaths of\r\nher two children.\r\n\r\n[21] Mary had read the story of Cupid and Psyche in Apuleius in 1817\r\nand she had made an Italian translation, the MS of which is now in the\r\nLibrary of Congress. See _Journal_, pp. 79, 85-86.\r\n\r\n[22] The end of this paragraph gave Mary much trouble. In _F of F--A_\r\nafter the words, \"my tale must,\" she develops an elaborate figure: \"go\r\nwith the stream that hurries on--& now was this stream precipitated by\r\nan overwhelming fall from the pleasant vallies through which it\r\nwandered--down hideous precipieces to a desart black & hopeless--\".\r\nThis, the original ending of the chapter, was scored out, and a new,\r\nsimplified version which, with some deletions and changes, became that\r\nused in _Mathilda_ was written in the margins of two pages (ff. 57,\r\n58). This revision is a good example of Mary's frequent improvement of\r\nher style by the omission of purple patches.\r\n\r\n[23] In _F of F--A_ there follows a passage which has been scored out\r\nand which does not appear in _Mathilda_: \"I have tried in somewhat\r\nfeeble language to describe the excess of what I may almost call my\r\nadoration for my father--you may then in some faint manner imagine my\r\ndespair when I found that he shunned [me] & that all the little arts I\r\nused to re-awaken his lost love made him\"--. This is a good example of\r\nMary's frequent revision for the better by the omission of the obvious\r\nand expository. But the passage also has intrinsic interest.\r\nMathilda's \"adoration\" for her father may be compared to Mary's\r\nfeeling for Godwin. In an unpublished letter (1822) to Jane Williams\r\nshe wrote, \"Until I met Shelley I [could?] justly say that he was my\r\nGod--and I remember many childish instances of the [ex]cess of\r\nattachment I bore for him.\" See Nitchie, _Mary Shelley_, p. 89, and\r\nnote 9.\r\n\r\n[24] Cf. the account of the services of Fantasia in the opening\r\nchapter of _F of F--A_ (see pp. 90-102) together with note 3 to _The\r\nFields of Fancy_.\r\n\r\n[25] This passage beginning \"Day after day\" and closing with the\r\nquotation is not in _F of F--A_, but it is in _S-R fr_. The quotation\r\nis from _The Captain_ by John Fletcher and a collaborator, possibly\r\nMassinger. These lines from Act I, Sc. 3 are part of a speech by Lelia\r\naddressed to her lover. Later in the play Lelia attempts to seduce her\r\nfather--possibly a reason for Mary's selection of the lines.\r\n\r\n[26] At this point (f. 56 of the notebook) begins a long passage,\r\ncontinuing through Chapter V, in which Mary's emotional disturbance in\r\nwriting about the change in Mathilda's father (representing both\r\nShelley and Godwin?) shows itself on the pages of the MS. They look\r\nmore like the rough draft than the fair copy. There are numerous slips\r\nof the pen, corrections in phrasing and sentence structure, dashes\r\ninstead of other marks of punctuation, a large blot of ink on f. 57,\r\none major deletion (see note 32).\r\n\r\n[27] In the margin of _F of F--A_ Mary wrote, \"Lord B's Ch'de Harold.\"\r\nThe reference is to stanzas 71 and 72 of Canto IV. Byron compares the\r\nrainbow on the cataract first to \"Hope upon a death-bed\" and finally\r\n\r\nResembling, 'mid the torture of the scene, Love watching Madness with\r\nunalterable mien.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[28] In _F of F--A_ Mathilda \"took up Ariosto & read the story of\r\nIsabella.\" Mary's reason for the change is not clear. Perhaps she\r\nthought that the fate of Isabella, a tale of love and lust and death\r\n(though not of incest), was too close to what was to be Mathilda's\r\nfate. She may have felt--and rightly--that the allusions to Lelia and\r\nto Myrrha were ample foreshadowings. The reasons for the choice of the\r\nseventh canto of Book II of the _Faerie Queene_ may lie in the\r\nallegorical meaning of Guyon, or Temperance, and the \"dread and\r\nhorror\" of his experience.\r\n\r\n[29] With this speech, which is not in _F of F--A_, Mary begins to\r\ndevelop the character of the Steward, who later accompanies Mathilda\r\non her search for her father. Although he is to a very great extent\r\nthe stereptyped faithful servant, he does serve to dramatize the\r\nsituation both here and in the later scene.\r\n\r\n[30] This clause is substituted for a more conventional and less\r\ndramatic passage in _F of F--A_: \"& besides there appeared more of\r\nstruggle than remorse in his manner although sometimes I thought I saw\r\nglim[p]ses of the latter feeling in his tumultuous starts & gloomy\r\nlook.\"\r\n\r\n[31] These paragraphs beginning Chapter V are much expanded from _F of\r\nF--A_. Some of the details are in the _S-R fr_. This scene is recalled\r\nat the end of the story. (See page 80) Cf. what Mary says about places\r\nthat are associated with former emotions in her _Rambles in Germany\r\nand Italy_ (2 vols., London: Moxon, 1844), II, 78-79. She is writing\r\nof her approach to Venice, where, twenty-five years before, little\r\nClara had died. \"It is a strange, but to any person who has suffered,\r\na familiar circumstance, that those who are enduring mental or\r\ncorporeal agony are strangely alive to immediate external objects, and\r\ntheir imagination even exercises its wild power over them.... Thus the\r\nbanks of the Brenta presented to me a moving scene; not a palace, not\r\na tree of which I did not recognize, as marked and recorded, at a\r\nmoment when life and death hung upon our speedy arrival at Venice.\"\r\n\r\n[32] The remainder of this chapter, which describes the crucial scene\r\nbetween Mathilda and her father, is the result of much revision from\r\n_F of F--A_. Some of the revisions are in _S-R fr_. In general the\r\ntext of _Mathilda_ is improved in style. Mary adds concrete, specific\r\nwords and phrases; e.g., at the end of the first paragraph of\r\nMathilda's speech, the words \"of incertitude\" appear in _Mathilda_ for\r\nthe first time. She cancels, even in this final draft, an\r\nover-elaborate figure of speech after the words in the father's reply,\r\n\"implicated in my destruction\"; the cancelled passage is too flowery\r\nto be appropriate here: \"as if when a vulture is carrying off some\r\nhare it is struck by an arrow his helpless victim entangled in the\r\nsame fate is killed by the defeat of its enemy. One word would do all\r\nthis.\" Furthermore the revised text shows greater understanding and\r\npenetration of the feelings of both speakers: the addition of \"Am I\r\nthe cause of your grief?\" which brings out more dramatically what\r\nMathilda has said in the first part of this paragraph; the analysis of\r\nthe reasons for her presistent questioning; the addition of the final\r\nparagraph of her plea, \"Alas! Alas!... you hate me!\" which prepares\r\nfor the father's reply.\r\n\r\n[33] Almost all the final paragraph of the chapter is added to _F of\r\nF--A_. Three brief _S-R fr_ are much revised and simplified.\r\n\r\n[34] _Decameron_, 4th day, 1st story. Mary had read the _Decameron_ in\r\nMay, 1819. See _Journal_, p. 121.\r\n\r\n[35] The passage \"I should fear ... I must despair\" is in _S-R fr_ but\r\nnot in _F of F--A_. There, in the margin, is the following: \"Is it not\r\nthe prerogative of superior virtue to pardon the erring and to weigh\r\nwith mercy their offenses?\" This sentence does not appear in\r\n_Mathilda_. Also in the margin of _F of F--A_ is the number (9), the\r\nnumber of the _S-R fr_.\r\n\r\n[36] The passage \"enough of the world ... in unmixed delight\" is on a\r\nslip pasted over the middle of the page. Some of the obscured text is\r\nvisible in the margin, heavily scored out. Also in the margin is\r\n\"Canto IV Vers Ult,\" referring to the quotation from Dante's\r\n_Paradiso_. This quotation, with the preceding passage beginning \"in\r\nwhose eyes,\" appears in _Mathilda_ only.\r\n\r\n[37] The reference to Diana, with the father's rationalization of his\r\nlove for Mathilda, is in _S-R fr_ but not in _F of F--A_.\r\n\r\n[38] In _F of F--A_ this is followed by a series of other gloomy\r\nconcessive clauses which have been scored out to the advantage of the\r\ntext.\r\n\r\n[39] This paragraph has been greatly improved by the omission of\r\nelaborate over-statement; e.g., \"to pray for mercy & respite from my\r\nfear\" (_F of F--A_) becomes merely \"to pray.\"\r\n\r\n[40] This paragraph about the Steward is added in _Mathilda_. In _F of\r\nF--A_ he is called a servant and his name is Harry. See note 29.\r\n\r\n[41] This sentence, not in _F of F--A_, recalls Mathilda's dream.\r\n\r\n[42] This passage is somewhat more dramatic than that in _F of F--A_,\r\nputting what is there merely a descriptive statement into quotation\r\nmarks.\r\n\r\n[43] A stalactite grotto on the island of Antiparos in the Aegean Sea.\r\n\r\n[44] A good description of Mary's own behavior in England after\r\nShelley's death, of the surface placidity which concealed stormy\r\nemotion. See Nitchie, _Mary Shelley_, pp. 8-10.\r\n\r\n[45] _Job_, 17: 15-16, slightly misquoted.\r\n\r\n[46] Not in _F of F--A_. The quotation should read:\r\n\r\nFam. Whisper it, sister! so and so! In a dark hint, soft and slow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[47] The mother of Prince Arthur in Shakespeare's _King John_. In the\r\nMS the words \"the little Arthur\" are written in pencil above the name\r\nof Constance.\r\n\r\n[48] In _F of F--A_ this account of her plans is addressed to Diotima,\r\nand Mathilda's excuse for not detailing them is that they are too\r\ntrivial to interest spirits no longer on earth; this is the only\r\nintrusion of the framework into Mathilda's narrative in _The Fields of\r\nFancy_. Mathilda's refusal to recount her stratagems, though the\r\nomission is a welcome one to the reader, may represent the flagging of\r\nMary's invention. Similarly in _Frankenstein_ she offers excuses for\r\nnot explaining how the Monster was brought to life. The entire\r\npassage, \"Alas! I even now ... remain unfinished. I was,\" is on a slip\r\nof paper pasted on the page.\r\n\r\n[49] The comparison to a Hermitess and the wearing of the \"fanciful\r\nnunlike dress\" are appropriate though melodramatic. They appear only\r\nin _Mathilda_. Mathilda refers to her \"whimsical nunlike habit\" again\r\nafter she meets Woodville (see page 60) and tells us in a deleted\r\npassage that it was \"a close nunlike gown of black silk.\"\r\n\r\n[50] Cf. Shelley, _Prometheus Unbound_, I, 48: \"the wingless, crawling\r\nhours.\" This phrase (\"my part in submitting ... minutes\") and the\r\nremainder of the paragraph are an elaboration of the simple phrase in\r\n_F of F--A_, \"my part in enduring it--,\" with its ambiguous pronoun.\r\nThe last page of Chapter VIII shows many corrections, even in the MS\r\nof _Mathilda_. It is another passage that Mary seems to have written\r\nin some agitation of spirit. Cf. note 26.\r\n\r\n[51] In _F of F--A_ there are several false starts before this\r\nsentence. The name there is Welford; on the next page it becomes\r\nLovel, which is thereafter used throughout _The Fields of Fancy_ and\r\nappears twice, probably inadvertently, in _Mathilda_, where it is\r\ncrossed out. In a few of the _S-R fr_ it is Herbert. In _Mathilda_ it\r\nis at first Herbert, which is used until after the rewritten\r\nconclusion (see note 83) but is corrected throughout to Woodville. On\r\nthe final pages Woodville alone is used. (It is interesting, though\r\nnot particularly significant, that one of the minor characters in\r\nLamb's _John Woodvil_ is named Lovel. Such mellifluous names rolled\r\neasily from the pens of all the romantic writers.) This, her first\r\nportrait of Shelley in fiction, gave Mary considerable trouble:\r\nrevisions from the rough drafts are numerous. The passage on\r\nWoodville's endowment by fortune, for example, is much more concise\r\nand effective than that in _S-R fr_. Also Mary curbed somewhat the\r\nextravagance of her praise of Woodville, omitting such hyperboles as\r\n\"When he appeared a new sun seemed to rise on the day & he had all the\r\nbenignity of the dispensor of light,\" and \"he seemed to come as the\r\nGod of the world.\"\r\n\r\n[52] This passage beginning \"his station was too high\" is not in _F of\r\nF--A_.\r\n\r\n[53] This passage beginning \"He was a believer in the divinity of\r\ngenius\" is not in _F of F--A_. Cf. the discussion of genius in\r\n\"Giovanni Villani\" (Mary Shelley's essay in _The Liberal_, No. IV,\r\n1823), including the sentence: \"The fixed stars appear to abberate\r\n[_sic_]; but it is we that move, not they.\" It is tempting to conclude\r\nthat this is a quotation or echo of something which Shelley said,\r\nperhaps in conversation with Byron. I have not found it in any of his\r\npublished writings.\r\n\r\n[54] Is this wishful thinking about Shelley's poetry? It is well known\r\nthat a year later Mary remonstrated with Shelley about _The Witch of\r\nAtlas_, desiring, as she said in her 1839 note, \"that Shelley should\r\nincrease his popularity.... It was not only that I wished him to\r\nacquire popularity as redounding to his fame; but I believed that he\r\nwould obtain a greater mastery over his own powers, and greater\r\nhappiness in his mind, if public applause crowned his endeavours....\r\nEven now I believe that I was in the right.\" Shelley's response is in\r\nthe six introductory stanzas of the poem.\r\n\r\n[55] The preceding paragraphs about Elinor and Woodville are the\r\nresult of considerable revision for the better of _F of F--A_ and _S-R\r\nfr_. Mary scored out a paragraph describing Elinor, thus getting rid\r\nof several clich\u00e9s (\"fortune had smiled on her,\" \"a favourite of\r\nfortune,\" \"turning tears of misery to those of joy\"); she omitted a\r\nclause which offered a weak motivation of Elinor's father's will (the\r\npossibility of her marrying, while hardly more than a child, one of\r\nher guardian's sons); she curtailed the extravagance of a rhapsody on\r\nthe perfect happiness which Woodville and Elinor would have enjoyed.\r\n\r\n[56] The death scene is elaborated from _F of F--A_ and made more\r\nmelodramatic by the addition of Woodville's plea and of his vigil by\r\nthe death-bed.\r\n\r\n[57] _F of F--A_ ends here and _F of F--B_ resumes.\r\n\r\n[58] A similar passage about Mathilda's fears is cancelled in _F of\r\nF--B_ but it appears in revised form in _S-R fr_. There is also among\r\nthese fragments a long passage, not used in _Mathilda_, identifying\r\nWoodville as someone she had met in London. Mary was wise to discard\r\nit for the sake of her story. But the first part of it is interesting\r\nfor its correspondence with fact: \"I knew him when I first went to\r\nLondon with my father he was in the height of his glory &\r\nhappiness--Elinor was living & in her life he lived--I did not know\r\nher but he had been introduced to my father & had once or twice\r\nvisited us--I had then gazed with wonder on his beauty & listened to\r\nhim with delight--\" Shelley had visited Godwin more than \"once or\r\ntwice\" while Harriet was still living, and Mary had seen him. Of\r\ncourse she had seen Harriet too, in 1812, when she came with Shelley\r\nto call on Godwin. Elinor and Harriet, however, are completely unlike.\r\n\r\n[59] Here and on many succeeding pages, where Mathilda records the\r\nwords and opinions of Woodville, it is possible to hear the voice of\r\nShelley. This paragraph, which is much expanded from _F of F--B_, may\r\nbe compared with the discussion of good and evil in _Julian and\r\nMaddalo_ and with _Prometheus Unbound_ and _A Defence of Poetry_.\r\n\r\n[60] In the revision of this passage Mathilda's sense of her pollution\r\nis intensified; for example, by addition of \"infamy and guilt was\r\nmingled with my portion.\"\r\n\r\n[61] Some phrases of self-criticism are added in this paragraph.\r\n\r\n[62] In _F of F--B_ this quotation is used in the laudanum scene, just\r\nbefore Level's (Woodville's) long speech of dissuasion.\r\n\r\n[63] The passage \"air, & to suffer ... my compassionate friend\" is on\r\na slip of paper pasted across the page.\r\n\r\n[64] This phrase sustains the metaphor better than that in _F of\r\nF--B_: \"puts in a word.\"\r\n\r\n[65] This entire paragraph is added to _F of F--B_; it is in rough\r\ndraft in _S-R fr_.\r\n\r\n[66] This is changed in the MS of _Mathilda_ from \"a violent\r\nthunderstorm.\" Evidently Mary decided to avoid using another\r\nthunderstorm at a crisis in the story.\r\n\r\n[67] The passage \"It is true ... I will\" is on a slip of paper pasted\r\nacross the page.\r\n\r\n[68] In the revision from _F of F--B_ the style of this whole episode\r\nbecomes more concise and specific.\r\n\r\n[69] An improvement over the awkward phrasing in _F of F--B_: \"a\r\nfriend who will not repulse my request that he would accompany me.\"\r\n\r\n[70] These two paragraphs are not in _F of F--B_; portions of them are\r\nin _S-R fr_.\r\n\r\n[71] This speech is greatly improved in style over that in _F of\r\nF--B_, more concise in expression (though somewhat expanded), more\r\nspecific. There are no corresponding _S-R fr_ to show the process of\r\nrevision. With the ideas expressed here cf. Shelley, _Julian and\r\nMaddalo_, ll. 182-187, 494-499, and his letter to Claire in November,\r\n1820 (Julian _Works_, X, 226). See also White, _Shelley_, II, 378.\r\n\r\n[72] This solecism, copied from _F of F--B_, is not characteristic of\r\nMary Shelley.\r\n\r\n[73] This paragraph prepares for the eventual softening of Mathilda's\r\nfeeling. The idea is somewhat elaborated from _F of F--B_. Other\r\nchanges are necessitated by the change in the mode of presenting the\r\nstory. In _The Fields of Fancy_ Mathilda speaks as one who has already\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n[74] Cf. Shelley's emphasis on hope and its association with love in\r\nall his work. When Mary wrote _Mathilda_ she knew _Queen Mab_ (see\r\nPart VIII, ll. 50-57, and Part IX, ll. 207-208), the _Hymn to\r\nIntellectual Beauty_, and the first three acts of _Prometheus\r\nUnbound_. The fourth act was written in the winter of 1819, but\r\nDemogorgon's words may already have been at least adumbrated before\r\nthe beginning of November:\r\n\r\nTo love and bear, to hope till hope creates From its own wreck the\r\nthing it contemplates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[75] Shelley had written, \"Desolation is a delicate thing\"\r\n(_Prometheus Unbound_, Act I, l. 772) and called the Spirit of the\r\nEarth \"a delicate spirit\" (_Ibid._, Act III, Sc. iv, l. 6).\r\n\r\n[76] _Purgatorio_, Canto 28, ll. 31-33. Perhaps by this time Shelley\r\nhad translated ll. 1-51 of this canto. He had read the _Purgatorio_ in\r\nApril, 1818, and again with Mary in August, 1819, just as she was\r\nbeginning to write _Mathilda_. Shelley showed his translation to\r\nMedwin in 1820, but there seems to be no record of the date of\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n[77] An air with this title was published about 1800 in London by\r\nRobert Birchall. See _Catalogue of Printed Music Published between\r\n1487 and 1800 and now in the British Museum_, by W. Barclay Squire,\r\n1912. Neither author nor composer is listed in the _Catalogue_.\r\n\r\n[78] This paragraph is materially changed from _F of F--B_. Clouds and\r\ndarkness are substituted for starlight, silence for the sound of the\r\nwind. The weather here matches Mathilda's mood. Four and a half lines\r\nof verse (which I have not been able to identify, though they sound\r\nShelleyan--are they Mary's own?) are omitted: of the stars she says,\r\n\r\n                  the wind is in the tree\r\n  But they are silent;--still they roll along\r\n  Immeasurably distant; & the vault\r\n  Built round by those white clouds, enormous clouds\r\n  Still deepens its unfathomable depth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[79] If Mary quotes Coleridge's _Ancient Mariner_ intentionally here,\r\nshe is ironic, for this is no merciful rain, except for the fact that\r\nit brings on the illness which leads to Mathilda's death, for which\r\nshe longs.\r\n\r\n[80] This quotation from _Christabel_ (which suggests that the\r\npreceding echo is intentional) is not in _F of F--B_.\r\n\r\n[81] Cf. the description which opens _Mathilda_.\r\n\r\n[82] Among Lord Abinger's papers, in Mary's hand, are some comparable\r\n(but very bad) fragmentary verses addressed to Mother Earth.\r\n\r\n[83] At this point four sheets are cut out of the notebook. They are\r\nevidently those with pages numbered 217 to 223 which are among the\r\n_S-R fr_. They contain the conclusion of the story, ending, as does _F\r\nof F--B_ with Mathilda's words spoken to Diotima in the Elysian\r\nFields: \"I am here, not with my father, but listening to lessons of\r\nwisdom, which will one day bring me to him when we shall never part.\r\nTHE END.\" Some passages are scored out, but not this final sentence.\r\nTenses are changed from past to future. The name _Herbert_ is changed\r\nto _Woodville_. The explanation must be that Mary was hurrying to\r\nfinish the revision (quite drastic on these final pages) and the\r\ntranscription of her story before her confinement, and that in her\r\nhaste she copied the pages from _F of F--B_ as they stood. Then,\r\nrealizing that they did not fit _Mathilda_, she began to revise them;\r\nbut to keep her MS neat, she cut out these pages and wrote the fair\r\ncopy. There is no break in _Mathilda_ in story or in pagination. This\r\nfair copy also shows signs of haste: slips of the pen, repetition of\r\nwords, a number of unimportant revisions.\r\n\r\n[84] Here in _F of F--B_ there is an index number which evidently\r\npoints to a note at the bottom of the next page. The note is omitted\r\nin _Mathilda_. It reads:\r\n\r\n\"Dante in his Purgatorio describes a grifon as remaining unchanged but\r\nhis reflection in the eyes of Beatrice as perpetually varying (Purg.\r\nCant. 31) So nature is ever the same but seen differently by almost\r\nevery spectator and even by the same at various times. All minds, as\r\nmirrors, receive her forms--yet in each mirror the shapes apparently\r\nreflected vary & are perpetually changing--\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[85] See note 20. Mary Shelley had suffered this torture when Clara\r\nand William died.\r\n\r\n[86] See the end of Chapter V.\r\n\r\n[87] This sentence is not in _F of F--B_ or in _S-R fr_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIELDS OF FANCY[88]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in Rome--the Queen of the World that I suffered a misfortune\r\nthat reduced me to misery & despair[89]--The bright sun & deep azure\r\nsky were oppressive but nought was so hateful as the voice of Man--I\r\nloved to walk by the shores of the Tiber which were solitary & if the\r\nsirocco blew to see the swift clouds pass over St. Peters and the many\r\ndomes of Rome or if the sun shone I turned my eyes from the sky whose\r\nlight was too dazzling & gay to be reflected in my tearful eyes I\r\nturned them to the river whose swift course was as the speedy\r\ndeparture of happiness and whose turbid colour was gloomy as grief--\r\n\r\nWhether I slept I know not or whether it was in one of those many\r\nhours which I spent seated on the ground my mind a chaos of despair &\r\nmy eyes for ever wet by tears but I was here visited by a lovely\r\nspirit whom I have ever worshiped & who tried to repay my adoration by\r\ndiverting my mind from the hideous memories that racked it. At first\r\nindeed this wanton spirit played a false part & appearing with sable\r\nwings & gloomy countenance seemed to take a pleasure in exagerating\r\nall my miseries--and as small hopes arose to snatch them from me &\r\ngive me in their place gigantic fears which under her fairy hand\r\nappeared close, impending & unavoidable--sometimes she would cruelly\r\nleave me while I was thus on the verge of madness and without\r\nconsoling me leave me nought but heavy leaden sleep--but at other\r\ntimes she would wilily link less unpleasing thoughts to these most\r\ndreadful ones & before I was aware place hopes before me--futile but\r\nconsoling[90]--\r\n\r\nOne day this lovely spirit--whose name as she told me was Fantasia\r\ncame to me in one of her consolotary moods--her wings which seemed\r\ncoloured by her tone of mind were not gay but beautiful like that of\r\nthe partridge & her lovely eyes although they ever burned with an\r\nunquenshable fire were shaded & softened by her heavy lids & the black\r\nlong fringe of her eye lashes--She thus addressed me--You mourn for\r\nthe loss of those you love. They are gone for ever & great as my power\r\nis I cannot recall them to you--if indeed I wave my wand over you you\r\nwill fancy that you feel their gentle spirits in the soft air that\r\nsteals over your cheeks & the distant sound of winds & waters may\r\nimage to you their voices which will bid you rejoice for that they\r\nlive--This will not take away your grief but you will shed sweeter\r\ntears than those which full of anguish & hopelessness now start from\r\nyour eyes--This I can do & also can I take you to see many of my\r\nprovinces my fairy lands which you have not yet visited and whose\r\nbeauty will while away the heavy time--I have many lovely spots under\r\nmy command which poets of old have visited and have seen those sights\r\nthe relation of which has been as a revelation to the world--many\r\nspots I have still in keeping of lovely fields or horrid rocks peopled\r\nby the beautiful or the tremendous which I keep in reserve for my\r\nfuture worshippers--to one of those whose grim terrors frightened\r\nsleep from the eye I formerly led you[91] but you now need more\r\npleasing images & although I will not promise you to shew you any new\r\nscenes yet if I lead you to one often visited by my followers you will\r\nat least see new combinations that will sooth if they do not delight\r\nyou--Follow me--\r\n\r\nAlas! I replied--when have you found me slow to obey your voice--some\r\ntimes indeed I have called you & you have not come--but when before\r\nhave I not followed your slightest sign and have left what was either\r\nof joy or sorrow in our world to dwell with you in yours till you have\r\ndismissed me ever unwilling to depart--But now the weight of grief\r\nthat oppresses me takes from me that lightness which is necessary to\r\nfollow your quick & winged motions alas in the midst of my course one\r\nthought would make me droop to the ground while you would outspeed me\r\nto your Kingdom of Glory & leave me here darkling\r\n\r\nUngrateful! replied the Spirit Do I not tell you that I will sustain &\r\nconsole you My wings shall aid your heavy steps & I will command my\r\nwinds to disperse the mist that over casts you--I will lead you to a\r\nplace where you will not hear laughter that disturbs you or see the\r\nsun that dazzles you--We will choose some of the most sombre walks of\r\nthe Elysian fields--\r\n\r\nThe Elysian fields--I exclaimed with a quick scream--shall I then see?\r\nI gasped & could not ask that which I longed to know--the friendly\r\nspirit replied more gravely--I have told you that you will not see\r\nthose whom you mourn--But I must away--follow me or I must leave you\r\nweeping deserted by the spirit that now checks your tears--\r\n\r\nGo--I replied I cannot follow--I can only sit here & grieve--& long to\r\nsee those who are gone for ever for to nought but what has relation to\r\nthem can I listen--\r\n\r\nThe spirit left me to groan & weep to wish the sun quenched in eternal\r\ndarkness--to accuse the air the waters all--all the universe of my\r\nutter & irremediable misery--Fantasia came again and ever when she\r\ncame tempted me to follow her but as to follow her was to leave for a\r\nwhile the thought of those loved ones whose memories were my all\r\nalthough they were my torment I dared not go--Stay with me I cried &\r\nhelp me to clothe my bitter thoughts in lovelier colours give me hope\r\nalthough fallacious & images of what has been although it never will\r\nbe again--diversion I cannot take cruel fairy do you leave me alas all\r\nmy joy fades at thy departure but I may not follow thee--\r\n\r\nOne day after one of these combats when the spirit had left me I\r\nwandered on along the banks of the river to try to disperse the\r\nexcessive misery that I felt untill overcome by fatigue--my eyes\r\nweighed down by tears--I lay down under the shade of trees & fell\r\nasleep--I slept long and when I awoke I knew not where I was--I did\r\nnot see the river or the distant city--but I lay beside a lovely\r\nfountain shadowed over by willows & surrounded by blooming myrtles--at\r\na short distance the air seemed pierced by the spiry pines & cypresses\r\nand the ground was covered by short moss & sweet smelling heath--the\r\nsky was blue but not dazzling like that of Rome and on every side I\r\nsaw long allies--clusters of trees with intervening lawns & gently\r\nstealing rivers--Where am I? [I] exclaimed--& looking around me I\r\nbeheld Fantasia--She smiled & as she smiled all the enchanting scene\r\nappeared lovelier--rainbows played in the fountain & the heath flowers\r\nat our feet appeared as if just refreshed by dew--I have seized you,\r\nsaid she--as you slept and will for some little time retain you as my\r\nprisoner--I will introduce you to some of the inhabitants of these\r\npeaceful Gardens--It shall not be to any whose exuberant happiness\r\nwill form an u[n]pleasing contrast with your heavy grief but it shall\r\nbe to those whose chief care here is to acquired knowledged [_sic_] &\r\nvirtue--or to those who having just escaped from care & pain have not\r\nyet recovered full sense of enjoyment--This part of these Elysian\r\nGardens is devoted to those who as before in your world wished to\r\nbecome wise & virtuous by study & action here endeavour after the\r\nsame ends by contemplation--They are still unknowing of their final\r\ndestination but they have a clear knowledge of what on earth is only\r\nsupposed by some which is that their happiness now & hereafter depends\r\nupon their intellectual improvement--Nor do they only study the forms\r\nof this universe but search deeply in their own minds and love to meet\r\n& converse on all those high subjects of which the philosophers of\r\nAthens loved to treat--With deep feelings but with no outward\r\ncircumstances to excite their passions you will perhaps imagine that\r\ntheir life is uniform & dull--but these sages are of that disposition\r\nfitted to find wisdom in every thing & in every lovely colour or form\r\nideas that excite their love--Besides many years are consumed before\r\nthey arrive here--When a soul longing for knowledge & pining at its\r\nnarrow conceptions escapes from your earth many spirits wait to\r\nreceive it and to open its eyes to the mysteries of the universe--many\r\ncenturies are often consumed in these travels and they at last retire\r\nhere to digest their knowledge & to become still wiser by thought and\r\nimagination working upon memory [92]--When the fitting period is\r\naccomplished they leave this garden to inhabit another world fitted\r\nfor the reception of beings almost infinitely wise--but what this\r\nworld is neither can you conceive or I teach you--some of the spirits\r\nwhom you will see here are yet unknowing in the secrets of\r\nnature--They are those whom care & sorrow have consumed on earth &\r\nwhose hearts although active in virtue have been shut through\r\nsuffering from knowledge--These spend sometime here to recover their\r\nequanimity & to get a thirst of knowledge from converse with their\r\nwiser companions--They now securely hope to see again those whom they\r\nlove & know that it is ignorance alone that detains them from them. As\r\nfor those who in your world knew not the loveliness of benevolence &\r\njustice they are placed apart some claimed by the evil spirit & in\r\nvain sought for by the good but She whose delight is to reform the\r\nwicked takes all she can & delivers them to her ministers not to be\r\npunished but to be exercised & instructed untill acquiring a love of\r\nvirtue they are fitted for these gardens where they will acquire a\r\nlove of knowledge\r\n\r\nAs Fantasia talked I saw various groupes of figures as they walked\r\namong the allies of the gardens or were seated on the grassy plots\r\neither in contemplation or conversation several advanced together\r\ntowards the fountain where I sat--As they approached I observed the\r\nprincipal figure to be that of a woman about 40 years of age her eyes\r\nburned with a deep fire and every line of her face expressed\r\nenthusiasm & wisdom--Poetry seemed seated on her lips which were\r\nbeautifully formed & every motion of her limbs although not youthful\r\nwas inexpressibly graceful--her black hair was bound in tresses round\r\nher head and her brows were encompassed by a fillet--her dress was\r\nthat of a simple tunic bound at the waist by a broad girdle and a\r\nmantle which fell over her left arm she was encompassed by several\r\nyouths of both sexes who appeared to hang on her words & to catch the\r\ninspiration as it flowed from her with looks either of eager wonder or\r\nstedfast attention with eyes all bent towards her eloquent countenance\r\nwhich beamed with the mind within--I am going said Fantasia but I\r\nleave my spirit with you without which this scene wd fade away--I\r\nleave you in good company--that female whose eyes like the loveliest\r\nplanet in the heavens draw all to gaze on her is the Prophetess\r\nDiotima the instructress of Socrates[93]--The company about her are\r\nthose just escaped from the world there they were unthinking or\r\nmisconducted in the pursuit of knowledge. She leads them to truth &\r\nwisdom untill the time comes when they shall be fitted for the journey\r\nthrough the universe which all must one day undertake--farewell--\r\n\r\nAnd now, gentlest reader--I must beg your indulgence--I am a being too\r\nweak to record the words of Diotima her matchless wisdom & heavenly\r\neloquence[.] What I shall repeat will be as the faint shadow of a tree\r\nby moonlight--some what of the form will be preserved but there will\r\nbe no life in it--Plato alone of Mortals could record the thoughts of\r\nDiotima hopeless therefore I shall not dwell so much on her words as\r\non those of her pupils which being more earthly can better than hers\r\nbe related by living lips[.]\r\n\r\nDiotima approached the fountain & seated herself on a mossy mound near\r\nit and her disciples placed themselves on the grass near her--Without\r\nnoticing me who sat close under her she continued her discourse\r\naddressing as it happened one or other of her listeners--but before I\r\nattempt to repeat her words I will describe the chief of these whom\r\nshe appeared to wish principally to impress--One was a woman of about\r\n23 years of age in the full enjoyment of the most exquisite beauty her\r\ngolden hair floated in ringlets on her shoulders--her hazle eyes were\r\nshaded by heavy lids and her mouth the lips apart seemed to breathe\r\nsensibility[94]--But she appeared thoughtful & unhappy--her cheek was\r\npale she seemed as if accustomed to suffer and as if the lessons she\r\nnow heard were the only words of wisdom to which she had ever\r\nlistened--The youth beside her had a far different aspect--his form\r\nwas emaciated nearly to a shadow--his features were handsome but thin\r\n& worn--& his eyes glistened as if animating the visage of decay--his\r\nforehead was expansive but there was a doubt & perplexity in his looks\r\nthat seemed to say that although he had sought wisdom he had got\r\nentangled in some mysterious mazes from which he in vain endeavoured\r\nto extricate himself--As Diotima spoke his colour went & came with\r\nquick changes & the flexible muscles of his countenance shewed every\r\nimpression that his mind received--he seemed one who in life had\r\nstudied hard but whose feeble frame sunk beneath the weight of the\r\nmere exertion of life--the spark of intelligence burned with uncommon\r\nstrength within him but that of life seemed ever on the eve of\r\nfading[95]--At present I shall not describe any other of this groupe\r\nbut with deep attention try to recall in my memory some of the words\r\nof Diotima--they were words of fire but their path is faintly marked\r\non my recollection--[96]\r\n\r\nIt requires a just hand, said she continuing her discourse, to weigh &\r\ndivide the good from evil--On the earth they are inextricably\r\nentangled and if you would cast away what there appears an evil a\r\nmultitude of beneficial causes or effects cling to it & mock your\r\nlabour--When I was on earth and have walked in a solitary country\r\nduring the silence of night & have beheld the multitude of stars, the\r\nsoft radiance of the moon reflected on the sea, which was studded by\r\nlovely islands--When I have felt the soft breeze steal across my cheek\r\n& as the words of love it has soothed & cherished me--then my mind\r\nseemed almost to quit the body that confined it to the earth & with a\r\nquick mental sense to mingle with the scene that I hardly saw--I\r\nfelt--Then I have exclaimed, oh world how beautiful thou art!--Oh\r\nbrightest universe behold thy worshiper!--spirit of beauty & of\r\nsympathy which pervades all things, & now lifts my soul as with wings,\r\nhow have you animated the light & the breezes!--Deep & inexplicable\r\nspirit give me words to express my adoration; my mind is hurried away\r\nbut with language I cannot tell how I feel thy loveliness! Silence or\r\nthe song of the nightingale the momentary apparition of some bird that\r\nflies quietly past--all seems animated with thee & more than all the\r\ndeep sky studded with worlds!\"--If the winds roared & tore the sea and\r\nthe dreadful lightnings seemed falling around me--still love was\r\nmingled with the sacred terror I felt; the majesty of loveliness was\r\ndeeply impressed on me--So also I have felt when I have seen a lovely\r\ncountenance--or heard solemn music or the eloquence of divine wisdom\r\nflowing from the lips of one of its worshippers--a lovely animal or\r\neven the graceful undulations of trees & inanimate objects have\r\nexcited in me the same deep feeling of love & beauty; a feeling which\r\nwhile it made me alive & eager to seek the cause & animator of the\r\nscene, yet satisfied me by its very depth as if I had already found\r\nthe solution to my enquires [_sic_] & as if in feeling myself a part\r\nof the great whole I had found the truth & secret of the universe--But\r\nwhen retired in my cell I have studied & contemplated the various\r\nmotions and actions in the world the weight of evil has confounded\r\nme--If I thought of the creation I saw an eternal chain of evil linked\r\none to the other--from the great whale who in the sea swallows &\r\ndestroys multitudes & the smaller fish that live on him also & torment\r\nhim to madness--to the cat whose pleasure it is to torment her prey I\r\nsaw the whole creation filled with pain--each creature seems to exist\r\nthrough the misery of another & death & havoc is the watchword of the\r\nanimated world--And Man also--even in Athens the most civilized spot\r\non the earth what a multitude of mean passions--envy, malice--a\r\nrestless desire to depreciate all that was great and good did I\r\nsee--And in the dominions of the great being I saw man [reduced?][97]\r\nfar below the animals of the field preying on one anothers [_sic_]\r\nhearts; happy in the downfall of others--themselves holding on with\r\nbent necks and cruel eyes to a wretch more a slave if possible than\r\nthey to his miserable passions--And if I said these are the\r\nconsequences of civilization & turned to the savage world I saw only\r\nignorance unrepaid by any noble feeling--a mere animal, love of life\r\njoined to a low love of power & a fiendish love of destruction--I saw\r\na creature drawn on by his senses & his selfish passions but untouched\r\nby aught noble or even Human--\r\n\r\nAnd then when I sought for consolation in the various faculties man is\r\npossessed of & which I felt burning within me--I found that spirit of\r\nunion with love & beauty which formed my happiness & pride degraded\r\ninto superstition & turned from its natural growth which could bring\r\nforth only good fruit:--cruelty--& intolerance & hard tyranny was\r\ngrafted on its trunk & from it sprung fruit suitable to such\r\ngrafts--If I mingled with my fellow creatures was the voice I heard\r\nthat of love & virtue or that of selfishness & vice, still misery was\r\never joined to it & the tears of mankind formed a vast sea ever blown\r\non by its sighs & seldom illuminated by its smiles--Such taking only\r\none side of the picture & shutting wisdom from the view is a just\r\nportraiture of the creation as seen on earth\r\n\r\nBut when I compared the good & evil of the world & wished to divide\r\nthem into two seperate principles I found them inextricably intwined\r\ntogether & I was again cast into perplexity & doubt--I might have\r\nconsidered the earth as an imperfect formation where having bad\r\nmaterials to work on the Creator could only palliate the evil effects\r\nof his combinations but I saw a wanton malignity in many parts &\r\nparticularly in the mind of man that baffled me a delight in mischief\r\na love of evil for evils sake--a siding of the multitude--a dastardly\r\napplause which in their hearts the crowd gave to triumphant\r\nwick[ed]ness over lowly virtue that filled me with painful sensations.\r\nMeditation, painful & continual thought only encreased my doubts--I\r\ndared not commit the blasphemy of ascribing the slightest evil to a\r\nbeneficent God--To whom then should I ascribe the creation? To two\r\nprinciples? Which was the upermost? They were certainly independant\r\nfor neither could the good spirit allow the existence of evil or the\r\nevil one the existence of good--Tired of these doubts to which I could\r\nform no probable solution--Sick of forming theories which I destroyed\r\nas quickly as I built them I was one evening on the top of Hymettus\r\nbeholding the lovely prospect as the sun set in the glowing sea--I\r\nlooked towards Athens & in my heart I exclaimed--oh busy hive of men!\r\nWhat heroism & what meaness exists within thy walls! And alas! both to\r\nthe good & to the wicked what incalculable misery--Freemen ye call\r\nyourselves yet every free man has ten slaves to build up his\r\nfreedom--and these slaves are men as they are yet d[e]graded by their\r\nstation to all that is mean & loathsome--Yet in how many hearts now\r\nbeating in that city do high thoughts live & magnanimity that should\r\nmethinks redeem the whole human race--What though the good man is\r\nunhappy has he not that in his heart to satisfy him? And will a\r\ncontented conscience compensate for fallen hopes--a slandered name\r\ntorn affections & all the miseries of civilized life?--\r\n\r\nOh Sun how beautiful thou art! And how glorious is the golden ocean\r\nthat receives thee! My heart is at peace--I feel no sorrow--a holy\r\nlove stills my senses--I feel as if my mind also partook of the\r\ninexpressible loveliness of surrounding nature--What shall I do? Shall\r\nI disturb this calm by mingling in the world?--shall I with an aching\r\nheart seek the spectacle of misery to discover its cause or shall I\r\nhopless leave the search of knowledge & devote myself to the pleasures\r\nthey say this world affords?--Oh! no--I will become wise! I will study\r\nmy own heart--and there discovering as I may the spring of the virtues\r\nI possess I will teach others how to look for them in their own\r\nsouls--I will find whence arrises this unquenshable love of beauty I\r\npossess that seems the ruling star of my life--I will learn how I may\r\ndirect it aright and by what loving I may become more like that beauty\r\nwhich I adore And when I have traced the steps of the godlike feeling\r\nwhich ennobles me & makes me that which I esteem myself to be then I\r\nwill teach others & if I gain but one proselyte--if I can teach but\r\none other mind what is the beauty which they ought to love--and what\r\nis the sympathy to which they ought to aspire what is the true end of\r\ntheir being--which must be the true end of that of all men then shall\r\nI be satisfied & think I have done enough--\r\n\r\nFarewell doubts--painful meditation of evil--& the great, ever\r\ninexplicable cause of all that we see--I am content to be ignorant of\r\nall this happy that not resting my mind on any unstable theories I\r\nhave come to the conclusion that of the great secret of the universe I\r\n_can know nothing_--There is a veil before it--my eyes are not\r\npiercing enough to see through it my arms not long enough to reach it\r\nto withdraw it--I will study the end of my being--oh thou universal\r\nlove inspire me--oh thou beauty which I see glowing around me lift me\r\nto a fit understanding of thee! Such was the conclusion of my long\r\nwanderings I sought the end of my being & I found it to be knowledge\r\nof itself--Nor think this a confined study--Not only did it lead me to\r\nsearch the mazes of the human soul--but I found that there existed\r\nnought on earth which contained not a part of that universal beauty\r\nwith which it [was] my aim & object to become acquainted--the motions\r\nof the stars of heaven the study of all that philosophers have\r\nunfolded of wondrous in nature became as it where [_sic_] the steps by\r\nwhich my soul rose to the full contemplation & enjoyment of the\r\nbeautiful--Oh ye who have just escaped from the world ye know not\r\nwhat fountains of love will be opened in your hearts or what exquisite\r\ndelight your minds will receive when the secrets of the world will be\r\nunfolded to you and ye shall become acquainted with the beauty of the\r\nuniverse--Your souls now growing eager for the acquirement of\r\nknowledge will then rest in its possession disengaged from every\r\nparticle of evil and knowing all things ye will as it were be mingled\r\nin the universe & ye will become a part of that celestial beauty that\r\nyou admire--[98]\r\n\r\nDiotima ceased and a profound silence ensued--the youth with his\r\ncheeks flushed and his eyes burning with the fire communicated from\r\nhers still fixed them on her face which was lifted to heaven as in\r\ninspiration--The lovely female bent hers to the ground & after a deep\r\nsigh was the first to break the silence--\r\n\r\nOh divinest prophetess, said she--how new & to me how strange are your\r\nlessons--If such be the end of our being how wayward a course did I\r\npursue on earth--Diotima you know not how torn affections & misery\r\nincalculable misery--withers up the soul. How petty do the actions of\r\nour earthly life appear when the whole universe is opened to our\r\ngaze--yet there our passions are deep & irrisisbable [_sic_] and as we\r\nare floating hopless yet clinging to hope down the impetuous stream\r\ncan we perceive the beauty of its banks which alas my soul was too\r\nturbid to reflect--If knowledge is the end of our being why are\r\npassions & feelings implanted in us that hurries [_sic_] us from\r\nwisdom to selfconcentrated misery & narrow selfish feeling? Is it as a\r\ntrial? On earth I thought that I had well fulfilled my trial & my last\r\nmoments became peaceful with the reflection that I deserved no\r\nblame--but you take from me that feeling--My passions were there my\r\nall to me and the hopeless misery that possessed me shut all love &\r\nall images of beauty from my soul--Nature was to me as the blackest\r\nnight & if rays of loveliness ever strayed into my darkness it was\r\nonly to draw bitter tears of hopeless anguish from my eyes--Oh on\r\nearth what consolation is there to misery?\r\n\r\nYour heart I fear, replied Diotima, was broken by your sufferings--but\r\nif you had struggled--if when you found all hope of earthly happiness\r\nwither within you while desire of it scorched your soul--if you had\r\nnear you a friend to have raised you to the contemplation of beauty &\r\nthe search of knowledge you would have found perhaps not new hopes\r\nspring within you but a new life distinct from that of passion by\r\nwhich you had before existed[99]--relate to me what this misery was\r\nthat thus engroses you--tell me what were the vicissitudes of feeling\r\nthat you endured on earth--after death our actions & worldly interest\r\nfade as nothing before us but the traces of our feelings exist & the\r\nmemories of those are what furnish us here with eternal subject of\r\nmeditation.\r\n\r\nA blush spread over the cheek of the lovely girl--Alas, replied she\r\nwhat a tale must I relate what dark & phre[n]zied passions must I\r\nunfold--When you Diotima lived on earth your soul seemed to mingle in\r\nlove only with its own essence & to be unknowing of the various\r\ntortures which that heart endures who if it has not sympathized with\r\nhas been witness of the dreadful struggles of a soul enchained by dark\r\ndeep passions which were its hell & yet from which it could not\r\nescape--Are there in the peaceful language used by the inhabitants of\r\nthese regions--words burning enough to paint the tortures of the human\r\nheart--Can you understand them? or can you in any way sympathize with\r\nthem--alas though dead I do and my tears flow as when I lived when my\r\nmemory recalls the dreadful images of the past--\r\n\r\n--As the lovely girl spoke my own eyes filled with bitter drops--the\r\nspirit of Fantasia seemed to fade from within me and when after\r\nplacing my hand before my swimming eyes I withdrew it again I found\r\nmyself under the trees on the banks of the Tiber--The sun was just\r\nsetting & tinging with crimson the clouds that floated over St.\r\nPeters--all was still no human voice was heard--the very air was quiet\r\nI rose--& bewildered with the grief that I felt within me the\r\nrecollection of what I had heard--I hastened to the city that I might\r\nsee human beings not that I might forget my wandering recollections\r\nbut that I might impress on my mind what was reality & what was either\r\ndream--or at least not of this earth--The Corso of Rome was filled\r\nwith carriages and as I walked up the Trinita dei' Montes I became\r\ndisgusted with the crowd that I saw about me & the vacancy & want of\r\nbeauty not to say deformity of the many beings who meaninglessly\r\nbuzzed about me--I hastened to my room which overlooked the whole city\r\nwhich as night came on became tranquil--Silent lovely Rome I now gaze\r\non thee--thy domes are illuminated by the moon--and the ghosts of\r\nlovely memories float with the night breeze among thy ruins--\r\ncontemplating thy loveliness which half soothes my miserable heart I\r\nrecord what I have seen--Tomorrow I will again woo Fantasia to lead me\r\nto the same walks & invite her to visit me with her visions which I\r\nbefore neglected--Oh let me learn this lesson while yet it may be\r\nuseful to me that to a mind hopeless & unhappy as mine--a moment of\r\nforgetfullness a moment [in] which it can pass out of itself is worth\r\na life of painful recollection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning while sitting on the steps of the temple of\r\nAesculapius in the Borghese gardens Fantasia again visited me &\r\nsmilingly beckoned to me to follow her--My flight was at first heavy\r\nbut the breezes commanded by the spirit to convoy me grew stronger as\r\nI advanced--a pleasing languour seized my senses & when I recovered I\r\nfound my self by the Elysian fountain near Diotima--The beautiful\r\nfemale who[m] I had left on the point of narrating her earthly history\r\nseemed to have waited for my return and as soon as I appeared she\r\nspoke thus--[100]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO _THE FIELDS OF FANCY_\r\n\r\n\r\n[88] Here is printed the opening of _F of F--A_, which contains the\r\nfanciful framework abandoned in _Mathilda_. It has some intrinsic\r\ninterest, as it shows that Mary as well as Shelley had been reading\r\nPlato, and especially as it reveals the close connection of the\r\nwriting of _Mathilda_ with Mary's own grief and depression. The first\r\nchapter is a fairly good rough draft. Punctuation, to be sure,\r\nconsists largely of dashes or is non-existent, and there are some\r\ncorrections. But there are not as many changes as there are in the\r\nremainder of this MS or in _F of F--B_.\r\n\r\n[89] It was in Rome that Mary's oldest child, William, died on June 7,\r\n1819.\r\n\r\n[90] Cf. two entries in Mary Shelley's journal. An unpublished entry\r\nfor October 27, 1822, reads: \"Before when I wrote Mathilda, miserable\r\nas I was, the inspiration was sufficient to quell my wretchedness\r\ntemporarily.\" Another entry, that for December 2, 1834, is quoted in\r\nabbreviated and somewhat garbled form by R. Glynn Grylls in _Mary\r\nShelley_ (London: Oxford University Press, 1938), p. 194, and\r\nreprinted by Professor Jones (_Journal_, p. 203). The full passage\r\nfollows: \"Little harm has my imagination done to me & how much\r\ngood!--My poor heart pierced through & through has found balm from\r\nit--it has been the aegis to my sensibility--Sometimes there have been\r\nperiods when Misery has pushed it aside--& those indeed were periods I\r\nshudder to remember--but the fairy only stept aside, she watched her\r\ntime--& at the first opportunity her ... beaming face peeped in, & the\r\nweight of deadly woe was lightened.\"\r\n\r\n[91] An obvious reference to _Frankenstein_.\r\n\r\n[92] With the words of Fantasia (and those of Diotima), cf. the\r\nassociation of wisdom and virtue in Plato's _Phaedo_, the myth of Er\r\nin the _Republic_, and the doctrine of love and beauty in the\r\n_Symposium_.\r\n\r\n[93] See Plato's _Symposium_. According to Mary's note in her edition\r\nof Shelley's _Essays, Letters from Abroad, etc_. (1840), Shelley\r\nplanned to use the name for the instructress of the Stranger in his\r\nunfinished prose tale, _The Coliseum_, which was written before\r\n_Mathilda_, in the winter of 1818-1819. Probably at this same time\r\nMary was writing an unfinished (and unpublished) tale about Valerius,\r\nan ancient Roman brought back to life in modern Rome. Valerius, like\r\nShelley's Stranger, was instructed by a woman whom he met in the\r\nColiseum. Mary's story is indebted to Shelley's in other ways as well.\r\n\r\n[94] Mathilda.\r\n\r\n[95] I cannot find a prototype for this young man, though in some ways\r\nhe resembles Shelley.\r\n\r\n[96] Following this paragraph is an incomplete one which is scored out\r\nin the MS. The comment on the intricacy of modern life is interesting.\r\nMary wrote: \"The world you have just quitted she said is one of doubt\r\n& perplexity often of pain & misery--The modes of suffering seem to\r\nme to be much multiplied there since I made one of the throng &\r\nmodern feelings seem to have acquired an intracacy then unknown but\r\nnow the veil is torn aside--the events that you felt deeply on earth\r\nhave passed away & you see them in their nakedness all but your\r\nknowledge & affections have passed away as a dream you now wonder at\r\nthe effect trifles had on you and that the events of so passing a\r\nscene should have interested you so deeply--You complain, my friends\r\nof the\"\r\n\r\n[97] The word is blotted and virtually illegible.\r\n\r\n[98] With Diotima's conclusion here cf. her words in the _Symposium_:\r\n\"When any one ascending from a correct system of Love, begins to\r\ncontemplate this supreme beauty, he already touches the consummation\r\nof his labour. For such as discipline themselves upon this system, or\r\nare conducted by another beginning to ascend through these transitory\r\nobjects which are beautiful, towards that which is beauty itself,\r\nproceeding as on steps from the love of one form to that of two, and\r\nfrom that of two, to that of all forms which are beautiful; and from\r\nbeautiful forms to beautiful habits and institutions, and from\r\ninstitutions to beautiful doctrines; until, from the meditation of\r\nmany doctrines, they arrive at that which is nothing else than the\r\ndoctrine of the supreme beauty itself, in the knowledge and\r\ncontemplation of which at length they repose.\" (Shelley's translation)\r\nLove, beauty, and self-knowledge are keywords not only in Plato but in\r\nShelley's thought and poetry, and he was much concerned with the\r\nproblem of the presence of good and evil. Some of these themes are\r\ndiscussed by Woodville in _Mathilda_. The repetition may have been one\r\nreason why Mary discarded the framework.\r\n\r\n[99] Mathilda did have such a friend, but, as she admits, she profited\r\nlittle from his teachings.\r\n\r\n[100] In _F of F--B_ there is another, longer version (three and a\r\nhalf pages) of this incident, scored out, recounting the author's\r\nreturn to the Elysian gardens, Diotima's consolation of Mathilda, and\r\nher request for Mathilda's story. After wandering through the alleys\r\nand woods adjacent to the gardens, the author came upon Diotima seated\r\nbeside Mathilda. \"It is true indeed she said our affections outlive\r\nour earthly forms and I can well sympathize in your disappointment\r\nthat you do not find what you loved in the life now ended to welcome\r\nyou here[.] But one day you will all meet how soon entirely depends\r\nupon yourself--It is by the acquirement of wisdom and the loss of the\r\nselfishness that is now attached to the sole feeling that possesses\r\nyou that you will at last mingle in that universal world of which we\r\nall now make a divided part.\" Diotima urges Mathilda to tell her\r\nstory, and she, hoping that by doing so she will break the bonds that\r\nweigh heavily upon her, proceeds to \"tell this history of strange\r\nwoe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Mathilda, by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MATHILDA ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 15238-8.txt or 15238-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/1/5/2/3/15238/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Starner, Cori Samuel and the Online Distributed\r\nProofreading Team.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n",

A rush of fear--a sense of\r\nill, made her heart palpitate as she opened her eyes to the light of\r\nday. While she was striving to recall her thoughts, and to remember what\r\nthe evil was with which she was threatened, again the servant tapped at\r\nher door, to say that Saunders had returned, and to deliver the letter\r\nhe had brought. She looked at her watch: it was past ten o'clock. She\r\nfelt glad that it had grown so late, and she not disturbed: yet as she\r\ntook the letter brought to her from her husband, all her tremor\r\nreturned; and she read it with agitation, as if it contained the\r\nannouncement of her final doom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You send me disagreeable tidings, my sweet Ethel,\" wrote Villiers,--\"I\r\nhope unfounded; but caution is necessary: I shall not, therefore, come\r\nto Duke Street. Send me a few lines, by Saunders, to tell me if any\r\nthing has happened. If what he apprehended has really taken place, you\r\nmust bear, my love, the separation of a day. You do not understand these\r\nthings, and will wonder when I tell you, that when the clock strikes\r\ntwelve on Saturday night, the magic spells and potent charms of\r\nSaunders's friends cease to have power: at that hour I shall be restored\r\nto you. Wait till then--and _then_ we will consult for the future. Have\r\npatience, dearest love: you have wedded poverty, hardship, and\r\nannoyance; but, joined to these, is the fondest, the most faithful heart\r\nin the world;--a heart you deign to prize, so I will not repine at ill\r\nfortune. Adieu, till this evening;--and then, as Belvidera says,\r\n'Remember twelve!'\r\n\r\n\"_Saturday Morning._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter reading these lines, Ethel dressed herself hastily. Fanny Derham\r\nhad already asked permission to see her; and she found her waiting in\r\nher sitting-room. It was an unspeakable comfort to have one as\r\nintelligent and kind as Fanny, to communicate with, during Edward's\r\nabsence. The soft, pleading eyes of Ethel asked her for comfort and\r\ncounsel; and, in spite of her extreme youth, the benignant and\r\nintelligent expression of Fanny's countenance promised both.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to say,\" she said, \"that Saunders's prognostics are too\r\ntrue. Such men as he describes have been here this morning. They were\r\ntolerably civil, and I convinced them, with greater ease than I had\r\nhoped, that Mr. Villiers was absent from the house; and I assured them,\r\nthat after this visit of theirs, he was not likely to return.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you really believe that they were\"--Ethel faltered.\r\n\r\n\"Bailiffs? Assuredly,\" replied Fanny: \"they told me that they had the\r\npower to search the house; but if they were 'strong,' they were also\r\n'merciful.' And now, what do you do? Saunders tells me he is waiting to\r\ntake back a letter to Mr. Villiers, at the London Coffee House. Write\r\nquickly, while I make your breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nEthel gladly obeyed. She wrote a few words to her husband. That it was\r\nalready Saturday, cheered her: twelve at night would soon come.\r\n\r\nAfter her note was dispatched, she addressed Fanny. \"What trouble I\r\ngive,\" she said: \"what will your mother think of such degrading\r\nproceedings?\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother,\" said Fanny, \"is the kindest-hearted woman in the world. We\r\nhave never exactly suffered this disaster; but we are in a rank of life\r\nwhich causes us to be brought into contact with such among our friends\r\nand relations; and she is familiar with trouble in almost all shapes.\r\nYou are a great favourite of hers; and now that she can claim a sort of\r\nacquaintance, she will be heart and soul your friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is odd,\" observed Ethel, \"that she never mentioned you to me. Had\r\nthe name of Fanny been mentioned, I should have recollected who Mrs.\r\nDerham was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not,\" said Fanny; \"it would have required a great effort of the\r\nimagination to have fancied Mrs. Derham the wife of my father. You never\r\nknew him; but Lord Lodore made you familiar with his qualities: the most\r\nshrinking susceptibility to the world's scorn, joined to the most entire\r\nabstraction from all that is vulgar; a morbid sensibility and delicate\r\nhealth placed him in glaring contrast with my mother. They never in the\r\nleast assimilated; and her character has gained in excellence since his\r\nloss. Before she was fretted and galled by his finer feelings--now she\r\ncan be good in her own way. Nothing reminds her of his exalted\r\nsentiments, except myself; and she is willing enough to forget me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you do not repine?\" asked her friend.\r\n\r\n\"I do not: she is happy in and with Sarah. I should spoil their notions\r\nof comfort, did I mingle with them;--they would torture and destroy me,\r\ndid they interfere with me. I lost my guide, preserver, my guardian\r\nangel, when my father died. Nothing remains but the philosophy which he\r\ntaught me--the disdain of low-thoughted care which he sedulously\r\ncultivated: this, joined to my cherished independence, which my\r\ndisposition renders necessary to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And thus you foster sorrow, and waste your life in vain regrets?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me! I do not waste my life,\" replied Fanny, with her sunny\r\nsmile;--\"nor am I unhappy--far otherwise. An ardent thirst for\r\nknowledge, is as the air I breathe; and the acquisition of it, is pure\r\nand unalloyed happiness. I aspire to be useful to my fellow-creatures:\r\nbut that is a consideration for the future, when fortune shall smile on\r\nme; now I have but one passion; it swallows up every other; it dwells\r\nwith my darling books, and is fed by the treasures of beauty and wisdom\r\nwhich they contain.\"\r\n\r\nEthel could not understand. Fanny continued:--\"I aspire to be\r\nuseful;--sometimes I think I am--once I know I was. I was my father's\r\nalmoner.\r\n\r\n\"We lived in a district where there was a great deal of distress, and a\r\ngreat deal of oppression. We had no money to give, but I soon found that\r\ndetermination and earnestness will do much. Is was my father's lesson,\r\nthat I should never fear any thing but myself. He taught me to\r\npenetrate, to anatomize, to purify my motives; but once assured of my\r\nown integrity, to be afraid of nothing. Words have more power than any\r\none can guess; it is by words that the world's great fight, now in these\r\ncivilized times, is carried on; I never hesitated to use them, when I\r\nfought any battle for the miserable and oppressed. People are so afraid\r\nto speak, it would seem as if half our fellow-creatures were born with\r\ndeficient organs; like parrots they can repeat a lesson, but their voice\r\nfails them, when that alone is wanting to make the tyrant quail.\"\r\n\r\nAs Fanny spoke, her blue eyes brightened, and a smile irradiated her\r\nface; these were all the tokens of enthusiasm she displayed, yet her\r\nwords moved Ethel strangely, and she looked on her with wonder as a\r\nsuperior being. Her youth gave grace to her sentiments, and were an\r\nassurance of their sincerity. She continued:--\r\n\r\n\"I am becoming flightly, as my mother calls it; but, as I spoke, many\r\nscenes of cottage distress passed through my memory, when, holding my\r\nfather's hand, I witnessed his endeavours to relieve the poor. That is\r\nall over now--he is gone, and I have but one consolation--that of\r\nendeavouring to render myself worthy to rejoin him in a better world. It\r\nis this hope that impels me continually and without any flagging of\r\nspirit, to cultivate my understanding and to refine it. O what has this\r\nlife to give, as worldlings describe it, worth one of those glorious\r\nemotions, which raise me from this petty sphere, into the sun-bright\r\nregions of mind, which my father inhabits! I am rewarded even here by\r\nthe elevated feelings which the authors, whom I love so passionately,\r\ninspire; while I converse each day with Plato, and Cicero, and\r\nEpictetus, the world, as it is, passes from before me like a vain\r\nshadow.\"\r\n\r\nThese enthusiastic words were spoken with so calm a manner, and in so\r\nequable a voice, that there seemed nothing strange nor exaggerated in\r\nthem. It is vanity and affectation that shock, or any manifestation of\r\nfeeling not in accordance with the real character. But while we follow\r\nour natural bent, and only speak that which our minds spontaneously\r\ninspire, there is a harmony, which, however novel, is never grating.\r\nFanny Derham spoke of things, which, to use her own expression, were to\r\nher as the air she breathed, and the simplicity of her manner entirely\r\nobviated the wonder which the energy of her expressions might occasion.\r\n\r\nSuch a woman as Fanny was more made to be loved by her own sex than by\r\nthe opposite one. Superiority of intellect, joined to acquisitions\r\nbeyond those usual even to men; and both announced with frankness,\r\nthough without pretension, forms a kind of anomaly little in accord with\r\nmasculine taste. Fanny could not be the rival of women, and, therefore,\r\nall her merits were appreciated by them. They love to look up to a\r\nsuperior being, to rest on a firmer support than their own minds can\r\nafford; and they are glad to find such in one of their own sex, and thus\r\ndestitute of those dangers which usually attend any services conferred\r\nby men.\r\n\r\nFrom talk like this, they diverged to subjects nearer to the heart of\r\nEthel. They spoke of Lord Lodore, and her father's name soothed her\r\nagitation even more than the consolatory arguments of her friend. She\r\nremembered how often he had talked of the trials to which the constancy of\r\nher temper and the truth of her affection might be put, and she felt her\r\ncourage rise to encounter those now before her, without discontent, or\r\nrather with that cheerful fortitude, which sheds grace over the rugged\r\nform of adversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marian._ Could you so long be absent?\r\n_Robin._ What a week?\r\nWas that so long?\r\n_Marian._ How long are lovers' weeks,\r\nDo you think, Robin, when they are asunder?\r\nAre they not pris'ners' years?\r\n\r\nBEN JONSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day passed on more lightly than Ethel could have hoped; much of it\r\nindeed was gone before she opened her eyes to greet it. Night soon\r\nclosed in, and she busied herself with arrangements for the welcome of\r\nher husband. Fanny loved solitude too well herself not to believe that\r\nothers shared her taste. She retired therefore when evening commenced.\r\nNo sooner was Ethel alone, than every image except Edward's passed out\r\nof her mind. Her heart was bursting with affection. Every other idea and\r\nthought, to use a chemical expression, was held in solution by that\r\npowerful feeling, which mingled and united with every particle of her\r\nsoul. She could not write nor read; if she attempted, before she had\r\nfinished the shortest sentence, she found that her understanding was\r\nwandering, and she re-read it with no better success. It was as if a\r\nspring, a gush from the fountain of love poured itself in, bearing away\r\nevery object which she strove to throw upon the stream of thought, till\r\nits own sweet waters alone filled the channel through which it flowed.\r\nShe gave herself up to the bewildering influence, and almost forgot to\r\ncount the hours till Edward's expected arrival. At last it was ten\r\no'clock, and then the sting of impatience and uncertainty was felt. It\r\nappeared to her as if a whole age had passed since she had seen or heard\r\nof him--as if countless events and incalculable changes might have taken\r\nplace. She read again and again his note, to assure herself that she\r\nmight really expect him: the minutes meanwhile stood still, or were told\r\nheavily by the distinct beating of her heart. The east wind bore to her\r\near the sound of the quarters of hours, as they chimed from various\r\nchurches. At length eleven, half-past eleven was passed, and the hand of\r\nher watch began to climb slowly upwards toward the zenith, which she\r\ndesired so ardently that it should reach. She gazed on the dial-plate,\r\ntill she fancied that the pointers did not move; she placed her hands\r\nbefore her eyes resolutely, and would not look for a long long time;\r\nthree minutes had not been travelled over when again she viewed it; she\r\ntried to count her pulse, as a measurement of time; her trembling\r\nfingers refused to press the fluttering artery. At length another\r\nquarter of an hour elapsed, and then the succeeding one hurried on more\r\nspeedily. Clock after clock struck; they mingled their various tones, as\r\nthe hour of twelve was tolled throughout London. It seemed as if they\r\nwould never end. Silence came at last--a brief silence succeeded by a\r\nfirm quick step in the street below, and a knock at the door. \"Is he not\r\ntoo soon?\" poor fearful Ethel asked herself. But no; and in a moment\r\nafter, he was with her, safe in her glad embrace.\r\n\r\nPerhaps of the two, Villiers showed himself the most enraptured at this\r\nmeeting. He gazed on his sweet wife, followed every motion, and hung\r\nupon her voice, with all the delight of an exile, restored to his\r\nlong-lost home. \"What a transporting change,\" he said, \"to find myself\r\nwith you--to see you in the same room with me--to know again that,\r\nlovely and dear as you are, that you are mine--that I am again\r\nmyself--not the miserable dog that has been wandering about all day--a\r\nbody without a soul! For a few short hours, at least, Ethel will call me\r\nhers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, indeed, love,\" she replied, \"we will not be separated again.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will not even think about that tonight,\" said Villiers. \"The future\r\nis dark and blank, the present as radiant as your own sweet self can\r\nmake it.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day--and the following day did come, in spite of\r\nEthel's wishes, which would have held back the progress of time: it came\r\nand passed away; hour after hour stealing along, till it dwindled to a\r\nmere point. On the following day, they consulted earnestly on what was\r\nto be done. Villiers was greatly averse to Ethel's leaving her present\r\nabode, where every one was so very kind and attentive to her, and he was\r\nsanguine in his hopes of obtaining in the course of the week, just\r\ncommenced, a sum, sufficient to carry them to Paris or Brussels, were\r\nthey could remain till his affairs were finally arranged, and the\r\npayment of his debts regulated in a way to satisfy his creditors. One\r\nweek of absence; Villiers used all his persuasion to induce Ethel to\r\nsubmit to it. \"Where you can be, I can be also,\" was her answer; and she\r\nlistened unconvinced to the detail of the inconveniences which Villiers\r\npointed out: at last he almost got angry. \"I could call you unkind,\r\nEthel,\" he said, \"not to yield to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will yield to you,\" said Ethel, \"but you are wrong to ask me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that,\" replied her husband, \"do concede this point, dearest;\r\nif not because it is best that you should, then because I wish it, and\r\nask it of you. You say that your first desire is to make me happy, and\r\nyou pain me exceedingly by your--I had almost said perverseness.\"\r\n\r\nThus, not convinced, but obedient, Ethel agreed to allow him to depart\r\nalone. She bargained that she should be permitted to come each day in a\r\nhackney coach to a place where he might meet her, and they could spend\r\nan hour or two together. Edward did not like this plan at all, but there\r\nwas no remedy. \"You are at least resolved,\" he said, \"to spur my\r\nendeavours; I will not rest day or night, till I am enabled to get away\r\nfrom this vast dungeon.\"\r\n\r\nThe hours stole on. Even Edward's buoyant spirits could not bear up\r\nagainst the sadness of watching the fleeting moments till the one should\r\ncome, which must separate him from his wife. \"This nice, dear room,\" he\r\nsaid, \"I am sure I beg its pardon for having despised it so much\r\nformerly--it is not as lofty as a church, nor as grand as a palace, but\r\nit is very snug; and now you are in it, I discern even elegance in its\r\nexceedingly queer tables and chairs. When our carriage broke down on the\r\nApennines, how glad we should have been if a room like this had risen,\r\n'like an exhalation' for our shelter! Do you remember the barn of a\r\nplace we got into there, and our droll bed of the leaves of Indian corn,\r\nwhich crackled all night long, and awoke us twenty times with the fear\r\nof robbers? Then, indeed, twelve o'clock was not to separate us!\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this he sighed; the hour of eleven was indicated by Ethel's\r\nwatch, and still he lingered; but she grew frightened for him, and\r\nforced him to go away, while he besought the delay of but a few minutes.\r\n\r\nEthel exerted herself to endure as well as she could the separation of\r\nthe ensuing week. She was not of a repining disposition, yet she found\r\nit very hard to bear. The discomfort to which Villiers was exposed\r\nannoyed her, and the idea that she was not permitted to alleviate it\r\nadded to her painful feelings. In her prospect of life every evil was\r\nneutralized when shared--now they were doubled, because the pain of\r\nabsence from each other was superadded. She did not yield to her\r\nhusband, in her opinion that this was wrong. She was willing to go\r\nanywhere with him, and where he was, she also could be. There could be\r\nno degradation in a wife waiting on the fallen fortunes of her husband.\r\nNo debasement can arise from any services dictated by love. It is\r\ndespicable to submit to hardship for unworthy and worldly objects, but\r\nevery thing that is suffered for the sake of affection, is hallowed by\r\nthe disinterested sentiment, and affords triumph and delight to the\r\nwilling victim. Sometimes she tried in speech or on paper to express\r\nthese feelings, and so by the force of irresistible reasoning to\r\npersuade Edward to permit her to join him; but all argument was weak;\r\nthere was something beyond, that no words could express, which was\r\nstronger than any reason in her heart. Who can express the power of\r\nfaithful and single-hearted love? As well attempt to define the laws of\r\nlife, which occasions a continuity of feeling from the brain to the\r\nextremity of the frame, as try to explain how love can so unite two\r\nsouls, as to make each feel maimed and half alive, while divided. A\r\npowerful impulse was perpetually urging Ethel to go--to place herself\r\nnear Villiers--to refuse to depart. It was with the most violent\r\nstruggles that she overcame the instigation.\r\n\r\nShe never could forget herself while away from him, or find the\r\nslightest alleviation to her disquietude, except while conversing with\r\nFanny Derham, or rather while drawing her out, and listening to her, and\r\nwondering at a mechanism of mind so different from her own. Each had\r\nbeen the favourite daughter of men of superior qualities of mind. They\r\nhad been educated by their several fathers with the most sedulous care,\r\nand nothing could be more opposite than the result, except that, indeed,\r\nboth made duty the master motive of their actions. Ethel had received,\r\nso to speak, a sexual education. Lord Lodore had formed his ideal of what a\r\nwoman ought to be, of what he had wished to find his wife, and sought to\r\nmould his daughter accordingly. Mr. Derham contemplated the duties and\r\nobjects befitting an immortal soul, and had educated his child for the\r\nperformance of them. The one fashioned his offspring to be the wife of a\r\nfrail human being, and instructed her to be yielding, and to make it her\r\nduty to devote herself to his happiness, and to obey his will. The other\r\nsought to guard his from all weakness, to make her complete in herself,\r\nand to render her independent and self-sufficing. Born to poverty as\r\nFanny was, it was thus only that she could find happiness in rising\r\nabove her sphere; and, besides, a sense of pride, surviving his sense of\r\ninjury, caused him to wish that his child should set her heart on higher\r\nthings, than the distinctions and advantages of riches or rank; so that\r\nif ever brought into collision with his own family, she could look down\r\nwith calm superiority on the \"low ambition\" of the wealthy. While Ethel\r\nmade it her happiness and duty to give herself away with unreserved\r\nprodigality to him, whom she thought had every claim to her entire\r\ndevotion; Fanny zealously guarded her individuality, and would have\r\nscorned herself could she have been brought to place the treasures of\r\nher soul at the disposal of any power, except those moral laws which it\r\nwas her earnest endeavour never to transgress. Religion, reason, and\r\njustice--these were the landmarks of her life. She was kind-hearted,\r\ngenerous, and true--so also was Ethel; but the one was guided by the\r\ntenderness of her heart, while the other consulted her understanding,\r\nand would have died rather than have acted contrary to its dictates.\r\n\r\nTo guard Ethel from every contamination, Lord Lodore had secluded her from\r\nall society, and forestalled every circumstance that might bring her into\r\nconjunction with her fellow-creatures. He was equally careful to prevent\r\nher fostering any pride, except that of sex; and never spoke to her as\r\nif she were of an elevated rank: and the communication, however small,\r\nwhich she necessarily had with the Americans, made such ideas foreign to\r\nher mind. But she was excedingly shy; tremblingly alive to the slightest\r\nrepulse; and never perfectly fearless, (morally so, that is), except\r\nwhen under the shelter of another's care. Fanny's first principle was,\r\nthat what she ought to do, that she could do, without hesitation or\r\nregard for obstacles. She had something Quixotic in her nature; or\r\nrather she would have had, if a clear head and some experience, even\r\nyoung as she was, had not stood in the way of her making any glaring\r\nmistakes; so that her enterprises were never ridiculous; and being\r\nusually successful, could not be called extravagant. For herself, she\r\nneeded but her liberty and her books;--for others, she had her time, her\r\nthoughts, her decided and resolute modes of action, all at their\r\ncommand, whenever she was convinced that they had a just claim upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt was singular that the resolute and unshrinking Fanny should be the\r\ndaughter of Francis Derham; and the timid, retiring Ethel, of his bold\r\nand daring protector. But this is no uncommon case. We feel the evil\r\nresults of our own faults, and endeavour to guard our children from\r\nthem; forgetful that the opposite extreme has also its peculiar dangers.\r\nLord Lodore attributed his early misfortunes to the too great freedom he\r\nhad enjoyed, or rather to the unlimited scope given to his will, from his\r\nbirth. Mr. Derham saw the unhappiness that had sprung from his own\r\nyielding and undecided disposition. The one brought up his child to\r\ndependence; the other taught his to disdain every support, except the\r\napplause of her own conscience. Lodore fostered all the sensibility, all\r\nthe softness, of Ethel's feminine and delicat nature; while Fanny's\r\nfather strove to harden and confirm a character, in itself singularly\r\nstedfast and upright.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the great contrast thus exhibited between Ethel and Fanny,\r\none quality created a good deal of similarity between them. There was in\r\nboth a total absence of every factitious sentiment. They acted from\r\ntheir own hearts--from their own sense of right, without the\r\nintervention of worldly considerations. A feeling of duty ruled all\r\ntheir actions; and, however excellent a person's dispositions may be, it\r\nyet requires considerable elevation of character never to deviate from\r\nthe strict line of honour and integrity.\r\n\r\nFanny's society a little relieved Ethel's solitude: yet that did not\r\nweigh on her; and had she not been the child of her father's earliest\r\nfriend, and the companion of past days, she would have been disinclined,\r\nat this period, to cultivate an intimacy with her. She needed no\r\ncompanion except the thought of Edward, which was never absent from her\r\nmind. But amidst all her affection for her husband, which gained\r\nstrength, and, as it were, covered each day a larger portion of her\r\nbeing, any one associated with the name of Lodore--of her beloved father,\r\nhad a magic power to call forth her warmest feelings of interest. Both\r\nladies repeated to each other what they had heard from their several\r\nparents. Mr. Derham had, among his many lessons of usefulness, descanted\r\non the generosity and boldness of Fitzhenry, as offering an example to\r\nbe followed. And during the last months of Lodore's life, he had\r\nrecurred, with passionate fondness, to the memory of his early years,\r\nand painted in glowing colours the delicacy of feeling, the deep sense\r\nof gratitude, and the latent but fervid enthusiasm, which adorned the\r\ncharacter of Francis Derham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nIt does much trouble me to live without you:\r\nOur loves and loving souls have been so used\r\nTo one household in us.\r\n\r\nBEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe week passed on. It was the month of January, and very cold. A black\r\nfrost bound up every thing with ice, and the piercing air congealed the\r\nvery blood. Each day Ethel went to see her husband;--each day she had to\r\nencounter Mrs. Derham's intreaties not to go, and the reproaches of\r\nVilliers for coming. Both were unavailing to prevent the daily\r\npilgrimage. Mrs. Derham sighed heavily when she saw her enter the\r\nricketty hackney-coach, whose damp lining, gaping windows, and miserable\r\nstraw, made it a _cold-bed_ for catarrh--a very temple for the spirit of\r\nwinter. Villiers each day besought her to have horses put to their\r\nchariot, if she must come; but Ethel remembered all he had ever said of\r\nexpense, and his prognostications of how ill she would be able to endure\r\nthe petty, yet galling annoyances of poverty; and she resolved to prove,\r\nthat she could cheerfully bear every thing except separation from him.\r\nWith this laudable motive to incite her, she tasked her strength too\r\nfar. She kept up her spirits to meet him with a cheerful countenance;\r\nand she contrived to conceal the sufferings she endured while they were\r\ntogether. They got out and walked now and then; and this tended to keep\r\nup the vital warmth. Their course was generally taken over Blackfriars\r\nBridge; and it was on their return across the river, on whose surface\r\nlarge masses of ice floated, while a bitter north-east wind swept up,\r\nbearing on its blasts the unthawed breath of the German Ocean, that she\r\nfelt the cold enter her heart, and make her head feel dizzy. Still she\r\ncould smile, and ask Villiers why he objected to her taking an exercise\r\neven necessary for her health; and repeat again and again, that, bred in\r\nAmerica, an English winter was but a faint reflex of what she had\r\nencountered there, and insist upon being permitted to come on the\r\nfollowing day. These were precious moments in her eyes, worth all the\r\npain they occasioned,--well worth the struggle she made for the\r\nrepetition. Edward's endearing attentions--the knowledge she had that\r\nshe was loved--the swelling and earnest affection that warmed her own\r\nheart,--hallowed these hard-earned minutes, and gave her the sweet\r\npleasure of knowing that she demonstrated, in some slight degree, the\r\nprofound and all engrossing attachment which pervaded her entire being.\r\nThey parted; and often she arrived nearly senseless at Duke Street, and\r\nonce or twice fainted on entering the warm room: but it was not pain she\r\nfelt then--the emotions of the soul conquered the sensation of her body,\r\nand pleasure, the intense pleasure of affection, was predominant through\r\nall.\r\n\r\nSunday came again, and brought Villiers to her home. Mrs. Derham took\r\nthe opportunity to represent to him the injury that Ethel was doing\r\nherself; and begged him, as he cared for her health, to forbid her\r\nexposing herself to the inclement weather.\r\n\r\n\"You hear this, Ethel,\" said Villiers; \"and yet you are obstinate. It\r\nthis right? What can I urge, what can I do, to prevent this wrong-headed\r\npertinacity?\"\r\n\r\n\"You use such very hard words,\" replied Ethel, smiling, \"that you\r\nfrighten me into believing myself criminal. But so far am I from\r\nconceding, that you only give me courage to say, that I cannot any\r\nlonger endure the sad and separate life we lead. It must be changed,\r\ndearest; we must be together.\"\r\n\r\nVilliers was pacing the room impatiently: with an exclamation almost\r\napproaching to anger, he stopped before his wife, to remonstrate and to\r\nreproach. But as he gazed upon her upturned face, fixed so beseechingly\r\nand fondly on him, he fancied that he saw the hues of ill-health\r\nstealing across her cheeks, and thinness displacing the roundness of her\r\nform. A strange emotion flashed across him; a new fear, too terrible\r\neven to be acknowledged to himself, which passed, like the shadow of a\r\nstorm, across his anticipations, and filled him with inquietude. His\r\nreprehension was changed to a caress, as he said, \"You are right, my\r\nlove, quite right; we must not live thus. You are unable to take care of\r\nyourself; and I am very wrong to give up my dearest privilege, of\r\nwatching day and night over the welfare of my only treasure. We will be\r\ntogether, Ethel; if the worst come, it cannot be very bad, while we are\r\ntrue to each other.\"\r\n\r\nTears filled the poor girl's eyes--tears of joy and tenderness--at\r\nhearing Edward echo the sentiments she cherished as the most sacred in\r\nthe world. For a few minutes, they forgot every thing in the\r\naffectionate kiss, which ratified, as it were, this new law; and then\r\nEdward considered how best he could carry it into effect.\r\n\r\n\"Gayland,\" he said, (he was his solicitor,) \"has appointed to see me on\r\nThursday morning, and has good hopes of definitively arranging the\r\nconditions for the loan of the five hundred pounds, which is to enable\r\nus to wait for better things. On Thursday evening, we will leave town.\r\nWe will go to some pretty country inn, to wait till I have signed these\r\npapers; and trust to Providence that no ill will arise. We must not be\r\nmore than fifteen or twenty miles from London; so that when I am obliged\r\nto go up, I can return again in a few hours. Tell me, sweet, does this\r\nscheme please you?\"\r\n\r\nEthel expressed her warmest gratitude; and then Villiers insinuated his\r\ncondition, that she should not come to see him in the interval, but\r\nremain, taking care of herself, till, on Thursday afternoon, at six\r\no'clock, she came, with their chariot, to the northern side of St.\r\nPaul's Churchyard, where he would immediately join her. They might\r\nwrite, meanwhile: he promised letters as long as if they were to go to\r\nIndia; and soothed her annoyance with every expression of thankfulness\r\nat her giving up this point. She did give it up, with all the readiness\r\nshe could muster; and this increased, as he dwelt upon the enjoyment\r\nthey would share, in exchanging foggy, smoky London, for the\r\never-pleasing aspect of nature, which, even during frost and snow,\r\npossesses her own charms--her own wonders; and can gratify our senses by\r\na thousand forms of beauty, which have no existence in a dingy\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\nWhen the evening hour came for the young pair to separate, their hearts\r\nwere cheered by the near prospect of re-union; and a belief that the, to\r\nthem, trivial privations of poverty were the only ones they would have\r\nto endure. The thrill of fear which had crossed the mind of Villiers, as\r\nto the health and preservation of his wife, had served to dissipate the\r\nlingering sense of shame and degradation inspired by the penury of their\r\nsituation. He felt that there was something better than wealth, and the\r\nattendance of his fellow-creatures; something worse than poverty, and\r\nthe world's scorn. Within the fragile form of Ethel, there beat a heart\r\nof more worth than a king's ransom; and its pulsations were ruled by\r\nhim. To lose her! What would all that earth can afford, of power or\r\nsplendour, appear without her? He pressed her to his bosom, and knew\r\nthat his arms encircled all life's worth for him. Never again could he\r\nforget the deep-felt appreciation of her value, which then took root in\r\nhis mind; while she, become conscious, by force of sympathy, of the kind\r\nof revolution that was made in his sentiments, felt that the foundations\r\nof her life grew strong, and that her hopes in this world became\r\nstedfast and enduring. Before, a wall of separation, however slight, had\r\ndivided them; they had followed a system of conduct independent of each\r\nother, and passed their censure upon the ideas of either. This was over\r\nnow--they were one--one sense of right--one feeling of happiness; and\r\nwhen they parted that night, each felt that they truly possessed the\r\nother; and that by mingling every hope and wish, they had confirmed the\r\nmarriage of their hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . . . . Think but whither\r\nNow you can go; what you can do to live;\r\nHow near you have barred all ports to your own\r\nsuccour.\r\nExcept this one that here I open, love.\r\n\r\nBEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most pleasing thoughts shed their balmy influence on Ethel's repose\r\nthat night. Edward's scheme of a country inn, where the very freedom\r\nwould make them more entirely dependent upon each other, was absolutely\r\nenchanting. Where we establish ourselves, and look forward to the\r\npassage of a long interval of time, we form ties with, and assume duties\r\ntowards, many of our fellow-creatures, each of which must diminish the\r\nsingleness of the soul's devotion towards the selected one. No doubt\r\nthis is the fitting position for human beings to place themselves in, as\r\naffording a greater scope for utility: but for a brief space, to have no\r\noccupation but that of contributing to the happiness of him to whom her\r\nlife was consecrated, appeared to Ethel a very heaven upon earth. It was\r\nnot that she was narrow-hearted: so much affection demands a spacious\r\nmansion for its abode; but in their present position of struggle and\r\ndifficulty, there was no possibility of extending her sphere of\r\nbenevolence, and she gladly concentrated her endeavours in the one\r\nobject whose happiness was in her hands.\r\n\r\nAll night, even in sleep, a peculiar sense of calm enjoyment soothed the\r\nmind of Ethel, and she awoke in the morning with buoyant spirits, and a\r\nsoul all alive to its own pleasurable existence. She sat at her little\r\nsolitary breakfast table, musing with still renewed delight upon the\r\nprospect opened before her, when suddenly she was startled by the vision\r\nof an empty purse. What could Villiers intend? She felt assured that his\r\nstock was very nearly exhausted, and for herself two sovereigns, which\r\nwere not sufficient to meet the demands of the last week, was all that\r\nshe possessed. She tried to recollect if Edward had said any thing that\r\ndenoted any expectation of receiving money; on the contrary--diving into\r\nthe recesses of her memory, she called to mind that he had said, \"We\r\nshall receive your poor little dividend of a hundred pounds, in less\r\nthan a fortnight, so we shall be able to live, even if Gayland should\r\ndelay getting the other money--I suppose we have enough to get on till\r\nthen.\"\r\n\r\nHe had said this inquiringly, and she knew that she had made a sign of\r\nassent, though at the time, she had no thought of the real purport of\r\nhis question or of her answer. What was to be done? The obvious\r\nconsequence of her reflections was at once to destroy the cherished\r\nscheme of going out of town with Villiers. This was a misfortune too\r\ngreat to bear, and she at last decided upon having again recourse to her\r\naunt. Unused to every money transaction, she had not that terror of\r\nobligation, nor dislike of asking, which is so necessary to preserve our\r\nindependence, and even our sense of justice, through life. Money had\r\nalways been placed like counters in her hand; she had never known whence\r\nit came, and until her marriage, she had never disposed of more than\r\nvery small sums. Subsequently Villiers had been the director of their\r\nexpenses. This was the faulty part of her father's system of education.\r\nBut Lodore's domestic habits were for a great part founded on experience in\r\nforeign countries, and he forgot that an English wife is usually the\r\ncashier--the sole controller of the disbursements of her family. It\r\nseemed as easy a thing for Ethel to ask for money from Mrs. Fitzhenry,\r\nas she knew it would be easy for her to give. In compliance, however,\r\nwith Villiers's notions, she limited her request to ten pounds, and tried\r\nto word her letter so as to create no suspicion in her aunt's mind with\r\nregard to their resources. This task achieved, she dismissed every\r\nannoying thought, and when Fanny came to express her hope, that, bleak\r\nand snowy as was the day, she did not intend to make her accustomed\r\npilgrimage, with a countenance beaming with delight, she dilated on\r\ntheir plan, and spoke as if on the much-desired Thursday, the gates of\r\nElysium were to be thrown open for her.\r\n\r\nThere would have appeared something childish in her gladness to the\r\nabstracted and philosophic mind of Fanny, but that the real evils of her\r\nsituation, and the fortitude, touching in its unconscious simplicity,\r\nwith which she encountered them, commanded respect. Ethel, as well as\r\nher friend, was elevated above the common place of life; she also\r\nfostered a state of mind, \"lofty and magnificent, fitted rather to\r\ncommand than to obey, not only suffering patiently, but even making\r\nlight of all human cares; a grand and dignified self-possession, which\r\nfears nothing, yields to no one, and remains for ever unvanquished.\"\r\nWhen Fanny, in one of their conversations, while describing the uses of\r\nphilosophy, had translated this eulogium of its effects from Cicero,\r\nEthel had exclaimed, \"This is love--it is love alone that divides us\r\nfrom sordid earthborn thoughts, and causes us to walk alone, girt by its\r\nown beauty and power.\"\r\n\r\nFanny smiled; yet while she saw slavery rather than a proud independence\r\nin the creed of Ethel, she admired the warmth of heart which could endow\r\nwith so much brilliancy a state of privation and solitude. At the\r\npresent moment, when Mrs. Villiers was rapturously announcing their\r\nscheme for leaving London, an expression of pain mantled over Fanny's\r\nfeatures; her clear blue eyes became suffused, a large tear gathered on\r\nher lashes. \"What is the matter?\" asked Ethel anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"That I am a fool--but pardon me, for the folly is already passed away.\r\nFor the first time you have made it hard for me to keep my soul firm in\r\nits own single existence. I have been debarred from all intercourse with\r\nthose whose ideas rise above the soil on which they tread, except in my\r\ndear books, and I thought I should never be attached to any thing but\r\nthem. Yet do not think me selfish, Mr. Villiers is quite right--it is\r\nmuch better that you should not be apart--I am delighted with his plan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Away or near, dear Fanny,\" said Ethel, in a caressing tone, \"I never\r\ncan forget your kindness--never cease to feel the warmest friendship for\r\nyou. Remember, our fathers were friends, and their children ought to\r\ninherit the same faithful attachment.\"\r\n\r\nFanny smiled faintly. \"You must not seduce me from my resolves,\" she\r\nsaid. \"I know my fate in this world, and I am determined to be true to\r\nmyself to the end. Yet I am not ungrateful to you, even while I declare,\r\nthat I shall do my best to forget this brief interval, during which, I\r\nhave no longer, like Demogorgon, lived alone in my own world, but become\r\naware that there are ties of sympathy between me and my\r\nfellow-creatures, in whose existence I did not believe before.\"\r\n\r\nFanny's language, drawn from her books, not because she tried to\r\nimitate, but because conversing perpetually with them, it was natural\r\nthat she should adopt their style, was always energetic and imaginative;\r\nbut her quiet manner destroyed every idea of exaggeration of sentiment:\r\nit was necessary to hear her soft and low, but very distinct voice utter\r\nher lofty sentiments, to be conscious that the calm of deep waters was\r\nthe element in which she dwelt--not the fretful breakers that spend\r\nthemselves in sound.\r\n\r\nThe day seemed rather long to Ethel, who counted the hours until\r\nThursday. Gladly she laid her head on the pillow at night, and bade\r\nadieu to the foregone hours. The first thing that awoke her in the\r\nmorning, was the postman's knock; it brought, as she had been promised,\r\na long, long letter from Edward. He had never before written with so\r\nmuch affection or with such an overflowing of tenderness, that made her\r\nthe centre of his world--the calm fair lake to receive into its bosom\r\nthe streams of thought and feeling which flowed from him, and yet which,\r\nafter all, had their primal source in her. \"I am a very happy girl,\"\r\nthought Ethel, as she kissed the beloved papers, and gazed on them in\r\necstasy; \"more happy than I thought it was ever given us to be in this\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nShe rose and began to dress; she delayed reading more than a line or\r\ntwo, that she might enjoy her dearest pleasure for a longer time--then\r\nagain, unable to controul her impatience, she sat half dressed, and\r\nfinished all--and was begining anew, when there was a tap at her door.\r\nIt was Fanny. She looked disturbed and anxious, and Ethel's fears were\r\nin a moment awake.\r\n\r\n\"Something annoying has occurred,\" she said; \"yet I do not think that\r\nthere is any thing to dread, though there is a danger to prevent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak quickly,\" cried Ethel, \"do not keep me in suspense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be calm--it is nothing sudden, it is only a repetition of the old\r\nstory. A boy has just been here--a boy you gave a sovereign to--do you\r\nremember?--the night of your arrival. It seems that he has vowed himself\r\nto your service ever since. Those two odious men, who were here once,\r\nare often at his master's place-an alehouse, you know. Well, yesterday\r\nnight, he overheard them saying, that Mr. Villiers's resort at the London\r\ncoffee-house, was discovered, or at least suspected, and that a writ was\r\nto be taken out against him in the city.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that mean?\" cried Ethel.\r\n\r\n\"That Mr. Villiers will probably be arrested to-day, or to-morrow, if he\r\nremains where he is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go directly to him,\" cried Ethel; \"we must leave town at once.\r\nGod grant that I am not too late!\"\r\n\r\nSeeing her extreme agitation, Fanny remained with her--forced her to\r\ntake some breakfast, and then, fearing that if any thing had really\r\ntaken place, she would be quite bewildered, asked her permission to\r\naccompany her. \"Will you indeed come with me?\" Ethel exclaimed, \"How\r\ndear, how good you are! O yes, do come--I can never go through it all\r\nalone; I shall die, if I do not find him.\"\r\n\r\nA hackney coach had been called, and they hastened with what speed they\r\nmight, to their destination. A kind of panic seized upon Ethel, a tremor\r\nshook her limbs, so that when they at last stopped, she was unable to\r\nspeak. Fanny was about to ask for Mr. Villiers, when an exclamation of\r\njoy from Ethel stopped her; Edward had seen them, and was at the coach\r\ndoor. The snow lay thick around on the roofs of the houses, and on every\r\natom of vantage ground it could obtain; it was then snowing, and as the\r\nchilly fleece dropped through or was driven about in the dark\r\natmosphere, it spread a most disconsolate appearance over every thing;\r\nand nothing could look more dreary than poor Ethel's jumbling vehicle,\r\nwith its drooping animals, and the half-frozen driver. Villiers had made\r\nup his mind that he should never be mortified by seeing her again in\r\nthis sort of equipage, and he hurried down, the words of reproach\r\nalready on his lips, \"Is this your promise?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dearest, it is. Come in, there is danger here.--Come in--we must\r\ngo directly.\"\r\n\r\nSeeing Fanny, Villiers became aware that there was some absolute cause\r\nfor their journey, so he obeyed and quickly heard the danger that\r\nthreatened him. \"It would have been better,\" he said, \"that you had come\r\nin the carriage, and that we had instantly left town.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" cried Ethel; \"till to-morrow--that is quite impossible. We\r\nhave no money until to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my love, since it is so, we must arrange as well as we can. Do\r\nyou return home immediately--this cold will kill you. I will take care\r\nof myself, and you can come for me on Thursday evening, as we proposed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not ask it of me, Edward,\" said Ethel; \"I cannot leave you. I could\r\nnever live through these two days away from you--you must not desire\r\nit--you will kill me.\"\r\n\r\nEdward kissed her pale cheek. \"You tremble,\" he said; \"how violently you\r\ntremble! Good God! what can we do? What would you have me do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Any thing, so that we remain together. It is of so little consequence\r\nwhere we pass the next twenty-four hours, so that we are together. There\r\nare many hotels in town.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must not venture to any of these; and then to take you in this\r\nmiserable manner, without servants, or any thing to command attendance.\r\nBut you shall have your own way; having deprived you of every other\r\nluxury, at least, you shall have your will; which, you know, compensates\r\nfor every thing with your obstinate sex.\"\r\n\r\nEthel smiled, rejoicing to find him in so good and accommodating a\r\nhumour. \"Yes, pretty one,\" he continued, marking her feelings, \"you\r\nshall be as wretched and uncomfortable as your heart can desire. We will\r\nplay the incognito in such a style, that if our adventures were printed,\r\nthey would compete with those of Don Quixote and the fair Dulcinea. But\r\nMiss Derham must not be admitted into our vagabondizing--we will not\r\ndetain her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet she must know whither we are going, to bring us the letters that\r\nwill confer freedom on us.\"\r\n\r\nVilliers wrote hastily an address on a card. \"You will find us there,\"\r\nhe said. \"Do not mention names when you come. We shall remain, I\r\nsuppose, till Thursday.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we shall see you some time to-morrow, dear Fanny?\" asked Ethel.\r\nAlready she looked bright and happy; she esteemed herself fortunate to\r\nhave gained so easily a point she had feared she must struggle for--or\r\nperhaps give up altogether. Fanny left them, and the coachman having\r\nreceived his directions, drove slowly on through the deep snow, which\r\nfell thickly on the road; while they, nestling close to each other, were\r\nso engrossed by the gladness of re-union, that had Cinderella's\r\ngodmother transmuted their crazy vehicle for a golden coach, redolent of\r\nthe perfumes of fairy land, they had scarcely been aware of the change.\r\nTheir own hearts formed a more real fairy land, which accompanied them\r\nwhithersoever they went, and could as easily spread its enchantments\r\nover the shattered machine in which they now jumbled along, as amidst\r\nthe cloth of gold and marbles of an eastern palace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nFew people know how little is necessary to live.\r\nWhat is called or thought _hardship_ is nothing; _one_\r\nunhappy feeling is worse than a thousand years of it.\r\n\r\nLORD EDWARD FITZGERALD.\r\n\r\n\r\nUncertain what to do, Villiers had hastily determined that they should\r\ntake up their abode at a little inn near Brixton, to wait till Thursday.\r\nHe did not know the place except by having passed it, and observed a\r\nsmart landlady at the door; so he trusted that it would be neat and\r\nclean. There was nothing imposing in the apperance of the young pair and\r\ntheir hackney coach, accordingly there was no bustling civility\r\ndisplayed to receive them. However, when the fire was once lighted, the\r\nold-fashioned sofa drawn near, and dinner ordered, they sat together and\r\nfelt very happy; outcasts though they were, wanderers from civilized\r\nexistence, shut out, through poverty, from the refinements and gilt\r\nelegancies of life.\r\n\r\nOne only cloud there was, when Villiers asked his wife an explanation\r\nabout their resources, and inquired whence she expected to receive money\r\non the following day. Ethel explained. Villiers looked disturbed. There\r\nwas something almost of anger in his voice, when he said, \"And so,\r\nEthel, you feel no compunction in acting in exact opposition to my\r\nwishes, my principles, my resolves?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, dear Edward, what can principles have to do with borrowing a few\r\npounds from dear good Aunt Bessy? Besides, we can repay her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be assured that we shall,\" replied Villiers; \"and you will never again,\r\nI trust, behave so unjustly by me. There are certain things in which we\r\nmust judged and act for ourselves, and the question of money\r\ntransactions is one. I may suffer--and you, alas! may also, through\r\npoverty; though you have taken pains to persuade me, that you do not\r\nfeel that struggles, which, for your sake chiefly, embitter my\r\nexistence. Yet they are nothing in comparison with the loss of my\r\nindependence--the sense of obligation--the knowledge that my kind\r\nfriends can talk over my affairs, take me to task, and call me a burthen\r\nto them. Why am I as I am? I have friends and connexions who would\r\nreadily assist me at this extremity, if I asked it, and I might turn\r\ntheir kind feelings into sterling gold if I would; but I have no desire\r\nto work this transmutation--I prefer their friendship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean,\" inquired his wife, \"that your friends would not love you\r\nthe better for having been of service to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"If they could serve me without annoyance to themselves they might; but\r\nhigh in rank and wealthy as many of my relations are, there is not one\r\namong them, at least of those to whom I could have recourse, who do not\r\ndispose of their resources to the uttermost shilling, in their own way.\r\nI then come to interfere with and to disarrange their plans; at first,\r\nthis might not be much--but presently they would weigh me against the\r\ngold I needed, and it might happen, that my scale would kick the beam.\r\n\r\n\"I speak for myself not for others; I may be too proud, too\r\nsensitive--but so I am. Ever since I knew what pecuniary obligations\r\nwere, I resolved to lay under such to no man, and this resolve was\r\nstronger than my love for you; judge therefore of its force, and the\r\nviolence you do me, when you would oblige me to act against it. Did I\r\nbegin to borrow, a train of thoughts would enter the lender's mind; the\r\nconsciousness of which, would haunt me like a crime. My actions would be\r\nscanned--I should be blamed for this, rebuked for that--even your name,\r\nmy Ethel, which I would place, like a star in the sky, far above their\r\nmathematical measurements, would become stale in their mouths, and the\r\npropriety of our marriage canvassed: could you bear that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I yield to all you say,\" she answered; \"yet this is strange morality.\r\nAre generosity, benevolence, and gratitude, to be exploded among us? Is\r\njustice, which orders that the rich give of his superfluity to the poor,\r\nto be banished from the world?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are eloquent,\" said Villiers; \"but, my little wild American, this\r\nis philosophy for the back-woods only. We have got beyond the primeval\r\nsimplicity of barter and exchange among gentlemen; and it is such if I\r\ngive gratitude in return for fifty pounds: by-and-by my fellow-trader\r\nmay grumble at the bargain. All this will become very clear to you\r\nhereafter, I fear--when knowledge of the world teaches you what sordid\r\nknaves we all are; it is to prevent your learning this lesson in a\r\npainful way, that I guard you so jealously from making a wrong step at\r\nthis crisis.\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak of dreams,\" said Ethel, \"as if dear aunt Bessy would feel any\r\nthing but pleasure in sending her mite to her own dear niece.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have told you what I wish,\" replied her husband, \"my honour is in\r\nyour hands; and I implore you, on this point, to preserve it in the way\r\nI desire. There is but one relationship that authorizes any thing like\r\ncommunity of goods, it is that of parent and child; but we are orphans,\r\ndearest--step-children, who are not permitted to foster our filial\r\nsentiments. My father is unworthy of his name--the animal who destroys\r\nits offspring at its birth is merciful in comparison with him: had he\r\ncast me off at once, I should have hardened my hands with labour, and\r\nearned my daily bread; but I was trained to \"high-born necessities,\" and\r\nhave all the \"wide wants and narrow powers\"[1] of the heir of wealth. But\r\nlet us dismiss this ungrateful subject. I never willingly advert, even\r\nin my own mind, to my father's unpaternal conduct. Let us instead fancy,\r\nsweet love, that we were born to what we have--that we are cottagers,\r\nthe children of mechanics, or wanderers in a barbarous country, where\r\nmoney is not; and imagine that this repose, this cheerful fire, this\r\nshelter from the pelting snow without, is an unexpected blessing. Strip\r\na man bare to what nature made him, and place him here, and what a hoard\r\nof luxury and wealth would not this room contain! In the Illinois, love,\r\nfew mansions could compete with this.\"\r\n\r\nThis was speaking in a language which Ethel could easily comprehend; she\r\nhad several times wished to express this very idea, but she feared to\r\nhurt the refined and exclusive feelings of her husband. A splendid\r\ndwelling, costly living, and many attendants, were with her the\r\nadjuncts, not the material, of life. If the stage on which she played\r\nher part was to be so decorated, it was well; if otherwise, the change\r\ndid not merit her attention. Love scoffed at such idle trappings, and\r\ncould build his tent of canvas, and sleep close nestled in her heart as\r\nsoftly, being only the more lovely and the more true, from the absence\r\nof every meretricious ornament.\r\n\r\nThis was another of Ethel's happy evenings, when she felt drawn close to\r\nhim she loved, and found elysium in the intimate union of their\r\nthoughts. The dusky room showed them but half to each other; and the\r\nlooks of each, beaming with tenderness, drank life from one another's\r\ngaze. The soft shadows thrown on their countenances, gave a lamp-like\r\nlustre to their eyes, in which the purest spirit of affection sat,\r\nweaving such unity of sentiment, such strong bonds of attachment, as\r\nmade all life dwindle to a point, and freighted the passing minute with\r\nthe hopes and fears of their entire existence. Not much was said, and\r\ntheir words were childish--words\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellette dar loro soli ambedui,\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich a listener would have judged to be meaningless. But the mystery of\r\nlove gave a deep sense to each syllable. The hours flew lightly away. There\r\nwas nothing to interrupt, nothing to disturb. Night came and the day was\r\nat an end; but Ethel looked forward to the next, with faith in its equal\r\nfelicity, and did not regret the fleet passage of time.\r\n\r\nThey had been asked during the evening if they were going by any early\r\ncoach on the following morning, and a simple negative was given. On that\r\nmorning they sat at their breakfast, with some diminution of the\r\nsanguine hopes of the previous evening. For morning is the time for\r\naction, of looking forward, of expectation,--and they must spend this in\r\nwaiting, cooped up in a little room, overlooking no cheering scene. A\r\nhigh road, thickly covered with snow, on which various vehicles were\r\nperpetually passing, was immediately before them. Opposite was a row of\r\nmean-looking houses, between which might be distinguished low fields\r\nburied in snow; and the dreary dark-looking sky bending over all, added\r\nto the forlorn aspect of nature. Villiers was very impatient to get\r\naway, yet another day must be passed here, and there was no help.\r\n\r\nOn the breakfast-table the waiter had placed the bill of the previous\r\nday; it remained unnoticed, and he left it on the table when the things\r\nwere taken away. \"I wonder when Fanny will come,\" said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not at all to-day,\" observed Villiers, \"she knows that we\r\nintend to remain till tomorrow here; and if your aunt's letter is\r\ndelayed till then, I see no chance of her coming, nor any use in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Aunt Bessy will not delay; her answer is certain of arriving this\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you imagine, love. You know little of the various chances that wait\r\nupon borrowing.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after, unable to bear confinement to the house, uneasy in his\r\nthoughts, and desirous a little to dissipate them by exercise, Villiers\r\nwent out. Ethel, taking a small Shakspeare, which her husband had had\r\nwith him at the coffee-house, occupied herself by reading, or turning\r\nfrom the written page to her own thoughts, gave herself up to reverie,\r\ndwelling on many an evanescent idea, and reverting delightedly to many\r\nscenes, which her memory recalled. She was one of those who \"know the\r\npleasures of solitude, when we hold commune alone with the tranquil\r\nsolemnity of nature.\" The thought of her father, of the Illinois, and\r\nthe measureless forest rose before her, and in her ear was the dashing\r\nof the stream which flowed near their abode. Her light feet again\r\ncrossed the prairie, and a thousand appearances of sky and earth\r\ndeparted for ever, were retraced in her brain. \"Would not Edward be\r\nhappy there?\" she thought: \"why should we not go? We should miss dear\r\nHoratio; but what else could we regret that we leave behind? and perhaps\r\nhe would join us, and then we should be quite happy.\" And then her fancy\r\npictured her new home and all its delights, till her eyes were suffused\r\nwith tender feeling, as her imagination sketched a variety of\r\nscenes--the pleasant labours of cultivation, the rides, the hunting, the\r\nboating, all common-place occurrences, which, attended on by love, were\r\nexalted into a perpetual gorgeous procession of beatified hours. And\r\nthen again she allowed to herself that Europe or America could contain\r\nthe same delights. She recollected Italy, and her feelings grew more\r\nsolemn and blissful as she meditated on the wondrous beauty and\r\nchangeful but deep interest of that land of memory.\r\n\r\nVilliers did not return for some hours;--he also had indulged in\r\nreverie--long-drawn, but not quite so pleasant as that of his\r\ninexperienced wife. The realities of life were kneaded up too entirely\r\nwith his prospects and schemes, for them to assume the fairy hues that\r\nadorned Ethel's. He could not see the end to his present struggle for\r\nthe narrowest independence. Very slender hopes had been held out to him;\r\nand thus he was to drag out an embittered existence, spent upon sordid\r\ncares, till his father died--an ungrateful idea, from which he turned\r\nwith a sigh. He walked speedily, on account of the cold; and as his\r\nblood began to circulate more cheerily in his frame, a change came over\r\nthe tenor of his thoughts. From the midst of the desolation in which he\r\nwas lost, a vision of happiness arose, that forced itself on his\r\nspeculations, in spite, as he imagined, of his better reason. The image\r\nof an elegant home, here or in Italy, adorned by Ethel--cheered by the\r\npresence of friends, unshadowed by any cares, presented itself to his\r\nmind with strange distinctness and pertinacity. At no time had Villiers\r\nloved so passionately as now. The difficulties of their situation had\r\nexalted her, who shared them with such cheerful fortitude, into an angel\r\nof consolation. The pride of man in possessing the affections of this\r\nlovely and noble-minded creature, was blended with the tenderest desire\r\nof protecting and serving her. His heart glowed with honest joy at the\r\nreflection that her happiness depended upon him solely, and that he was\r\nready to devote his life to secure it. Was there any action too arduous,\r\nany care too minute, to display his gratitude and his perfect affection?\r\nAs his recollection came back, he found that he was at a considerable\r\ndistance from her, so he swiftly turned his steps homeward, (that was\r\nhis home where she was,) and scarcely felt that he trod earth as he\r\nrecollected that each moment carried him nearer, and that he should soon\r\nmeet the fond gaze of the kindest, sweetest eyes in the world.\r\n\r\nThus they met, with a renewed joy, after a short absence, each reaping,\r\nfrom their separate meditations, a fresh harvest of loving thoughts and\r\ninterchange of grateful emotion. Great was the pity that such was their\r\nsituation--that circumstances, all mean and trivial, drew them from\r\ntheir heaven-high elevation, to the more sordid cares of this dirty\r\nplanet. Yet why name it pity? their pure natures could turn the\r\ngrovelling substance presented to them, to ambrosial food for the\r\nsustenance of love.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Cenci.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's a bliss beyond all that the minstrel has told,\r\nWhen two that are linked in one heavenly tie,\r\nWith heart never changing, and brow never cold,\r\nLove on through all ills, and love on till they die.\r\n\r\nLALLA ROOKH.\r\n\r\n\r\nVilliers had not been returned long, when the waiter came in, and\r\ninformed them, that his mistress declined serving their dinner, till her\r\nbill of the morning was paid; and then he left the room. The gentle pair\r\nlooked at each other, and laughed. \"We must wait till Fanny comes, I\r\nfear,\" said Ethel; \"for my purse is literally empty.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if Miss Derham should not come?\" remarked Villiers.\r\n\r\n\"But she will!--she has delayed, but I am perfectly certain that she\r\nwill come in the course of the day: I do not feel the least doubt about\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nTo quicken the passage of time, Ethel employed herself in netting a\r\npurse, (the inutility of which Villiers smilingly remarked,) while her\r\nhusband read to her some of the scenes from Shakspeare's play of\r\n\"Troilus and Cressida.\" The profound philosophy, and intense passion, of\r\nthis drama, adorned by the most magnificent poetry that can even be\r\nfound in the pages of this prince of poets, caused each to hang\r\nattentive and delighted upon their occupation. As it grew dark, Villiers\r\nstirred up the fire, and still went on; till having with difficulty\r\ndecyphered the lines--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"She was beloved--she loved;--she is, and doth;\r\nBut still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth,\"--\r\n\r\n\r\nhe closed the books. \"It is in vain,\" he said; \"our liberator does\r\nnot come; and these churls will not give us lights.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is early yet, dearest,\" replied Ethel;--\"not yet four o'clock. Would\r\nTroilus and Cressida have repined at having been left darkling a few\r\nminutes? How much happier we are than all the heroes and heroines that\r\never lived or were imagined! they grasped at the mere shadow of the\r\nthing, whose substance we absolutely possess. Let us know and\r\nacknowledge our good fortune. God knows, I do, and am beyond words\r\ngrateful!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is much to be grateful for--sharing the fortunes of a ruined man!\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not speak as Troilus does,\" replied Ethel smiling: \"he knew\r\nbetter the worth of love compared with worldly trifles.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would have me protest, then,\" said Villiers;--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But, alas!\r\nI am as true as truth's simplicity,\r\nAnd simpler than the infancy of truth;\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"so that all I can say is, that you are a very ill-used little girl, to be\r\nmated as you are--so buried, with all your loveliness, in this\r\nobscurity--so bound, though akin to heaven, to the basest dross of\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are poetical, dearest, and I thank you. For my own part, I am in\r\nlove with ill luck. I do not think we should have discovered how very\r\ndear we are to each other, had we sailed for ever on a summer sea.\"\r\n\r\nSuch talk, a little prolonged, at length dwindled to silence. Edward\r\ndrew her nearer to him; and as his arm encircled her waist, she placed\r\nher sweet head on his bosom, and they remained in silent reverie. He, as\r\nwith his other hand he played with her shining ringlets, and parted them\r\non her fair brow, was disturbed in thought, and saddened by a sense of\r\ndegradation. Not to be able to defend the angelic creature, who depended\r\non him, from the world's insults, galled his soul, and embittered even\r\nthe heart's union that existed between them. She did not think--she did\r\nknow of these things. After many minutes of silence, she said,--\"I have\r\nbeen trying to discover why it is absolute pleasure to suffer pain for\r\nthose we love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pleasure in pain!--you speak riddles.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" she replied, raising her head; \"but I have divined this. The\r\ngreat pleasure of love is derived from sympathy--the feeling of\r\nunion--of unity. Any thing that makes us alive to the sense of\r\nlove--that imprints deeper on our plastic consciousness the knowledge of\r\nthe existence of our affection, causes an increase of happiness. There\r\nare two things to which we are most sensitive--pleasure and pain. But\r\nhabit can somewhat dull the first; and that which was in its newness,\r\necstasy--our being joined for ever--becomes, like the air we breathe, a\r\nthing we could not live without, but yet in which we are rather\r\npassively than actively happy. But when pain comes to awaken us to a\r\ntrue sense of how much we love--when we suffer for one another's dear\r\nsake--the consciousness of attachment swells our hearts: we are recalled\r\nfrom the forgetfulness engendered by custom; and the awakening and\r\nrenewal of the sense of affection brings with it a joy, that sweetens to\r\nits dregs the bitterest cup.\"\r\n\r\n\"Encourage this philosophy, dear Ethel,\" replied Villiers; \"you will\r\nneed it: but it shames me to think that I am your teacher in this\r\nmournful truth.\" As he spoke, his whole frame was agitated by tenderness\r\nand grief. Ethel could see, by the dull fire-light, a tear gather on his\r\neye-lashes: it fell upon her hand. She threw her arms round him, and\r\npressed him to her heart with a passionate gush of weeping, occasioned\r\npartly by remorse at having so moved him, and partly by her heart's\r\noverflowing with the dear security of being loved.\r\n\r\nThey had but a little recovered from this scene, when the waiter,\r\nbringing in lights, announced Miss Derham. Her coming had been full of\r\ndisasters. After many threatenings, and much time consumed in clumsy\r\nrepairs, her hackney-coach had fairly broken down: she had walked the\r\nrest of the way; but they were much further from town than she expected;\r\nand thus she accounted for her delay. She brought no news; but held in\r\nher hand the letter that contained the means of freeing them from their\r\nawkward predicament.\r\n\r\n\"We will not stay another minute in this cursed place,\" said Villiers:\r\n\"we will go immediately to Salt Hill, where I intended to take you\r\nto-morrow. I can return by one of the many stages which pass\r\ncontinually, to keep my appointment with Gayland; and be back with you\r\nagain by night. So if these stupid people possess a post-chaise, we will\r\nbe gone directly.\"\r\n\r\nEthel was well pleased with this arrangement; and it was put it\r\nexecution immediately. The chaise and horses were easily procured. They\r\nset Fanny down in their way through town. Ethel tried to repay her\r\nkindness by heartfelt thanks; and she, in her placid way, showed clearly\r\nhow pleased she was to serve them.\r\n\r\nLeaving her in Piccadilly, not far from her own door, they pursued their\r\nway to Salt Hill; and it seemed as if, in this more change of place,\r\nthey had escaped from a kind of prison, to partake again in the\r\nimmunities and comforts of civilized life. Ethel was considerably\r\nfatigued when she arrived; and her husband feared that he had tasked her\r\nstrength too far. The falling and fallen snow clogged up the roads, and\r\ntheir journey had been long. She slept, indeed, the greater part of the\r\nway, her head resting on him; and her languor and physical suffering\r\nwere soothed by emotions the most balmy and by the gladdening sense of\r\nconfidence and security.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at Salt Hill late in the evening. The hours were precious;\r\nfor early on the following day, Villiers was obliged to return to town.\r\nOn inquiry, he found that his best mode was to go by a night-coach from\r\nBath, which would pass at seven in the morning. They were awake half the\r\nnight, talking of their hopes, their plans, their probable deliverance\r\nfrom their besetting annoyances. By this time Ethel had taught her own\r\nphraseology, and Villiers had learned to believe that whatever must\r\nhappen would fall upon both, and that no separation could take place\r\nfraught with any good to either.\r\n\r\nWhen Ethel awoke, late in the morning, Villiers was gone. Her watch told\r\nher, indeed, that it was near ten o'clock, and that he must have\r\ndeparted long before. She felt inclined to reproach him for leaving her,\r\nthough only for a few hours, without an interchange of adieu. In truth,\r\nshe was vexed that he was not there: the world appeared to her so blank,\r\nwithout his voice to welcome her back to it from out of the regions of\r\nsleep. While this slight cloud of ill-humour (may it be called?) was\r\npassing over her mind, she perceived a little note, left by her husband,\r\nlying on her pillow. Kissing it a thousand times, she read its contents,\r\nas if they possessed talismanic power. They breathed the most passionate\r\ntenderness: they besought her, as she loved him, to take care of\r\nherself, and to keep up her spirits until his return, which would be as\r\nspeedy as the dove flies back to its nest, where its sweet mate fondly\r\nexpects him. With these assurances and blessings to cheer her, Ethel\r\narose. The sun poured its wintry yet cheering beams into the parlour,\r\nand the sparkling, snow-clad earth glittered beneath. She wrapped\r\nherself in her cloak, and walked into the garden of the hotel. Long\r\nimmured in London, living as if its fogs were the universal vesture of\r\nall things, her spirits rose to exultation and delight, as she looked on\r\nthe blue sky spread cloudlessly around. As the pure breeze freshened her\r\ncheek, a kind of transport seized her; her spirit took wings; she felt\r\nas if she could float on the bosom of the air--as if there was a\r\nsympathy in nature, whose child and nursling she was, to welcome her\r\nback to her haunts, and to reward her bounteously for coming. The trees,\r\nall leafless and snow-bedecked, were friends and intimates: she kissed\r\ntheir rough barks, and then laughed at her own folly at being so rapt.\r\nThe snow-drop, as it peeped from the ground, was a thing of wonder and\r\nmystery; and the shapes of frost, beautiful forms to be worshipped. All\r\nsorrow--all care passed away, and left her mind as clear and bright as\r\nthe unclouded heavens that bent over her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nHerein\r\nShall my captivity be made my happiness;\r\nSince what I lose in freedom, I regain\r\nWith interest.\r\n\r\nBEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe glow of enthusiasm and gladness, thus kindled in her soul, faded\r\nslowly as the sun descended; and human tenderness returned in full tide\r\nupon her. She longed for Edward to speak to; when would he come back?\r\nShe walked a little way on the London road; she returned: still her\r\npatience was not exhausted. The sun's orb grew red and dusky as it\r\napproached the horizon: she returned to the house. It was yet early:\r\nEdward could not be expected yet: he had promised to come as soon as\r\npossible; but he had prepared her for the likelihood of his arrival only\r\nby the mail at night. It was long since she had written to Saville.\r\nCooped up in town, saddened by her separation from her husband, or\r\nenjoying the brief hours of reunion, she had felt disinclined to write.\r\nHer enlivened spirits now prompted her to pour out some of their\r\noverflowings to him. She did not allude to any of the circumstances of\r\ntheir situation, for Edward had forbidden that topic: still she had much\r\nto say; for her heart was full of benevolence to all mankind; besides\r\nher attachment to her husband, the prospect of becoming a mother within\r\na few months, opened another source of tenderness; there seemed to be a\r\nsuperabundance of happiness within her, a portion of which she desired\r\nto impart to those she loved.\r\n\r\nDaylight had long vanished, and Villiers did not return. She felt\r\nuneasy:--of course he would come by the mail; yet if he should not--what\r\ncould prevent him? Conjectures would force themselves on her,\r\nunreasonable, she told herself; yet her doubts were painful, and she\r\nlistened attentively each time that the sound of wheels grew, and again\r\nfaded, upon her ear. If the vehicle stopped, she was in a state of\r\nexcitation that approached alarm. She knew not what she feared; yet her\r\ndisquiet increased into anxiety. \"Shall I ever see him again?\" were\r\nwords that her lips did not utter, and yet which lingered in her heart,\r\nalthough unaccompanied by any precise idea to her understanding.\r\n\r\nShe had given a thousand messages to the servants;--and at last the mail\r\narrived. She heard a step--it was the waiter:--\"The gentleman is not\r\ncome, ma'am,\" he said. \"I knew it,\" she thought;--\"yet why? why?\" At one\r\ntime she resolved to set off for town; yet whither to go--where to find\r\nhim? An idea struck her, that he had missed the mail; but as he would\r\nnot leave her a prey to uncertainty, he would come by some other\r\nconveyance. She got a little comfort from this notion, and resumed her\r\noccupation of waiting; though the vagueness of her expectations rendered\r\nher a thousand times more restless than before. And all was vain. The\r\nmail had arrived at eleven o'clock--at twelve she retired to her room.\r\nShe read again and again his note: his injunction, that she should take\r\ncare of herself, induced her to go to bed at a little after one; but\r\nsleep was still far from her. Till she could no longer expect--till it\r\nbecame certain that it must be morning before he could come, she did not\r\nclose her eyes. As her last hope quitted her, she wept bitterly. Where\r\nwas the joyousness of the morning?--the exuberant delight with which her\r\nveins had tingled, which had painted life as a blessing? She hid her\r\nface in her pillow, and gave herself up to tears, till sleep at last\r\nstole over her senses.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning her door opened and her curtain was drawn aside.\r\nShe awoke immediately, and saw Fanny Derham standing at her bed-side.\r\n\r\n\"Edward! where is he?\" she exclaimed, starting up.\r\n\r\n\"Well, quite well,\" replied Fanny: \"do not alarm yourself, dear Mrs.\r\nVilliers,--he has been arrested.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must go to him immediately. Leave me for a little while, dear\r\nFanny,--I will dress and come to you; do you order the chaise meanwhile.\r\nI can hear every thing as we are going to town.\"\r\n\r\nEthel trembled violently--her speech was rapid but inarticulate; the\r\npaleness that overspread her face, blanching even her marble brow, and\r\nthe sudden contraction of her features, alarmed Fanny. The words she had\r\nused in communicating her intelligence were cabalistic to Ethel, and her\r\nfears were the more intolerable because mysterious and undefined; the\r\nblood trickled cold in her veins, and a chilly moisture stood on her\r\nforehead. She exerted herself violently to conquer this weakness, but it\r\nshackled her powers, as bands of rope would her limbs, and after a few\r\nmoments she sank back on her pillow almost bereft of life. Fanny sprang\r\nto the bell, then sprinkled her with water; some salts were procured\r\nfrom the landlady, and gradually the colour revisited her cheeks, and\r\nher frame resumed its functions--an hysteric fit, the first she had ever\r\nhad, left her at last exhausted but more composed. She herself became\r\nfrightened lest illness should keep her from Villiers; she exerted\r\nherself to become tranquil, and lay for some time without speaking or\r\nmoving. A little refreshment contributed to restore her, and she turned\r\nto Fanny with a faint sweet smile, \"You see,\" said she, \"what a weak,\r\nfoolish thing I am; but I am well now, quite rallied--there must be no\r\nmore delay.\"\r\n\r\nHer cheerful voice and lively manner gave her friend confidence. Fanny\r\nwas one who believed much in the mastery of mind, and felt sure that\r\nnothing would be so prejudicial to Mrs. Villiers as contradiction, and\r\nobstacles put in the way of her attaining the object of her wishes. In\r\nspite therefore of the good people about, who insisted that the most\r\ndisastrous consequences would ensue, she ordered the horses, and\r\nprepared for their immediate journey to town. Ethel repaid her cares\r\nwith smiles, while she restrained her curiosity, laid as it were a check\r\non her too impatient movements, and forced a calm of manner which gave\r\nher friend courage to proceed.\r\n\r\nIt was not until they were on their way that the object of their journey\r\nwas mentioned. Fanny then spoke of the arrest as a trifling\r\ncircumstance--mentioned bail, and twenty things, which Ethel only\r\ncomprehended to be mysterious methods of setting him free; and then also\r\nshe asked the history of what had happened. The tale was soon told. The\r\nmoment Mr. Villiers had entered Piccadilly he had caused a coach to be\r\ncalled, but on passing to it from the stage, two men entered it with\r\nhim, whose errand was too easily explained. He had driven first to his\r\nsolicitor's, hoping to put every thing in train for his instant\r\nliberation. The day was consumed in these fruitless endeavours--he did\r\nnot give up hope till past ten at night, when he sent to Fanny, asking\r\nher to go down to Mrs. Villiers as early as possible in the morning, and\r\nto bring her up to town. His wish was, he said, that Ethel should take\r\nup her abode at Mrs. Derham's till this affair could be arranged, and\r\nthey were enabled to leave London. His note was hurried; he promised\r\nthat another, more explicit, should await his wife on her arrival.\r\n\r\n\"You will tell the driver,\" said Ethel, when this story was finished,\r\n\"to drive to Edward's prison. I would not stay away five minutes from\r\nhim in his present situation to purchase the universe.\"\r\n\r\nAny one but Miss Derham might have resisted Ethel's wish--have argued\r\nwith her, and irritated her by the display of obstacles and\r\ninconveniences. It was not Fanny's method ever to oppose the desires of\r\nothers. They knew best, she affirmed, their own sensations, and what was\r\nmost fitting for them. What is best for me, habit, education, and a\r\ndifferent texture of character, may render the worst for them. In the\r\npresent instance, also, she saw that Ethel's feelings were almost too\r\nhigh wrought for her strength--that opposition, by making a further call\r\non her powers, might upset them wholly. She had besides, the deepest\r\nrespect for her attachment to her husband, and was willing to reward it\r\nby bringing her to him without delay. Having thus fortunately fallen\r\ninto reasonable hands, guided by one who could understand her character,\r\nand not torture her by forcing notions the opposite of those on which\r\nshe felt herself compelled to act, Ethel became tranquil, and saw the\r\nmere panic of inexperience in her previous excessive alarm.\r\n\r\nThey now approached London. Fanny called the post-boy to the window of\r\nthe chaise, and gave him directions, at which he a little stared, but\r\nsaid nothing. She gave things their own names, and never dreamt of\r\nsaving appearances, as it is called. What ought to be done, that she\r\ndared do in the face of the whole world, and therefore to make a mystery\r\nof their destination never once occurred to her. They drove through the\r\nlong interminable suburbs--through Piccadilly and the Strand. Ethel's\r\ncheeks flushed with the excitement, and something like apprehension made\r\nher heart flutter. She had endeavoured to form an image in her own mind\r\nof whither they were going--it was vague and therefore frightful--but\r\nEdward was there, and she also would share the horrors of his\r\nprison-house.\r\n\r\nThey passed through Temple Bar, and going down an obscure street or two,\r\nstopped at a dingy door-way. \"This is not right,\" said Ethel, almost\r\ngasping for breath, \"this is not a prison.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something very like it, as you will find too soon,\" said her friend.\r\n\r\nStill Ethel's imagination was relieved by the absence of the massy\r\nwalls, the portentous gates, the gloomy immensity of an absolute prison.\r\nThe door of the house being opened, Ethel stepped out from the chaise\r\nand asked for Mr. Villiers. The man whom she addressed hesitated, but\r\nEthel had learnt one only worldly lesson, which was, whenever she needed\r\nthe services of people of the lower orders, to disseminate money\r\nplentifully. Her purse was in her hand, and she gave a sovereign to the\r\nman, who then at once showed them upstairs; which she ascended, though\r\nevery limb nearly refused to perform its office as she approached the\r\nspot where again she was to find--to see him, whose image lived\r\neternally in her heart, and whom it was the sole joy of her life to wait\r\non, to be sheltered by, to live near.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened. In the dingy, dusty room, beside the fire, which\r\nlooked as if it could not burn, and was never meant to warm even the\r\nblack neglected grate, Villiers sat, reading. His first emotion was\r\nshame when he saw Ethel enter. There was no accord between her spotless\r\nloveliness and his squalid prison-room. Any one who has seen a sunbeam\r\nsuddenly enter and light up a scene of housewifely neglect, and vulgar\r\ndiscomfort, and felt how obtrusive it rendered all that might be\r\nhalf-forgotten in the shade, can picture how the simple elegance of\r\nEthel displayed yet more distinctly to her husband the worse than\r\nbeggarly scene in which she found him. His cheeks flushed, and almost he\r\nwould have turned away. He would have reproached, but a tenderness and\r\nan elevation of feeling animated her expressive countenance, which\r\nturned the current of his thoughts. Whether it were their fate to suffer\r\nthe extremes of fortune in the savage wilderness, or in the more\r\nappalling privations of civilized life--love, and the poetry of love\r\naccompanied her, and gilded, and irradiated the commonest forms of\r\npenury. She looked at him, and her eyes then glanced to the barred\r\nwindows. As Fanny and their conductor left them, she heard the key turn\r\nin the lock with an impertinent intrusive loudness. She felt pained for\r\nhim, but for herself it was as if the world and all its cares were\r\nlocked out, and as if in this near association with him, she reaped the\r\nreward of all her previous anxiety. There was no repining in her\r\nthoughts, no dejection in her manner; Villiers could read in her open\r\ncountenance, as plainly as through the clearest crystal, the sentiments\r\nthat were passing in her mind--it was something more satisfied than\r\nresignation, more contented than fortitude. It was a knowledge that\r\nwhatever evil might attend her lot, the good so far outweighed it, that,\r\nfor his sake only, could she advert to any feeling of distress. It was a\r\nconsciousness of being in her place, and of fulfilling her duty,\r\naccompanied by a sort of rapture in remembering how thrice dear and\r\nhallowed that duty was. Angels could not feel as she did, for they\r\ncannot sacrifice to those they love; yet there was in her that absence\r\nof all self-emanating pain, which is the characteristic of what we are\r\ntold of the angelic essences.\r\n\r\nAs when at night autumnal winds are howling, and vast masses of winged\r\nclouds are driven with indescribable speed across the sky--we note the\r\nislands of dark ether, built round by the white fleecy shapes; and as we\r\nmark the stars which gem their unfathomable depth, silence and sublime\r\ntranquillity appear to have found a home in that deep vault, and we love\r\nto dwell on the peace and beauty that live there, while the clouds still\r\nrush on, and the face of the lower heaven is more mutable than water.\r\nThus the mind of Ethel, surrounded by the world's worst forms of\r\nadversity, showed clear and serene, entirely possessed by the repose of\r\nlove. It was impossible but that, in spite of shame and regret, Villiers\r\nshould not participate in these feelings. He gave himself up to the\r\nsoftening influence: he knew not how to repine on his own account;\r\nEthel's affection demanded to stand in place of prosperity, and he could\r\nnot refuse to admit so dear a claim.\r\n\r\nThe door had closed on them, and every outlet to liberty, or the\r\nenjoyment of life, was barred up. Edward drew Ethel towards him and\r\nkissed her fondly. Their eyes met, and the speechless tenderness that\r\nbeamed from hers reached his heart and soothed every ruffled feeling.\r\nSitting together, and interchanging a few words of comfort and hope,\r\nmingled with kind looks and affectionate caresses, they neither of them\r\nremembered indignity nor privation. The tedious mechanism of civilized\r\nlife, and the odious interference of their fellow-creatures were\r\nforgotten, and they were happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nVeggo pur troppo\r\nChe favola \u00e8 la vita,\r\nE la favola mia non \u00e8 compita.\r\n\r\nPETRARCA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe darker months of winter had passed away, and the chilly, blighting\r\nEnglish spring begun. Towards the end of March Lady Lodore came to town.\r\nShe had long ago, in her days of wealth, fitted up a house in Park Lane, so\r\nshe returned to it, as to a home--if home it might be called--where no\r\none welcomed her--where none sat beside her at the domestic hearth.\r\n\r\nFor the first time she felt keenly this circumstance. During her\r\nmother's lifetime she had had her constantly for a companion, and\r\nafterwards as events pressed upon her, and while the anguish she felt\r\nupon Horatio Saville's marriage was still fresh, she had not reverted to\r\nher lonely position as the source of pain.\r\n\r\nThe haughty, the firm, the self-exalting soul of Cornelia had borne up\r\nlong. She had often felt that she walked on the borders of a precipice,\r\nand that if once she admitted sentiments of regret, she should plunge\r\nwithout retrieve into a gulph, dark, portentous, inextricable. She had\r\noften repeated to herself that fate should not vanquish her, and that in\r\nspite of despair she would be happy: it is true that the misery\r\noccasioned by Saville's marriage was a canker at her heart, for which\r\nthere was no cure, but she had recourse to dissipation that she might\r\nendeavour to forget it. A sad and ineffectual remedy. She was surrounded\r\nby admirers, whom she disdained, and by friends to whom she would have\r\ndied rather than betray the naked misery of her soul. She had never\r\nplanned nor thought of marriage. The report concerning the Earl of\r\nD----was one of those which the world always makes current, when two\r\npersons of opposite sexes are, by any chance, thrown much together. His\r\nsister was Lady Lodore's friend, and she had chaperoned her, and been of\r\nassistance to her, during the courtship of the gentleman who was at\r\npresent her husband. It was their house that Lady Lodore had just\r\nquitted on arriving in town. The new-born happiness of early wedded life\r\nhad been a scene to call her back to thoughts which were the sources of\r\nthe bitterest anguish. She abhorred herself that she could envy, that\r\nshe could desire to exchange places with, any created being. She\r\nabridged her visit, and fancied that she should regain peace in the\r\nindependence of her own home. But the enjoyment of liberty was cold in\r\nher heart, and loneliness added a freezing chilliness to her feeling.\r\n\r\nThe mind of Cornelia was much above the world she lived in, though she\r\nhad sacrificed all to it; and, so to speak, much above herself. Take\r\npride from her, and there was understanding, magnanimity, and great\r\nkindliness of disposition: but pride had been the wall of China to shut\r\nup all her better qualities, and to keep them from communicating with\r\nthe world beyond;--pride, which grew strong by resistance, and towered\r\nabove every aggressor;--pride, which crumbled away, when time and change\r\nwere its sole assailants, till her inner being was left unprotected and\r\nbare.\r\n\r\nShe found herself alone in the world. She felt that her life was\r\naimless, unprofitable, blank. She was humiliated and saddened by her\r\nrelative position in the world. She did not think of her daughter as a\r\nresource; she was in the hands of her enemies, and no hope lay there.\r\nShe entertained the belief that Mrs. Villiers was weak both in character\r\nand understanding; and that to make any attempt to interest herself in\r\nher, would end in disappointment, if not disgust. Imagining, as we are\r\nall apt to do, how we should act in another person's place, she had\r\nformed a notion of what she would have done, had she been Ethel; and as\r\nnothing was done, she almost despised, and quite pitied her. No! there\r\nwas no help. She was alone;--none loved, none cared for her; and the\r\nflower of the field, which a child plucks and wears for an hour, and\r\nthen casts aside, was of more worth than she.\r\n\r\nEvery amusement grew tedious--all society vacant and dull. When she came\r\nback from dinners or assemblies, to her luxurious but empty abode, the\r\ndarkest thoughts, engendered by spleen, hung over its threshold, and\r\nwelcomed her return. At such times, she would dismiss her attendant, and\r\nremain half the night by her fireside, encouraging sickly reveries,\r\nstruggling with the fate that bound her, yet unable in any way to make\r\nan effort for freedom.\r\n\r\n\"Time\"--thus would her thoughts fashion themselves--\"yes, time rolls on,\r\nand what does it bring? I live in a desert; its barren sands feed my\r\nhour-glass, and they come out fruitless as they went in. Months change\r\ntheir names--years their cyphers: my brow is sadly trenched; the bloom\r\nof youth is faded: my mind gathers wrinkles. What will become of me?\r\n\r\n\"Hopes of my youth, where are ye?--my aspirations, my pride, my belief\r\nthat I could grasp and possess all things? Alas! there is nothing of all\r\nthis! My soul lies in the dust; and I look up to know that I have been\r\nplaying with shadows, and that I am fallen for ever! What do I see\r\naround me? The tide of life is ebbing fast! I had fancied that pearls\r\nand gold would have been left by the retiring waves; and I find only\r\nbarren, lonely sands! No voice reaches me from across the waters--no one\r\nstands beside me on the shore! Would--O would I could lay my head on the\r\nspray-sprinkled beach, and sleep for ever!\r\n\r\n\"This is madness!--these incoherent images that throng my brain are the\r\nravings of insanity!--yet what greater madness, than to know that love,\r\naffection, the charities of life, the hopes of existence, are empty\r\nwords for me. Am I indeed to have done with these? What is it that still\r\nmoves up and down in my soul, making me feel as if something might yet\r\nbe accomplished? Is it that the ardour of youth is not yet tamed? Alas!\r\nmy youth has departed for ever. Yet wherefore these sighs, which wrap an\r\neternity of wretchedness in their evanescent breath?--why these tears,\r\nthat, flowing from the inmost fountains of the soul, endeavour to give\r\npassage to the flood of sorrow that deluges and overwhelms it? The\r\nhusband of my youth!--the thought of him passes like a shadow across me!\r\nHad he borne with me a little longer--had I submitted to his\r\ncontroul--how different my destiny had been! But I will not think of\r\nthat--I do not! A mightier storm than any he could raise has swept\r\nacross me since, and laid all waste. My soul has been set upon a hope,\r\nwhich has vanished, and desolation has come in its room. Could God, in\r\nhis anger, bestow a bitterer curse on a condemned spirit, than that\r\nwhich weighs on me, when I reflect, that through my own fault I lost\r\nhim, whom but to see was paradise? The thought haunts me like a crime;\r\nyet when is it absent from me?--it sleeps with me, rises with me--it is\r\nby me now, and I would willingly die only to dismiss it for ever.\r\n\r\n\"Miserable Cornelia! Thou hast been courted, lauded, waited on,\r\nloved!--it is all over! I am alone! My poor, poor mother!--my much\r\nreviled, my dearest mother!--by you, at least, I was valued! Ah! why are\r\nyou gone, leaving your wretched child alone?\r\n\r\n\"O that I could take wings and rise from out of the abyss into which I\r\nam fallen! Can I not, myself being miserable, take pleasure in the\r\npleasure of others; and by force of strong sympathy, forget my selfish\r\nwoes? With whom can I sympathize? None desire my care, and all would\r\nrepay my officiousness with ingratitude, perhaps with scorn. Once I\r\ncould assist the poor; now I am poor myself: my limited means scarce\r\nsuffice to keep me in that station in society, from which, did I once\r\ndescend, I were indeed trampled upon and destroyed for ever. Tears rush\r\nfrom my eyes--my heart sinks within me, as I look forward. Again the\r\nsame cares, the same coil, the same bitter result. Hopes held out, only\r\nto be crushed; affections excited, only to be scattered to the winds. I\r\nblamed myself for struggling too much with fate, for rowing against wind\r\nand tide, for resolving to controul the events that form existence: now\r\nI yield--I have long yielded--I have let myself drift, as I hoped, into\r\na quiet creek, where indifference and peace ruled the hour; and lo! it\r\nis a whirlpool, to swallow all I had left of enjoyment upon earth!\"\r\n\r\nIt was not until she had exhausted herself by these gloomy and restless\r\nreflections, that she laid her head upon her pillow, and tried to sleep.\r\nMorning usually dawned before she closed her eyes; and it was nearly\r\nnoon before she rose, weary and unrefreshed. It was with a struggle that\r\nshe commenced a new day--a day that was to be cheered by no event nor\r\nfeeling capable of animating her to any sense of joy. She had never\r\noccupied herself by intellectual exertion: her employments had been the\r\ncultivation of what are called accomplishments merely; and when now she\r\nreverted to these, it was with bitterness. She remembered the interval\r\nwhen she had been inspirited by the delightful wish to please Horatio.\r\nNow none cared how the forlorn Cornelia passed her time;--no one would\r\nhang enraptured on her voice, or hail with gladness the developement of\r\nsome new talent. \"It is the same,\" she thought, \"how I get rid of the\r\nheavy hours, so that they go. I have but to give myself up to the\r\nsluggish stream that bears me on to old age, not more bereft or\r\nunregarded than these wretched years.\"\r\n\r\nThus she lingered idly through the morning; her only enjoyment being,\r\nwhen she secured to herself a solitary drive, and reclining back in her\r\ncarriage, felt herself safe from every intrusion, and yet enjoying a\r\nsuccession of objects, that a little varied the tenor of her thoughts.\r\nShe had deserted the park, and sought unfrequented drives in the\r\nenvirons of London. Evening at last came, and with it her uninteresting\r\nengagements, which yet she found better than entire seclusion. Forced to\r\nrouse herself to adopt, as a mask, the smiling appearance which had been\r\nnatural to her for many years, she often abhorred every one around her;\r\nand yet, hating herself more, took refuge among them, from her own\r\nsociety. Her chief care was to repress any manifestation of her despair,\r\nwhich too readily rose to her lips or in her eyes. The glorious hues of\r\nsunset--the subduing sounds of music--even the sight of a beautiful\r\ngirl, resplendent with happiness and youth, moving gracefully in\r\ndance--had power to move her to tears: her blood seemed to curdle and\r\ngrow thick, while gloomy shadows mantled over her features. Often, she\r\ncould scarcely forbear expressing the bitterness of her feelings, and\r\nindulging in acrimonious remarks on the deceits of life, and the inanity\r\nof all things. It seemed to her, sometimes, that she must die if she did\r\nnot give vent to the still increasing horror with which she regarded the\r\nwhole system of the world.\r\n\r\nNor were her sufferings always thus negative. One evening, especially, a\r\nyoung travelled gentleman approached her, with all the satisfaction\r\npainted on his countenance, which he felt at having secured a topic for\r\nthe entertainment of the fashionable Lady Lodore.\r\n\r\n\"You are intimate with the Misses Saville,\" he said; \"what charming\r\ngirls they are! I have just left them at Naples, where they have been\r\nspending the carnival. I saw them almost every day, and capitally we\r\nenjoyed ourselves. Their Italian sister-in-law spirited them up to mask,\r\nand to make a real carnival of it. A most lovely woman that. Did you\r\never see Mrs. Saville, Lady Lodore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" replied his auditress.\r\n\r\n\"Such eyes! Gazelles, and stars, and suns, and the whole range of poetic\r\nimagery, might be sought in vain, to do justice to her large dark eyes.\r\nShe is very young--scarcely twenty: and to see her with her child, is\r\npositively a finer tableau than any Raphael or Correggio in the world.\r\nShe has a little girl, not a year old, with golden hair, and eyes as\r\nblack as the mother's--the most beautiful little thing, and so\r\nintelligent. Saville doats on it: no wonder--he is not himself handsome,\r\nyou know; though the lovely Clorinda would stab me if she heard me say\r\nso. She positively adores him. You should have seen them together.\"\r\n\r\nLady Lodore turned on him one of her sweetest smiles, and in her blandest\r\ntone, said, \"If you could only get me an ice from that servant, who I see\r\nimmovable behind those dear, wonderful dowagers, you would so oblige\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nHe was gone in a minute; and on his return, Lady Lodore was so deeply\r\nengrossed in being persuaded to go to the next drawing room, by the young\r\nand new-married Countess of G--, that she could only reward him with\r\nanother heavenly smile. He was obliged to take his carnival at Naples to\r\nsome other listener.\r\n\r\nCornelia scarcely closed her eyes that night. The thought of the happy\r\nwife and lovely child of Saville, pierced her as with remorse. She had\r\nentirely broken off her acquaintance with his family, so that she was\r\nignorant of Clorinda's disposition, and readily fancied that she was as\r\nhappy as she believed that the wife of Horatio Saville must be. She\r\nwould not acknowledge that she was wicked enough to repine at her\r\nfelicity; but that he should be rendered happy by any other woman than\r\nherself--that any other woman should have become the sharer of his\r\ndearest affections, stung her to the core. Yet why should she regret?\r\nShe were well exchanged for one so lovely and so young. At the age of\r\nthirty-four, which she had now reached, Cornelia persuaded herself, that\r\nthe name of beauty was a mockery as applied to her--though her own glass\r\nmight have told her otherwise; for time had dealt lightly with her, so\r\nthat the extreme fascination of her manner, and the animation and\r\nintelligence of her countenance, made her compete with many younger\r\nbeauties. She felt that she was deteriorated from the angelic being she\r\nhad seemed when she first appeared as Lodore's bride; and this made all\r\ncompliments show false and vain. Now she figured to herself the dark\r\neyes of the Neapolitan; and easily believed that the memory of her would\r\ncontrast, like a faded picture, with the rich hues of Clorinda's face;\r\nwhile her sad and withered feelings were in yet greater opposition to\r\nthe vivacity she had heard described and praised--to the triumphant and\r\nglad feelings of a beloved wife. It seemed to her as if she must weep\r\nfor ever, and yet that tears were unavailing to diminish in any degree\r\nthe sorrow that weighed so heavily at her heart. These reflections sat\r\nlike a night-mare on her pillow, troubling the repose she in vain\r\ncourted. She arose in the morning, scarcely conscious that she had slept\r\nat all--languid from exhaustion--her sufferings blunted by their very\r\nexcess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nO, where have I been all this time? How 'friended\r\nThat I should lose myself thus desp'rately.\r\nAnd none for pity show me how I wandered!\r\n\r\nBEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile it was yet too early for visitors, and before she had ordered\r\nherself to be denied to every one, as she intended to do, she was\r\nsurprised by a double knock at the door, and she rang hastily to prevent\r\nany one being admitted. The servants, with contradictory orders, found\r\nit difficult to evade the earnest desire of the visitor to see their\r\nlady; and at last they brought up a card, on which was written, \"Miss\r\nDerham wishes to be permitted to see Lady Lodore for Mrs. Villiers.\"\r\n_From_ had first been written, erased, and _for_ substituted. Lady Lodore\r\nwas alarmed; and the ideas of danger and death instantly presenting\r\nthemselves, she desired Miss Derham to be shown up. She met her with a\r\nface of anxiety, and with that frankness and kindness of manner which\r\nwas the irresistible sceptre she wielded to subdue all hearts. Fanny had\r\nhitherto disliked Lady Lodore. She believed her to be cold, worldly, and\r\nselfish--now, in a moment, she was convinced, by the powerful influence\r\nof manner, that she was the contrary of all this; so that instead of the\r\nchilling address she meditated, she was impelled to throw off her\r\nreserve, and to tell her story with animation and detail. She spoke of\r\nwhat Mrs. Villiers had gone through previous to the arrest of her\r\nhusband--and how constantly she had kept her resolve of remaining with\r\nhim--though her situation day by day becoming more critical, demanded\r\nattentions and luxuries which she had no means of attaining. \"Yet,\" said\r\nFanny, \"I should not have intruded on you even now, but that they cannot\r\ngo on as they are; their resources are utterly exhausted,--and until\r\nnext June I see no prospect for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why does not Mr. Villiers apply to his father? even if letters were of\r\nno avail, a personal appeal--\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that Colonel Villiers has\r\nnothing to give,\" replied Fanny, \"and at all events, Mr. Villiers's\r\nimprisonment--\"\r\n\r\n\"Prison!\" cried Lady Lodore, \"you do not mean--Ethel cannot be\r\nliving in prison!\"\r\n\r\n\"They live within the rules, if you understand that term. They rent a\r\nlodging close to the prison on the other side of the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"This must indeed be altered,\" said Lady Lodore, \"this is far too\r\nshocking--poor Ethel, she must come here! Dear Miss Derham, will you\r\ntell her how much I desire to see her, and entreat her to make my house\r\nher home.\"\r\n\r\nFanny shook head. \"She will not leave her husband--I should make your\r\nproposal in vain.\"\r\n\r\nLady Lodore looked incredulous. After a moment's thought she persuaded\r\nherself that Ethel's having refused to return to the house of Mrs. Derham,\r\nor having negatived some other proposed kindness originated this notion,\r\nand she believed that she had only to make her invitation in the most\r\ngracious possible way, not to have it refused. \"I will go to Ethel\r\nmyself,\" she said; \"I will myself bring her here, and so smooth all\r\ndifficulties.\"\r\n\r\nFanny did not object. Under her new favourable opinion of Lady Lodore, she\r\nfelt that all would be well if the mother and daughter were brought\r\ntogether, though only for a few minutes. She wrote down Ethel's address,\r\nand took her leave, while at the same moment Lady Lodore ordered her\r\ncarriage, and assured her that no time should be lost in removing Mrs.\r\nVilliers to a more suitable abode.\r\n\r\nLady Lodore's feelings on this occasion were not so smiling as her looks.\r\nShe was grieved for her daughter, but she was exceedingly vexed for\r\nherself. She had desired some interest, some employment in life, but she\r\nrecoiled from any that should link her with Ethel. She desired occupation,\r\nand not slavery; but to bring the young wife to her own house, and make it\r\na home for her, was at once destructive of her own independence. She\r\nlooked forward with repugnance to the familiarity that must thence ensue\r\nbetween her and Villiers. Even the first step was full of annoyance, and\r\nshe was displeased that Fanny had given her the task of going to her\r\ndaughter's habitation, and forced her to appear personally on so\r\ndegrading a scene; there was however no help--she had undertaken it, and\r\nit must be done.\r\n\r\nEvery advance she made towards the wretched part of the town where Ethel\r\nlived, added to her ill-humour. She felt almost personally affronted by\r\nthe necessity she was under of first coming in contact with her daughter\r\nunder such disastrous circumstances. Her spleen against Lord Lodore\r\nrevived: she viewed every evil that had ever befallen her, as arising from\r\nhis machinations. If Ethel had been entrusted to her guardianship, she\r\ncertainly had never become the wife of Edward Villiers--nor ever have\r\ntasted the dregs of opprobrious poverty.\r\n\r\nAt length, her carriage drew near a row of low, shabby houses; and as\r\nthe name caught her eye she found that she had reached her destination.\r\nShe resolved not to see Villiers, if it could possibly be avoided; and\r\nthen making up her mind to perform her part with grace, and every show\r\nof kindness, she made an effort to smooth her brow and recall her\r\nsmiles. The carriage stopped at a door--a servant-maid answered to the\r\nknock. She ordered Mr. Villiers to be asked for; he was not at home. One\r\nobjection to her proceeding was removed by this answer. Mrs. Villiers\r\nwas in the house, and she alighted and desired to be shown to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nAs flowers beneath May's footsteps waken\r\nAs stars from night's loose hair are shaken;\r\nAs waves arise when loud winds call,\r\nThoughts sprung where'er that step did fall.\r\n\r\nSHELLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever before had the elegant and fastidious Lady Lodore entered such an\r\nabode, or ascended such stairs. The servant had told her to enter the room\r\nat the head of the first flight, so she made her way by herself, and\r\nknocked at the door. The voice that told her to come in, thrilled\r\nthrough her, she knew not why, and she became disturbed at finding that\r\nher self-possession was failing her. Slight things act powerfully on the\r\nsubtle mechanism of the human mind. She had dressed with scrupulous\r\nplainness, yet her silks and furs were strangely contrasted with the\r\nroom she entered, and she felt ashamed of all the adjuncts of wealth and\r\nluxury that attended her. She opened the door with an effort: Ethel was\r\nseated near the fire at work--no place or circumstance could deteriorate\r\nfrom her appearance--in her simple, unadorned morning-dress, she looked\r\nas elegant and as distinguished as she had done when her mother had last\r\nseen her in diamonds and plumes in the presence of royalty. There was\r\na charm about both, strikingly in contrast, and yet equal in\r\nfascination--the polish of Lady Lodore, and the simplicity of Ethel were\r\nboth manifestations of inward grace and dignity; and as they now met, it\r\nwould have been difficult to say which had the advantage of the other.\r\nEthel's extreme youth, by adding to the interest with which she must be\r\nregarded, was in her favour. Yet full of sensibility and loveliness as\r\nwas her face, she had never been, nor was she even now, as strikingly\r\nbeautiful as her mother.\r\n\r\nLady Lodore could not restrain the tear that started into her eye on\r\nbeholding her daughter situated as she was. Ethel's feelings, on the\r\ncontrary, were all gladness. She had no pride to allay her gratitude for\r\nher mother's kindness. \"How very good of you to come!\" she said, \"how could\r\nyou find out where we were?\"\r\n\r\n\"How long have you been here?\" asked Lady Lodore, looking round the\r\nwretched little room.\r\n\r\n\"Only a few weeks--I assure you it is not so bad as it seems. I should\r\nnot much mind it, but that Edward feels it so deeply on my account.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wonder,\" said her mother, \"he must be cut to the soul--but\r\nthank God it is over now. You shall come to me immediately, my house is\r\nquite large enough to accommodate you--I am come to fetch you.\"\r\n\r\n\"My own dearest mother!\"--the words scarcely formed themselves on\r\nEthel's lips; she half feared to offend the lovely woman before her by\r\nshowing her a daughter's affection.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, call me mother,\" said Lady Lodore; \"I may, at last, I hope, be\r\nallowed to prove myself one. Come then, dear Ethel, you will not refuse my\r\nrequest--you will come with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"How gladly--but--will they let Edward go? I thought there was no hope\r\nof so much good fortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear indeed,\" replied her mother, \"that Mr. Villiers must endure the\r\nannoyance of remaining here a little longer; but I hope his affairs will\r\nsoon be arranged.\"\r\n\r\nEthel bent her large eyes inquiringly on her mother, as if not\r\nunderstanding; and then, as her meaning opened on her, a smile diffused\r\nitself over her countenance as she said, \"Your intentions are the\r\nkindest in the world--I am grateful, how far more grateful than I can at\r\nall express, for your goodness. That you have had the kindness to come\r\nto this odious place is more than I could ever dare expect.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not worth your thanks, although I think I deserve your\r\nacquiescence to my proposal. You will come home with me?\"\r\n\r\nEthel shook her head, smilingly. \"All my wishes are accomplished,\" she\r\nsaid, \"through this kind visit. I would not have you for the world come\r\nhere again; but the wall between us is broken down, and we shall not\r\nbecome strangers again.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dearest Ethel,\" said Lady Lodore, seriously, \"I see what you mean. I\r\nwish Mr. Villiers were here to advocate my cause. You must come with me--he\r\nwill be much more at ease when you are no longer forced to share his\r\nannoyances. This is in every way an unfit place for you, especially at\r\nthis time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall appear ungrateful, I fear,\" replied Ethel, \"if I assure you how\r\nmuch better off I am here than I could be any where else in the world.\r\nThis place appears miserable to you--so I dare say it is; to me it seems\r\nto possess every requisite for happiness, and were it not so, I would\r\nrather live in an actual dungeon with Edward, than in the most splendid\r\nmansion in England, away from him.\"\r\n\r\nHer face was lighted up with such radiance as she spoke--there was so\r\nmuch fervour in her voice--such deep affection in her speaking\r\neyes--such an earnest demonstration of heartfelt sincerity, that Lady\r\nLodore was confounded and overcome. Swift, as if a map had been unrolled\r\nbefore her, the picture of her own passed life was retraced in her\r\nmind--its loneless and unmeaning pursuits--and the bitter disappointments\r\nthat had blasted every hope of seeing better days. She burst into tears.\r\nEthel was shocked and tried to soothe her by caresses and assurances of\r\ngratitude and affection. \"And yet you will not come with me?\" said Lady\r\nLodore, making an effort to resume her self-command.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot. It is impossible for me voluntarily to separate myself from\r\nEdward--I am too weak, too great a coward.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is there no hope of liberation for him?\" This question of Lady\r\nLodore forced them back to matter-of-fact topics, and she became composed.\r\nEthel related how ineffectual every endeavour had yet been to arrange\r\nhis affairs, how large his debts, how inexorable his creditors, how\r\nneglectful his attorney.\r\n\r\n\"And his father?\" inquired her mother.\r\n\r\n\"He seems to me to be kind-hearted,\" replied Ethel, \"and to feel deeply\r\nhis son's situation; but he has no means--he himself is in want.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is keeping a carriage at this moment in Paris,\" said Lady Lodore, \"and\r\ngiving parties--however, I allow that that is no proof of his having\r\nmoney. Still you must not stay here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor shall we always,\" replied Ethel; \"something of course will happen\r\nto take us away, though as yet it is all hopeless enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aunt Bessy, Mrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry, might give you assistance. Have\r\nyou asked her?--has she refused?\"\r\n\r\n\"Edward has exacted a promise from me not to reveal our perplexities to\r\nher--he is punctilious about money obligations, and I have given my word\r\nnot to hurt his delicacy on that point.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then that, perhaps, is the reason why you refused my request to go home\r\nwith me?\" said Lady Lodore reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Ethel, \"I do not think that he is so scrupulous as to\r\nprevent a mother from serving her child, but he shall answer for\r\nhimself; I expect him back from his walk every minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then forgive me if I run away,\" said Lady Lodore; \"I am not fit to see him\r\nnow. Better times will come, dearest Ethel, and we shall meet again. God\r\nbless you, my child, as so much virtue and patience deserve to be blest.\r\nRemember me with kindness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not you forget me,\" replied Ethel, \"or rather, do not think of me\r\nand my fortunes with too much disgust. We shall meet again, I hope?\"\r\n\r\nLady Lodore kissed her, and hurried away. Scarcely was she in her carriage\r\nthan she saw Villiers advancing: his prepossessing appearance, ingenuous\r\ncountenance, and patrician figure, made more intelligible to her\r\nworld-practised eyes the fond fidelity of his wife. She drew up the\r\nwindow that he might not see her, as she gave her directions for \"home,\"\r\nand then retreating to the corner of her carriage, she tried to compose\r\nher thoughts, and to reflect calmly on what was to be done.\r\n\r\nBut the effort was vain. The further she was removed from the strange\r\nscene of the morning, the more powerfully did it act on, and agitate her\r\nmind. Her soul was in tumults. This was the being she had pitied, almost\r\ndespised! Her eager imagination now exalted her into an angel. There was\r\nsomething heart-moving in the gentle patience, and unrepining\r\ncontentment with which she bore her hard lot. She appeared in her eyes\r\nto be one of those rare examples sent upon earth to purify human nature,\r\nand to demonstrate how near akin to perfection we can become. Latent\r\nmaternal pride might increase her admiration, and maternal tenderness\r\nadd to its warmth. Her nature had acknowledged its affinity to her\r\nchild, and she felt drawn towards her with inexpressible yearnings. A\r\nvehement desire to serve her sprung up--but all was confused and\r\ntumultuous. She pressed her hand on her forehead, as if so to restrain\r\nthe strong current of thought. She compressed her lips, so to repress\r\nher tears.\r\n\r\nArrived at home, she found herself in prison within the walls of her\r\nchamber. She abhorred its gilding and luxury--she longed for Ethel's\r\nscant abode and glorious privations. To alleviate her restlessness, she\r\nagain drove out, and directed her course through the Regent's Park, and\r\nalong the new road to Hampstead, where she was least liable to meet any\r\none she knew. It was one of the first fine days of spring. The green\r\nmeadows, the dark boughs swelling and bursting into bud, the fresh\r\nenlivening air, the holiday of nature's birth--all this was lost on her,\r\nor but added to her agitation. Still her thoughts were with her child in\r\nher narrow abode; every lovely object served but to recall her image,\r\nand the wafting of the soft breeze seemed an emanation from her. It was\r\ndark before she came back, and sent a hurried note of excuse to the\r\nhouse where she was to have dined. \"No more, O never more,\" she cried,\r\n\"will I so waste my being, but learn from Ethel to be happy, and to\r\nlove.\"\r\n\r\nMany thoughts and many schemes thronged her brain. Something must be\r\ndone, or her heart would burst. Pride, affection, repentance, all\r\noccupied the same channel, and increased the flood that swept away every\r\nidea but one. Her very love for Horatio, true and engrossing as it had\r\nbeen, the source of many tears and endless regrets, appeared as slight\r\nas the web of gossamer, compared to the chain that bound her to her\r\ndaughter. She could not herself understand, nor did she wish to know,\r\nwhence and why this enthusiasm had risen like an exhalation in her soul,\r\ncovering and occupying its entire space. She only knew it was there,\r\ninterpenetrating, paramount. Ethel's dark eyes and silken curls, her\r\nsweet voice and heavenly smile, formed a moving, speaking picture, which\r\nshe felt that it were bliss to contemplate for ever. She retired at last\r\nto bed, but not to rest; and as she lay with open eyes, thinking not of\r\nsleep--alive in every pore--her brain working with ten thousand\r\nthoughts, one at last grew more importunate than the rest, and demanded\r\nall her attention. Her ideas became more consecutive, though not less\r\nrapid and imperious. She drew forth in prospect, as it were, a map of\r\nwhat was to be done, and the results. Her mind became fixed, and\r\nsensations of ineffable pleasure accompanied her reveries. She was\r\nresolved to sacrifice every thing to her daughter--to liberate Villiers,\r\nand to establish her in ease and comfort. The image of self-sacrifice,\r\nand of the ruin of her own fortunes, was attended with a kind of\r\nrapture. She felt as if, in securing Ethel's happiness, she could never\r\nfeel sorrow more. This was something worth living for: the burden of\r\nlife was gone--its darkness dissipated--a soft light invested all\r\nthings, and angels' voices invited her to proceed. While indulging in\r\nthese reveries, she sunk into a balmy sleep--such a one she had not\r\nenjoyed for many months--nay, her whole past life had never afforded her\r\nso sweet a joy. The thoughts of love, when she believed that she should\r\nbe united to Saville, were not so blissful; for self-approbation,\r\nderived from a consciousness of virtue and well-doing, hallowed every\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nLike gentle rains on the dry plains,\r\nMaking that green which late was grey;\r\nOr like the sudden moon, that stains\r\nSome gloomy chamber's window panes,\r\nWith a broad light like day.\r\n\r\nSHELLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow mysterious a thing is the action of repentance in the human mind! We\r\nwill not dive into the debasing secrets of remorse for guilt. Lady Lodore\r\ncould accuse herself of none. Yet when she looked back, a new light shone\r\non the tedious maze in which she had been lost; a light--and she blessed\r\nit--that showed her a pathway out of tempest and confusion into serenity\r\nand peace. She wondered at her previous blindness; it was as if she had\r\nclosed her eyelids, and then fancied it was night. No fear that she\r\nshould return to darkness; her heart felt so light, her spirit so clear\r\nand animated, that she could only wonder how it was she had missed\r\nhappiness so long, when it needed only that she should stretch out her\r\nhand to take it.\r\n\r\nHer first act on the morrow was to have an interview with her\r\nson-in-law's solicitor. Nothing could be more hopeless than Mr.\r\nGayland's representation of his client's affairs. The various deeds of\r\nsettlement and entail, through which he inherited his estate, were\r\nclogged in such a manner as to render an absolute sale of his\r\nreversionary prospects impossible, so that the raising of money on them\r\ncould only be effected at an immense future sacrifice. Under these\r\ncircumstances Gayland had been unwilling to proceed, and appeared\r\nlukewarm and dilatory, while he was impelled by that love for the\r\npreservation of property, which often finds place in the mind of a legal\r\nadviser.\r\n\r\nLady Lodore listened attentively to his statements. She asked the extent of\r\nEdward's debts, and somewhat started at the sum named as necessary to\r\nclear him. She then told Mr. Gayland that their ensuing conversation\r\nmust continue under a pledge of secrecy on his part. He assented, and\r\nshe proceeded to represent her intention of disposing of her jointure\r\nfor the purpose of extricating Villiers from his embarrassments. She\r\ngave directions for its sale, and instructions for obtaining the\r\nnecessary papers to effect it. Mr. Gayland's countenance brightened; yet\r\nhe offered a few words of remonstrance against such unexampled\r\ngenerosity.\r\n\r\n\"The sacrifice,\" said Lady Lodore, \"is not so great as you imagine. A\r\nvariety of circumstances tend to compensate me for it. I do not depend upon\r\nthis source of income alone; and be assured, that what I do, I consider, on\r\nthe whole, as benefiting me even more than Mr. Villiers.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gayland bowed; and Cornelia returned home with a light heart. For\r\nmonths she had not felt such an exhilaration of spirits. A warm joy\r\nthrilled through her frame, and involuntary smiles dimpled her cheeks.\r\nDusky and dingy as was the day, the sunshine of her soul dissipated its\r\nshadows, and spread brightness over her path. She could scarcely\r\ncontroul the expression of her delight; and when she sat down to write\r\nto Ethel, it was several minutes before she was able to collect her\r\nthoughts, so as to remember what she had intended to say. Two notes were\r\ndestroyed before she had succeeded in imparting that sobriety to her\r\nexpressions, which was needful to veil her purpose, which she had\r\nresolved to lock within her own breast for ever. At length she was\r\nobliged to satisfy herself with a few vague expressions. This was her\r\nletter:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I cannot help believing, my dearest girl, that your trials are coming\r\nto a conclusion. I have seen Mr. Gayland; and it appears to me that\r\nenergy and activity are chiefly wanting for the arrangement of your\r\nhusband's affairs: I think I have in some degree inspired these. He has\r\npromised to write to Mr. Villiers, who, I trust, will find satisfaction\r\nin his views. Do you, my dearest Ethel, keep up your spirits, and take\r\ncare of your precious health. We shall meet again in better days, when\r\nyou will be rewarded for your sufferings and goodness. Believe me, I\r\nlove as much as I admire you; so, in spite of the past, think of me with\r\nindulgence and affection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Lodore dressed to dine out, and for an evening assembly. She looked so\r\nradiant and so beautiful, that admiration and compliments were showered\r\nupon her. How vain and paltry they all seemed; and yet her feelings were\r\nwholly changed from that period, when she desired to reject and scoff at\r\nthe courtesy of her fellow-creatures. The bitterness of spirit was gone,\r\nwhich had prompted her to pour out gall and sarcasm, and had made it her\r\ngreatest pleasure to revel in the contempt and hate that filled her\r\nbosom towards herself and others. She was now at peace with the world,\r\nand disposed to view its follies charitably. Yet how immeasurably\r\nsuperior she felt herself to all those around her! not through vanity or\r\nsupercilious egotism, but from the natural spring of inward joy and\r\nself-approbation, which a consciousness of doing well opened in her\r\nbefore dried-up heart. She somewhat contemned her friends, and wholly\r\npitied them. But she could not dwell on any disagreeable sentiment. Her\r\nthoughts, while she reverted to the circumstances that so changed their\r\ntenor, were stained with the fairest hues, harmonized by the most\r\ndelicious music. She had risen to a sphere above, beyond the ordinary\r\nsoarings of mortals--a world without a cloud, without one ungenial\r\nbreath. She wondered at herself. She looked back with mingled horror and\r\nsurprise on the miserable state of despondence to which she had been\r\nreduced. Where were now her regrets?--where her ennui, her repinings,\r\nher despair? \"In the deep bosom of the ocean buried!\"--and she arose, as\r\nfrom a second birth, to new hopes, new prospects, new feelings; or\r\nrather to another state of being, which had no affinity to the former.\r\nFor poverty was now her pursuit, obscurity her desire, ruin her hope;\r\nand she smiled on, and beckoned to these, as if life possessed no\r\ngreater blessings.\r\n\r\nHer impetuosity and pride served to sustain the high tone of her soul.\r\nShe had none of that sloth of purpose, or weakness of feeling, that\r\nleads to hesitation and regret. To resolve with her had been, during the\r\nwhole course of her life, to do; and what her mind was set upon she\r\naccomplished--it might be rashly, but still with that independence and\r\nenergy, that gave dignity even to her more ambiguous actions. As before,\r\nwhen she cast off Lodore, she had never admitted a doubt that she was\r\njustified before God and her conscience for refusing to submit to the\r\nmost insulting tyranny; so now, believing that she had acted ill in not\r\ndemanding the guardianship of her daughter, and resolving to atone for\r\nthe evils which were the consequence of this neglect of duty on her\r\npart, she had no misgivings as to the future, but rushed precipitately\r\nonwards. As a racer at the Olympic games, she panted to arrive at the\r\ngoal, though it were only to expire at the moment of its attainment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Ethel had been enchanted by her mother's visit, and spoke of\r\nit to Villiers as a proof of the real goodness of her heart, insisting\r\nthat she was judged harshly and falsely. Villiers smiled incredulously.\r\n\"She gains your esteem at an easy rate,\" he observed; \"cultivate it, if\r\nit makes you happier. It will need more than a mere act of ordinary\r\ncourtesy--more than a slight invitation to her house, to persuade me\r\nthat Lady Lodore is not--what she is--a worshipper of the world, a\r\nfrivolous, unfeeling woman. Mark me whether she comes again.\"\r\n\r\nHer letter, on the following day, strengthened his opinion. \"This is\r\neven insulting,\" he said: \"she takes care to inform you that she will\r\nnot look again on your poverty, but will wait for _better days_ to bring\r\nyou together. The kindness of such an intimation is quite admirable. She\r\nhas inspired Gayland with energy and activity!--O, then, she must be a\r\nMedea, in more senses than the more obvious one.\"\r\n\r\nEthel looked reproachfully. She saw that Villiers was deeply hurt that\r\nLady Lodore had become acquainted with their distresses, and been a witness\r\nof the nakedness of the land. She could not inspire him with the tenderness\r\nthat warmed her heart towards her mother, and the conviction she\r\nentertained, in spite of appearances, (for she was forced to confess to\r\nherself that Lady Lodore's letter was not exactly the one she expected,)\r\nthat her heart was generous and affectionate. It was a comfort to her\r\nthat Fanny Derham participated in her opinions. Fanny was quite sure\r\nthat Lady Lodore would prove herself worthy of the esteem she had so\r\nsuddenly conceived for her; and Ethel listened delightedly to her\r\nassertions--it was so soothing to think well of, to love, and praise her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nThe solicitor's letter, which came, as Lady Lodore announced, somewhat\r\nsurprised Villiers; yet, after a little reflection, he gave no heed to\r\nits contents. It said, that upon further consideration of particular\r\npoints, Gayland perceived certain facilities; by improving upon which,\r\nhe hoped soon to make a favourable arrangement, and to extricate Mr.\r\nVilliers from his involvements. Any thing so vague demanded explanation.\r\nEdward wrote earnestly, requesting one; but his letter remained\r\nunanswered. Perplexed and annoyed, he obtained permission to quit his\r\nbounds for a few hours, and called upon the man of law. Gayland was so\r\nbusy, that he could not afford him more than five minutes' conversation.\r\nHe said that he had hopes--even expectations; that a little time would\r\nshow more; and he begged his client to be patient. Villiers returned in\r\ndespair. The only circumstance that at all served to inspire him with\r\nany hope, was, that on the day succeeding to his visit, he received a\r\nremittance of an hundred pounds from Gayland, who begged to be\r\nconsidered as his banker till the present negociations should be\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\nThere was some humiliation in the knowledge of how welcome this supply\r\nhad become, and Ethel used her gentle influence to mitigate the pain of\r\nsuch reflections. If she ever drooped, it was not for herself, but for\r\nVilliers; and she carefully hid even these disinterested repinings. Her\r\nown condition did not inspire her with any fears, and the anxiety that\r\nshe experienced for her unborn child was untinctured by bitterness or\r\ndespair. She felt assured that their present misfortunes would be of\r\nshort duration; and instead of letting her thoughts dwell on the\r\nmortifications or shame that marked the passing hour, she loved to fill\r\nher mind with pleasing sensations, inspired by the tenderness of her\r\nhusband, the kindness of poor Fanny, and the reliance she had in the\r\nreality of her mother's affection. In vain, she said, did the harsher\r\nelements of life try to disturb the serenity which the love of those\r\naround her produced in her soul. Her happiness was treasured in their\r\nhearts, and did not emanate from the furniture of a room, nor the\r\ncomfort of an equipage. Her babe, if destined to open its eyes first on\r\nsuch a scene, would be still less acted upon by its apparent\r\ncheerlessness. Cradled in her arms, and nourished at her bosom, what\r\nmore benign fate could await the little stranger? What was there in\r\ntheir destiny worthy of grief, while they remained true to each other?\r\n\r\nWith such arguments she tried to inspire Villiers with a portion of that\r\nfortitude and patience which was a natural growth in herself. They had\r\nbut slender effect upon him. Their different educations had made her\r\ngreatly his superior in these virtues; besides that she, with her\r\nsimpler habits and unprejudiced mind, was less shocked by the\r\nconcomitants of penury, than he, bred in high notions of aristocratic\r\nexclusiveness. She had spent her youth among settlers in a new country,\r\nand did not associate the idea of disgrace with want. Nakedness and\r\ngaunt hunger had often been the invaders of her forest home, scarcely to\r\nbe repelled by her father's forethought and resources. How could she\r\ndeem these shameful, when they had often assailed the most worthy and\r\nindustrious, who were not the less regarded or esteemed on that account.\r\nShe had acquired a practical philosophy, while inhabiting the western\r\nwilderness, and beholding the vast variety of life that it presents,\r\nwhich stood her in good stead under her European vicissitudes. The white\r\ninhabitants of America did not form her only school. The Red Indian and\r\nhis squaw were also human beings, subject to the same necessities,\r\nmoved, in the first instance, by the same impulses as herself. All that\r\nbore the human form were sanctified to her by the spirit of sympathy;\r\nand she could not, as Edward did, feel herself wholly outcast and under\r\nban, while kindness, however humble, and intelligence, however lowly,\r\nattended upon her.\r\n\r\nVilliers could not yield to her arguments, nor partake her wisdom; yet\r\nhe was glad that she possessed any source of consolation, however\r\nunimaginable by himself. He buried within his heart the haughty sense of\r\nwrong. He uttered no complaint, though his whole being rebelled against\r\nthe state of inaction to which he was reduced. It maddened him to feel\r\nthat he could not stir a finger to help himself, even while he fancied\r\nthat he saw his young wife withering before his eyes; and looked forward\r\nto the birth of his child, under circumstances, that rendered even the\r\nnecessary attendance difficult, if not impracticable. The heaviest\r\nweight of slavery fell upon him, for it was he that was imprisoned, and\r\nforbidden to go beyond certain limits; and though Ethel religiously\r\nconfined herself within yet narrower bounds than those allotted to him,\r\nhe only saw, in this delicacy, another source of evil. Nor were these\r\nreal tangible ills those which inflicted the greatest pain. Had these\r\nmisfortunes visited him in the American wilderness, or in any part of\r\nthe world where the majesty of nature had surrounded them, he fancied\r\nthat he should have been less alive to their sinister influence. But\r\nhere shame was conjoined with the perpetual spectacle of the least\r\nreputable class of the civilized community. Their walks were haunted by\r\nmen who bore the stamp of profligacy and crime; and the very shelter of\r\ntheir dwelling was shared by the mean and vulgar. His aristocratic pride\r\nwas sorely wounded at every turn;--not for himself so much, for he was\r\nmanly enough to feel \"that a man's a man for all that,\"--but for Ethel's\r\nsake, whom he would have fondly placed apart from all that is deformed\r\nand unseemly, guarded even from the rougher airs of heaven, and\r\nsurrounded by every thing most luxurious and beautiful in the world.\r\n\r\nThere was no help. Now and then he got a letter from his father, full of\r\nunmeaning apologies and unmanly complaints. The more irretrievable his\r\npoverty became, the firmer grew his resolve not to burden with his wants\r\nany more distant relation. He would readily give up every prospect of\r\nfuture wealth to purchase ease and comfort for Ethel; but he could not\r\nbend to any unworthy act; and the harder he felt pressed upon and\r\ninjured by fortune, the more jealously he maintained his independence of\r\nfeeling; on that he would lean to the last, though it proved a sword to\r\npierce him.\r\n\r\nHe looked forward with despair, yet he tried to conceal his worst\r\nthoughts, which would still be brooding upon absolute want and\r\nstarvation. He answered Ethel's cheering tones in accents of like cheer,\r\nand met the melting tenderness of her gaze with eyes that spoke of love\r\nonly. He endeavoured to persuade her that he did not wholly shut his\r\nheart from the hopes she was continually presenting to him. Hopes, the\r\nvery names of which were mockery. For they must necessarily be embodied\r\nin words and ideas--and his father or uncle were mentioned--the one had\r\nproved a curse, the other a temptation. He could trace his reverses as\r\nto the habits of expence and the false views of his resources, acquired\r\nunder Lord Maristow's tutelage, as to the prodigality and neglect of his\r\nparent. Even the name of Horatio Saville produced bitterness. Why was\r\nhe not here? He would not intrude his wants upon him in his Italian\r\nhome; but had he been in England, they had been saved from these worst\r\nblows of fate.\r\n\r\nThe only luxury of Villiers was to steal some few hours of solitude,\r\nwhen he could indulge in his miserable reflections without restraint.\r\nThe loveliness and love of Ethel were then before his imagination to\r\ndrive him to despair. To suffer alone would have been nothing; but to\r\nsee this child of beauty and tenderness, this fairest nursling of nature\r\nand liberty, droop and fade in their narrow, poverty-striken home, bred\r\nthoughts akin to madness. During each live-long night he was kept awake\r\nby the anguish of such reflections. Darker thoughts sometimes intruded\r\nthemselves. He fancied that if he were dead, Ethel would be happier. He\r\nmother, his relations, each and all would come forward to gift her with\r\nopulence and ease. The idea of self-destruction thus became soothing;\r\nand he pondered with a kind of savage pleasure on the means by which he\r\nshould end the coil of misery that had wound round him.\r\n\r\nAt such times the knowledge of Ethel's devoted affection checked him. Or\r\nsometimes, as he gazed on her as she lay sleeping at his side, he felt\r\nthat every sorrow was less than that which separation must produce; and\r\nthat to share adversity with her was greater happiness than the\r\nenjoyment of prosperity apart from her. Once, when brought back from the\r\ngloomiest desperation by such a return of softer emotions, the words of\r\nFrancesca da Rimini rushed upon his mind and completed the change. He\r\nrecollected how she and her lover were consoled by their eternal\r\ncompanionship in the midst of the infernal whirlwind. \"And do I love you\r\nless, my angel?\" he thought; \"are you not more dear to me than woman\r\never was to man, and would I divide myself from you because we suffer?\r\nPerish the thought! Whether for good or ill, let our existences still\r\ncontinue one, and from the sanctity and sympathy of our union, a sweet\r\nwill be extracted, sufficient to destroy the bitterness of this hour. We\r\nprefer remaining together, mine own sweet love, for ever together,\r\nthough it were for an eternity of pain. And these woes are finite. Your\r\npure and exalted nature will be rewarded for its sufferings, and I, for\r\nyour sake, shall be saved. I could not live without you in this world;\r\nand yet with insane purpose I would rush into the unknown, away from\r\nyou, leaving you to seek comfort and support from other hands than mine.\r\nI was base and cowardly to entertain the thought, but for one moment--a\r\ntraitor to my own affection, and the stabber of your peace. Ah, dearest\r\nEthel, when in a few hours your eyes will open on the light, and seek me\r\nas the object most beloved by them, were I away, unable to return their\r\nfondness, incapable of the blessing of beholding them, what hell could\r\nbe contrived to punish more severely my dereliction of duty?\"\r\n\r\nWith this last thought another train of feeling was introduced, and he\r\nstrung himself to more manly endurance. He saw that his post was\r\nassigned him in this world, and that he ought to fulfil its duties with\r\ncourage and patience. Hope came hand in hand with such ideas--and the\r\ndawn of content on his soul was a proof that the exercise of virtue\r\nbrought with it its own reward. He could not always keep his feelings in\r\nthe same tone, but he no longer saw greatness of mind in the indulgence\r\nof sorrow.\r\n\r\nHe remembered that throughout the various stations into which society\r\nhas divided human beings, adversity and pain belong to each, and that\r\ndeath and treachery are more frightful evils than all the hardships of\r\nlife. He thought of his unborn child, and of his duties towards it--not\r\nonly in a worldly point of view, but as its teacher and guide in morals\r\nand religion. The beauty and use of the ties of blood, to which his\r\npeculiar situation had hitherto blinded him, became intelligible at once\r\nto his heart and his understanding; and while he felt how ill his father\r\nhad fulfilled the paternal duties, he resolved that his own offspring\r\nshould never have cause to reproach him for similar misconduct. Before\r\nhe had repined because the evils of his lot seemed gratuitous suffering;\r\nbut now he felt, as Ethel had often expressed it, that the sting of\r\nhumiliation is taken from misfortune, when we nerve ourselves to endure\r\nit for another's sake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world had just begun to steal\r\nEach hope that led me lightly on,\r\nI felt not as I used to feel,\r\nAnd life grew dark and love was gone.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the young pair were thus struggling with the severe visitation of\r\nadversity, Lady was earnestly engaged in her endeavours to extricate\r\nthem from their difficulties. The ardour of her zeal had made her take\r\nthe first steps in this undertaking, with a resolution that would not\r\nlook behind, and a courage not to be dismayed by the dreary prospect\r\nwhich the future afforded. The scheme which she had planned, and was now\r\nproceeding to execute, was unbounded in generosity and self-sacrifice.\r\nIt was not in her nature to stop short at half-measures, nor to pause\r\nwhen once she had fixed her purpose. If she ever trembled on looking\r\nforward to the utter ruin she was about to encounter, her second emotion\r\nwas to despise herself for such pusillanimity, and to be roused to\r\nrenewed energy. She intended to devote as much as was necessary of the\r\nmoney arising from the sale of her jointure, as fixed by her marriage\r\nsettlement, for the liquidation of her son-in-law's debts. The remaining\r\nsix hundred a-year, bequeathed to her in Lord Lodore's will, under\r\ncircumstances of cruel insult, she resolved to give up to her daughter's\r\nuse, for her future subsistence. She hoped to save enough from the sum\r\nproduced by the disposal of her jointure, to procure the necessaries of\r\nlife for a few years, and she did not look beyond. She would quit London\r\nfor ever. She must leave her house, which she had bought during her days\r\nof prosperity, and which she had felt so much pride and delight in\r\nadorning with every luxury and comfort: to crown her good work, she\r\nintended to give it up to Ethel. And then with her scant means she would\r\ntake refuge in the solitude where Lodore found her, and spend the\r\nresidue of her days among the uncouth and lonely mountains of Wales, in\r\npoverty and seclusion. It was from no agreeable association with her\r\nearly youth, that she selected the neighbourhood of Rhaider Gowy for her\r\nfuture residence; nor from a desire of renewing the recollections of the\r\nperiod spent there, nor of revisiting the scenes, where she had stepped\r\nbeyond infancy into the paths of life. Her choice simply arose from\r\nbeing obliged to think of economy in its strictest sense, and she\r\nremembered this place as the cheapest in the world, and the most\r\nretired. Besides, that in fixing on a part of the country which she had\r\nbefore inhabited, and yet where she would be utterly unknown, the idea\r\nof her future home assumed distinctness, and a greater sense of\r\npracticability was imparted to her schemes, than could have been the\r\ncase, had she been unable to form any image in her mind of the exact\r\nspot whither she was about to betake herself.\r\n\r\nThe first conception of this plan had dawned on her soul, as the design\r\nof some sublime poem or magnificent work of art may present itself to\r\nthe contemplation of the poet and man of genius. She dwelt on it in its\r\nentire result, with a glow of joy; she entered into its details with\r\nchildish eagerness. She pictured to herself the satisfaction of Villiers\r\nand Ethel at finding themselves suddenly, as by magic, restored to\r\nfreedom and the pleasures of life. She figured their gladness in\r\nexchanging their miserable lodging for the luxury of her elegant\r\ndwelling; their pleasure in forgetting the long train of previous\r\nmisfortunes, or remembering them only to enhance their prosperity, when\r\npain and fear, disgrace and shame, should be exchanged for security and\r\ncomfort. She repeated to herself, \"I do all this--I, the despised\r\nCornelia! I who was deemed unworthy to have the guardianship of my own\r\nchild. I, who was sentenced to desertion and misery, because I was too\r\nworldly and selfish to be worthy of Horace Saville! How little through\r\nlife has my genuine character been known, or its qualities appreciated!\r\nNor will it be better understood now. My sacrifices will continue a\r\nmystery, and even the benefits I am forced to acknowledge to flow from\r\nme, I shall diminish in their eyes, by bestowing them with apparent\r\nindifference. Will they ever deign to discover the reality under the\r\ndeceitful appearances which it will be my pride to exhibit? I care not;\r\nconscience will approve me--and when I am alone and unthought of, the\r\nknowledge that Ethel is happy through my means will make poverty a\r\nblessing.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not pride alone that induced Lady Lodore to resolve on concealing\r\nthe extent of her benefits. All that she could give was not much if\r\ncompared with the fortunes of the wealthy--but it was a competence, which\r\nwould enable her daughter and her husband to expect better days with\r\npatience; but if they knew how greatly she was a sufferer for their good,\r\nthey would insist at least upon her sharing their income--and what was\r\nscanty in its entireness, would be wholly insufficient when divided.\r\nVilliers also might dispute or reject her kindness, and deeply injured as\r\nshe believed herself to have been by him--injured by his disesteem, and the\r\ninfluence he had used over Saville, in a manner so baneful to her\r\nhappiness, she felt irrepressible exultation at the idea of heaping\r\nobligation on him,--and knowing herself to be deserving of his deepest\r\ngratitude. All these sentiments might be deemed fantastic, or at least\r\nextravagant. Yet her conclusions were reasonable, for it was perfectly\r\ntrue that Villiers would rather have returned to his prison, than have\r\npurchased freedom at the vast price she was about to pay for it. No, her\r\ndesign was faultless in its completeness, meagre and profitless if she\r\nstopt short of its full execution. Nor would she see Ethel again in the\r\ninterim--partly fearful of not preserving her secret inviolate--partly\r\nbecause she felt so strongly drawn towards her, that she dreaded finding\r\nherself the slave of an affection--a passion, which, under her\r\ncircumstances, she could not indulge. Without counsellor, without one\r\nfriendly voice to encourage, she advanced in the path she had marked\r\nout, and drew from her own heart only the courage to proceed.\r\n\r\nIt required, however, all her force of character to carry her forward. A\r\nthousand difficulties were born at every minute, and the demands made\r\nwere increased to such an extent as to make it possible that they would\r\ngo beyond her means of satisfying them. She had not the assistance of\r\none friend acquainted with the real state of things to direct her--her\r\nonly adviser was a man of law, who did what he was directed--not indeed\r\nwith passive obedience, but whose deviations from mere acquiescence,\r\narose from technical objections and legal difficulties, at once\r\nunintelligible and tormenting.\r\n\r\nBesides these more palpable annoyances, other clouds arose, natural to\r\nwavering humanity, which would sometimes shadow Cornelia's soul, so that\r\nshe drooped from he height she had reached, with a timid and dejected\r\nspirit. At first she looked forward to ruin, exile, and privation, as to\r\npossessions which she coveted--but the further she proceeded, the more\r\nshe lost view of the light and gladness which had attended on the dawn\r\nof her new visions. Futurity became enveloped in an appalling obscurity,\r\nwhile the present was sad and cheerless. The ties which she had formed\r\nin the world, which she had fancied it would be so easy to cut asunder,\r\nassumed strength; and she felt that she must endure many pangs in the\r\nact of renouncing them for ever. The scenes and persons which, a little\r\nwhile ago, she had regarded as uninteresting and frivolous--she was now\r\nforced to acknowledge to be too inextricably interwoven with her habits\r\nand pursuits, to be all at once quitted without severe pain. When the\r\nfuture was spoken of by others with joyous anticipation, her heart sunk\r\nwithin her, to think how her hereafter was to become disjointed and cast\r\naway from all that had preceded it. The mere pleasures of society grew\r\ninto delights, when thought of as about to become unattainable; and\r\nslight partialities were regarded as if founded upon strong friendship\r\nand tender affection. She was not aware till now how habit and\r\nassociation will endear the otherwise indifferent, and how the human\r\nheart, prone to love, will entwine its ever-sprouting tendrils around\r\nany object, not absolutely repulsive, which is brought into near contact\r\nwith it. When any of her favourites addressed her in cordial tones, when\r\nshe met the glance of one she esteemed, directed towards her with an\r\nexpression of kindliness and sympathy, her eyes grew dim, and a thrill\r\nof anguish passed through her frame. All that she had a little while ago\r\nscorned as false and empty, she now looked upon as the pleasant reality\r\nof life, which she was to exchange for she scarcely knew what--a living\r\ngrave, a friendless desart--for silence and despair.\r\n\r\nIt is a hard trial at all times to begin the world anew, even when we\r\nexchange a mediocre station for one which our imagination paints as full\r\nof enjoyment and distinction. How much more difficult it was for Lady to\r\ndespoil herself of every good, and voluntarily to encounter poverty in\r\nits most unadorned guise. As time advanced, she became fully aware of\r\nwhat she would have to go through, and her heroism was the greater,\r\nbecause, though the charm had vanished, and no hope of compensation or\r\nreward was held out, she did not shrink from accomplishing her task. She\r\ncould not exactly say, like old Adam in the play,\r\n\r\n\r\nAt seventeen years many their fortunes seek,\r\nBut at fourscore it is too late a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet at her age it was perhaps more difficult to cast off the goods of this\r\nworld, than at a more advanced one. Midway in life, we are not weaned\r\nfrom affections and pleasures--we still hope. We even demand more of\r\nsolid advantages, because the romantic ideas of youth have disappeared,\r\nand yet we are not content to give up the game. We no longer set our\r\nhearts on ephemeral joys, but require to be enabled to put our trust in\r\nthe continuance of any good offered to our choice. This desire of\r\ndurability in our pleasures is equally felt by the young; but ardour of\r\nfeeling and ductility of imagination is then at hand to bestow a\r\nquality, so dear and so unattainable to fragile humanity, on any object\r\nwe desire should be so gifted. But at a riper age we pause, and seek\r\nthat our reason may be convinced, and frequently prefer a state of\r\nprosperity less extatic and elevated, because its very sobriety\r\nsatisfies us that it will not slip suddenly from our grasp.\r\n\r\nThe comforts of life, the esteem of friends--these are things which we\r\nthen regard with the greatest satisfaction; and other feelings, less\r\nreasonable, yet not less keenly felt, may enter into the circle of\r\nsensations, which forms the existence of a beautiful woman. It is less\r\neasy for one who has been all her life admired and waited upon, to give\r\nup the few last years of such power, than it would have been to cast\r\naway the gift in earlier life. She has learned to doubt her influence,\r\nto know its value, and to prize it. In girlhood it may be matter of mere\r\ntriumph--in after years it will be looked on as an inestimable quality\r\nby which she may more easily and firmly secure the benevolence of her\r\nfellow-creatures. All this depends upon the polish of the skin and the\r\nfire of the eye, which a few years will deface and quench--and while the\r\nopprobrious epithet of old woman approaches within view, she is glad to\r\nfeel secure from its being applied to her, by perceiving the signs of\r\nthe influence of her surviving attractions marked in the countenances of\r\nher admirers. Lady never felt so kindly inclined towards hers, as now\r\nthat she was about to withdraw from them. Their admiration, for its own\r\nsake, she might contemn, but she valued it as the testimony that those\r\ncharms were still hers, which once had subdued the soul of him she\r\nloved--and this was no disagreeable assurance to one who was on the eve\r\nof becoming a grandmother.\r\n\r\nHer sensibility, awakened by the considerations forced on her by her new\r\ncircumstances, caused her to make more progress in the knowledge of\r\nlife, and in the philosophy of its laws, than love or ambition had ever\r\ndone before. The last had rendered her proud from success, the first had\r\ncaused her to feel dependent on one only; but now that she was about to\r\nabandon all, she found herself bound to all by stronger ties than she\r\ncould have imagined. She became aware that any new connexion could never\r\nbe adorned by the endearing recollections attending those she had\r\nalready formed. The friends of her youth, her mere acquaintances, she\r\nregarded with peculiar partiality, as being the witnesses or sharers of\r\nher past joys and successes. Each familiar face was sanctified in her\r\neyes by association; and she walked among those whom she had so lately\r\nscorned, as if they were saintly memorials to be approached with awe,\r\nand quitted with eternal regret. Her hopes and prospects had hinged upon\r\nthem, but her life became out of joint when she quitted them. Her\r\nsensitive nature melted in unwonted tenderness while occupied by such\r\ncontemplations, and they turned the path, she had so lately entered as\r\none of triumph and gladness, to gloom and despondence.\r\n\r\nSometimes she pondered upon means for preserving her connexion with the\r\nworld. But any scheme of that kind was fraught, on the one hand, with\r\nmortification to herself, on the other, with the overthrow of her\r\ndesigns, through the repugnance which Ethel and her husband would feel\r\nat occasioning such unmeasured sacrifices. She often regretted that\r\nthere were no convents, to which she might retire with safety and\r\ndignity. Conduct, such as she contemplated pursuing, would, under the\r\nold regime in France, have been recompensed by praise and gratitude;\r\nwhile its irrevocability must prevent any resistance to her wishes. In\r\ngiving up fortune and station, she would have placed herself under the\r\nguardianship of a community; and have found protection and security, to\r\ncompensate for poverty and slavery. The very reverse of all this must\r\nnow happen. Alone, friendless, unknown, and therefore despised, she must\r\nshift for herself, and rely on her own resources for prudence to insure\r\nsafety, and courage to endure the evils of her lot. To one of another\r\nsex, the name of loneliness can never convey the idea of desolation and\r\ndisregard, which gives it so painful a meaning in a woman's mind. They\r\nhave not been taught always to look up to others, and to do nothing for\r\nthemselves; so that business becomes a matter of heroism to a woman,\r\nwhen conducted in the most common-place way; but when it is accompanied\r\nby mystery, she feels herself transported from her fitting place, and as\r\nif about to encounter shame and contumely. Lady Lodore had never been\r\nconversant with any mode of life, except that of being waited on and\r\nwatched over. In the poverty of her early girlhood, her mother had been\r\nconstantly at her side. The necessity of so conducting herself as to\r\nprevent the shadow of slander from visiting her, had continued this\r\nstate of dependence during all her married life. She had never stept\r\nacross a street without attendance; nor put on her gloves, but as\r\nbrought to her by a servant. Her look had commanded obedience, and her\r\nwill had been law with those about her. This was now to be altered. She\r\nscarcely reverted in her mind to these minuti\u00e6; and when she did, it\r\nwas to smile at herself for being able to give weight to such trifles.\r\nShe was not aware how, hereafter, these small things would become the\r\nshapings and embodyings which desertion and penury would adopt, to sting\r\nher most severely. The new course she was about to enter, was too\r\nunknown to make her fears distinct. There was one vast blank before her,\r\none gigantic and mishapen image of desertion, which filled her mind to\r\nthe exclusion of every other, but whose parts were not made out, though\r\nthis very indistinctness was the thing that often chiefly appalled her.\r\n\r\nShe said, with the noble exile,[2]--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,\r\nToo far in years to be a pupil now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is true that she had not, like him,\r\nto lament that--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My native English, now I must forego;\"\r\n\r\n\r\nbut there is\r\nanother language, even more natural than the mere dialect in which we\r\nhave been educated. When our lips no longer utter the sentiments of our\r\nheart--when we are forced to exchange the spontaneous effusions of the\r\nsoul for cramped and guarded phrases, which give no indication of the\r\nthought within,--then, indeed, may we say, that our tongue becomes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . \"an unstringed viol, or a harp,\r\n. . . . . . put into his hands,\r\nThat knows no touch to tune the harmony.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this was to be Lady Lodore's position. Her only companions would be\r\nvillagers; or, at best, a few Welsh gentry, with whom she could have no\r\nreal communication. Sympathy, the charm of life, was dead for her, and\r\nher state of banishment would be far more complete than if mountains and\r\nseas only constituted its barriers.\r\n\r\nLady Lodore was often disturbed by these reflections, but she did not on\r\nthat account waver in her purpose. The flesh might shrink, but the spirit\r\nwas firm. Sometimes, indeed, she wondered how it was that she had first\r\nconceived the design, which had become the tyrant of her life. She had\r\nlong known that she had a daughter, young, lovely, and interesting,\r\nwithout any great desire to become intimate with her. Sometimes pride,\r\nsometimes indignation, had checked her maternal feelings. The only time\r\nbefore, in which she had felt any emotion similar to that which now\r\ngoverned her, was on the day when she had spoken to her in the House of\r\nLords. But instead of indulging it, she had fled from it as an enemy,\r\nand despised herself as a dupe, for being for one instant its subject.\r\nWhen her fingers then touched her daughter's cheek, she had not trembled\r\nlike Ethel; yet an awful sensation passed through her frame, which for a\r\nmoment stunned her, and she hastily retreated, to recover herself. Now,\r\non the contrary, she longed to strain her child to her heart; she\r\nthought no sacrifice too great, which was to conduce to her advantage;\r\nand that she condemned herself never to see her more, appeared the\r\nhardest part of the lot she was to undergo. Why was this change? She\r\ncould not tell--memory could not inform her. She only knew that since\r\nshe had seen Ethel in her adversity, the stoniness of her heart had\r\ndissolved within her, that her whole being was subdued to tenderness,\r\nand that the world was changed from what it had been in her eyes. She\r\nfelt that she could not endure life, unless for the sake of benefiting\r\nher child; and that this sentiment mastered her in spite of herself, so\r\nthat every struggle with it was utterly vain.\r\n\r\nThus if she sometimes repined at the hard fate that drove her into\r\nexile, yet she never wavered in her intentions; and in the midst of\r\nregret, a kind of exultation was born, which calmed her pain. Smiles sat\r\nupon her features, and her voice was attuned to cheerfulness. The\r\nnew-sprung tenderness of her soul imparted a fascination to her manner\r\nfar more irresistible than that to which tact and polish had given rise.\r\nShe was more kind and affectionate, and, above all, more sincere, and\r\ntherefore more winning. Every one felt, though none could divine the\r\ncause of, this change. It was remarked that she was improved: some\r\nshrewdly suspected that she was in love. And so she was--with an object\r\nmore enchanting than any earthly lover. For the first time she knew and\r\nloved the Spirit of good and beauty, an affinity to which affords the\r\ngreatest bliss that our nature can receive.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Richard II.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the same, for be it joy or sorrow.\r\nThe path of its departure still is free;\r\nMan's yesterday can ne'er be like his morrow,\r\nNor aught endure save mutability.\r\n\r\nSHELLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe month of June had commenced. In spite of lawyer's delays and the\r\ndifficulties attendant on all such negociations, they were at last\r\nconcluded, and nothing remained but for Lady to sign the paper which was\r\nto consign her to comparative destitution. In all changes we feel most\r\nkeenly the operation of small circumstances, and are chiefly depressed\r\nby the necessity of stooping to the direction of petty arrangements, and\r\nhaving to deal with subordinate persons. To complete her design, Lady\r\nLodore had to make many arrangements, trivial yet imperative, which\r\ncalled for her attention, when she was least fitted to give it. She had\r\nmet these demands on her patience without shrinking; and all was\r\nprepared for the finishing stroke about to be put to her plans. She\r\ndismissed those servants whom she did not intend to leave in the house\r\nfor Ethel's use. She contrived to hasten the intended marriage of her\r\nown maid, so to disburthen herself wholly. The mode by which she was,\r\nsolitary and unknown, to reach the mountains of Wales, without creating\r\nsuspicion, or leaving room for conjecture, was no easy matter. In human\r\nlife, one act is born of another, so that any one that disjoins itself\r\nfrom the rest, instantly gives rise to curiosity and inquiry. Lady\r\nLodore, though fertile in expedients, was almost foiled: the eligibility\r\nof having one confidant pressed itself upon her. She thought of Fanny\r\nDerham; but her extreme youth, and her intimacy with Mrs. Villiers,\r\nwhich would have necessitated many falsehoods, so to preserve the\r\nsecret, deterred her: she determined at last to trust to herself alone.\r\nShe resolved to take with her one servant only, who had not been long in\r\nher service, and to dismiss him immediately after leaving London.\r\nDifficulties presented themselves on every side; but she believed that\r\nthey could be best surmounted by obviating them in succession as they\r\narose, and that any fixed artificial plan would only tend to embarrass,\r\nwhile a simple mode of proceeding would continue unquestioned.\r\n\r\nHer chief art consisted in not appearing to be making any change at all.\r\nShe talked of a visit of two or three months to Emms, and mentioned her\r\nintention of lending her house, during the interval, to her daughter.\r\nShe thus secured to herself a certain period during which no curiosity\r\nwould be exicited; and after a month or two had passed away, she would\r\nbe utterly forgotten:--thus she reasoned; and whether it were a real\r\ntomb that she entered, or the living grave which she anticipated, her\r\nname and memory would equally vanish from the earth, and she be thought\r\nof no more. If Ethel ever entertained a wish to see her, Villiers would\r\nbe at hand to check and divert it. Who else was there to spend a thought\r\nupon her? Alone upon earth, no friendly eye, solicitous for her welfare,\r\nwould seek to penetrate the mystery in which she was about to envelope\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThe day came, it was the second of June, when every preliminary was\r\naccomplished. She had signed away all that she possessed--she had done\r\nit with a smile--and her voice was unfaltering. The sum which she had\r\nsaved for herself consisted of but a few hundred pounds, on which she\r\nwas to subsist for the future. Again she enforced his pledge of secrecy\r\non Mr. Gayland; and glad that all was over, yet heavy at heart in spite\r\nof her gladness, she returned to her home, which in a few hours she was\r\nto quit for ever.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time, her thoughts had seldom reverted to Saville. Hope\r\nwas dead, and the regrets of love had vanished with it. That he would\r\napprove her conduct, was an idea that now and then flashed across her\r\nmind; but he would remain in eternal ignorance, and therefore it could\r\nnot bring their thoughts into any communion. Whether he came to England,\r\nor remained at Naples, availed her nothing. No circumstance could add\r\nto, or diminish, the insuperable barrier which his marriage placed\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nShe returned home from her last interview with Mr. Gayland: it was four\r\no'clock in the day; at six she had appointed Fanny Derham to call on\r\nher; and an hour afterwards, the horses were ordered to be at the door,\r\nwhich were to convey her away.\r\n\r\nShe became strangely agitated. She took herself to task for her\r\nweakness; but every moment disturbed yet more the calm she was so\r\nanxious to attain. She walked through the rooms of the house she had\r\ndwelt in for so many years. She looked on the scene presented from her\r\nwindows. The drive in Hyde Park was beginning to fill with carriages and\r\nequestrians, to be thronged with her friends whom she was never again to\r\nsee. Deep sadness crept over her mind. Her uncontrollable thoughts, by\r\nsome association of ideas, which she could not disentangle--brought\r\nbefore her the image of Lodore, with more vividness than it had possessed\r\nfor years. A kind of wish to cross the Atlantic, and to visit the scenes\r\nwhere he had dwelt so long, arose within her; and then again she felt a\r\ndesire to visit Longfield, and to view the spot in which his mortal\r\nremains were laid. As her imagination pictured the grave of the husband\r\nof her youth, whom she had abandoned and forgotten, tears streamed from\r\nher eyes--the first she had shed, even in idea, beside it. \"It is not to\r\natone--for surely I was not guilty towards him\"--such were Lady Lodore's\r\nreflections,--\"yet, methinks, in this crisis of my fate, when about to\r\nimitate his abrupt and miserable act of self-banishment, my heart yearns\r\nfor some communication with him; and it seems to me as if, approaching\r\nhis cold, silent dust, he would hear me if I said, 'Be at peace! your\r\nchild is happy through my means!\"'\r\n\r\nAgain her reveries were attended by a gush of tears. \"How strange a fate\r\nis mine, ever to be abandoned by, or to abandon, those towards whom I am\r\nnaturally drawn into near contact. Fifteen years are flown since I\r\nparted from for ever! Then by inspiring one so high-minded, so richly\r\ngifted, as Saville, with love for me, fortune appeared ready to\r\ncompensate for my previous sufferings; but the curse again operated, and\r\nI shall never see him more. Yet do I not forget thee, Saville, nor thy\r\nlove!--nor can it be a crime to think of the past, which is as\r\nirretrievable as if the grave had closed over it. Through Saville it has\r\nbeen that I have not lived quite in vain--that I have known what love\r\nis; and might have even tasted of happiness, but for the poison which\r\nperpetually mingles with my cup. I never wish to see him more; but if I\r\nearnestly desire to visit Lodore's grave, how gladly would I make a far\r\nlonger pilgrimage to see Saville's child, and to devote myself to one\r\nwho owes its existence to him. Wretched Cornelia! what thoughts are\r\nthese? Is it now, that you are a beggar and an outcast, that you first\r\nencourage unattainable desires?\"\r\n\r\nStill as she looked round, and remembered how often Saville had been\r\nbeside her in that room, thoughts and regrets thronged faster and more\r\nthickly on her. She recollected the haughty self-will and capricious\r\ncoquetry which had caused the destruction of her dearest hopes. She took\r\ndown a miniature of herself, which her lover had so fruitlessly besought\r\nher to give him. It was on the belief that she had bestowed this picture\r\non a rival that he had so suddenly come to the determination of quitting\r\nEngland. It seemed now in its smiles and youth to reproach her for\r\nhaving wasted both; and the sight of it agitated her bosom, and produced\r\na tumult of regret and despair at his loss--till she threw it from her,\r\nas too dearly associated with one she must forget. And yet wherefore\r\nforget?--he had forgotten; but as a dead wife might in her grave, love\r\nher husband, though wedded to another, so might the lost, buried\r\nCornelia remember him, though the husband of Clorinda. Self-compassion\r\nnow moved her to tears, and she wept plentiful showers, which rather\r\nexhausted than relieved her.\r\n\r\nWith a strong effort she recalled her sense of what was actually going\r\non, and struggling resolutely to calm herself, she sat down and began a\r\nletter to her daughter, which was necessary, as some sort of\r\nexplanation, at once to allay wonder and baffle curiosity. Thus she\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"DEAREST ETHEL,\r\n\r\n\"My hopes have not been deceived. Mr. Gayland has at last contrived\r\nmeans for the liberation of your husband; and to-morrow morning you will\r\nleave that shocking place. Perhaps I receive more pleasure from this\r\npiece of good fortune than you, for your sense of duty and sweet\r\ndisposition so gild the vilest objects, that you live in a world of your\r\nown, as beautiful as yourself, and the accident of situation is\r\nimmaterial to you.\r\n\r\n\"It is not enough, however, that you should be free. I hope that the\r\npunctilious delicacy of Mr. Villiers will not cause you to reject the\r\nbenefits of a mother. In this instance there is more of justice than\r\ngenerosity in my offer; and it may therefore be accepted without the\r\nsmallest hesitation. My jointure ought to satisfy me, and the additional\r\nsix hundred a year--which I may call the price of blood, since I bought\r\nit at the sacrifice of the dearest ties and duties,--is most freely at\r\nyour service. It will delight me to get rid of it, as much as if thus I\r\nthrew off the consciousness of a crime. It is yours by every law of\r\nequity, and will be hereafter paid into your banker's hands. Do not\r\nthank me, my dear child--be happy, that will be my best reward. Be\r\nhappy, be prudent--this sum will not make you rich; and the only\r\nacknowledgment I ask of you is, that you make it suffice, and avoid debt\r\nand embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"By singular coincidence I am imperatively obliged to leave England at\r\nthis moment. The horses are ordered to be here in half an hour--I am\r\nobliged therefore to forego the pleasure of seeing you until my return.\r\nWill you forgive me this apparent neglect, which is the result of\r\nnecessity, and favour me by coming to my house to-morrow, on leaving\r\nyour present abode, and making it your home until my return? Miss Derham\r\nhas promised to call here this afternoon; I shall see her before I go,\r\nand through her you will learn how much you will make me your debtor by\r\naccepting my offers, and permitting me to be of some slight use to you.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse the brevity and insufficiency of this letter, written at the\r\nmoment of departure.--You will hear from me again, when I am able to\r\nsend you my address, and I shall hope to have a letter from you.\r\nMeanwhile Heaven bless you, my angelic Ethel! Love your mother, and\r\nnever, in spite of every thing, permit unkind thoughts of her to harbour\r\nin your mind. Make Mr. Villiers think as well of me as he can, and\r\nbelieve me that your welfare will always be the dearest wish of my\r\nheart. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\"Ever affectionately yours.\r\n\r\n\"C. LODORE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShe folded and sealed this letter, and at the same moment there was a\r\nknock at the door of her house, which she knew announced the arrival of\r\nFanny Derham. She was still much agitated, and trying to calm herself,\r\nshe took up a newspaper, and cast her eyes down the columns; so, by one\r\nof the most common place of the actions of our life, to surmount the\r\npainful intensity of her thoughts. She read mechanically one or two\r\nparagraphs--she saw the announcements of births, marriages, and deaths.\r\n\"My moral death will not be recorded here,\" she thought, \"and yet, I\r\nshall be more dead than any of these.\" The thought in her mind remained\r\nas it were truncated; her eye was arrested--a paleness came over\r\nher--the pulses of her heart paused, and then beat tumultuously--how\r\nstrange--how fatal were the words she read!--\r\n\r\n\"Died suddenly at the inn at the Mola di Gaeta, on her way from Naples,\r\nClorinda, the wife of the honourable Horatio Saville, in the\r\ntwenty-second year of her age.\"\r\n\r\nHer drawing-room door was opened, the butler announced Miss Derham,\r\nwhile her eyes still were fixed on the paragraph: her head swam\r\nround--the world seemed to slide from under her. Fanny's calm clear\r\nvoice recalled her. She conquered her agitation--she spoke as if she had\r\nnot just crossed a gulf--not been transported to a new world; and,\r\nagain, swifter than light, brought back to the old one. She conversed\r\nwith Fanny for some time; giving some kind of explanation for not having\r\nbeen to see Ethel, begging her young friend to press her invitation, and\r\nspeaking as if in autumn they should all meet again. Fanny, philosophic as\r\nshe was, regarded Lady Lodore with a kind of idolatry. The same charm that\r\nhad fascinated the unworldly and abstracted Saville, she exercised over\r\nthe thoughtful and ingenuous mind of the fair young student. It was the\r\nattraction of engaging manners, added now to the sense of right, joined\r\nto the timid softness of a woman, who trembled on acting unsupported,\r\neven though her conscience approved her deeds. It was her loveliness\r\nwhich had gained in expression what it had lost in youth, and kindness\r\nof heart was the soul of the enchantment. Fanny ventured to remonstrate\r\nagainst her sudden departure. \"O we shall soon meet again,\" said\r\nCornelia; but her thoughts were more of heaven than earth, as the scene\r\nof meeting; for her heart was chilled--her head throbbed--the words she\r\nhad read operated a revolution in her frame, more allied to sickness and\r\ndeath, than hope or triumph.\r\n\r\nFanny at length took her leave, and Lady Lodore was again alone. She took\r\nup the newspaper--hastily she read again the tidings; she sunk on the sofa,\r\nburying her face in the pillow, trying not to think, while she was\r\nindeed the prey to the wildest thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" thus ran her reflections, \"he is free--he is no longer _married_!\r\nFool, fool! he is still lost to you!--an outcast and a beggar, shall I\r\nsolicit his love! which he believes that I rejected when prosperous.\r\nRather never, never, let me see him again. My beauty is tarnished, my\r\nyouth flown; he would only see me to wonder how he had ever loved me.\r\nBetter hide beneath the mountains among which I am soon to find a\r\nhome--better, far better, die, than see Saville and read no love in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"Yet thus again I cast happiness from me. What then would I do? Unweave\r\nthe web--implore Mr. Villiers to endure my presence--reveal my state of\r\nbeggary--ask thanks for my generosity, and humbly wait for a kind glance\r\nfrom Saville, to raise me to wealth as well as to happiness.--Cornelia,\r\nawake!--be not subdued at the last-act not against your disposition, the\r\npride of your soul--the determinations you have formed--do not learn to\r\nbe humble in adversity--you, who were disdainful in happier days--no! if\r\nthey need me--if they love me--if Saville still remembers the\r\nworship--the heart's entire sacrifice which once he made to me--will a\r\nfew miles-the obscurity of my abode--or the silence and mystery that\r\nsurrounds me, check his endeavours that we should once again meet?\r\n\r\n\"No!\" she said, rising, \"my destiny is in other and higher hands than my\r\nown. It were vain to endeavour to controul it. Whatever I do, works\r\nagainst me; now let the thread be spun to the end, while I do nothing; I\r\ncan but endure the worst patiently; and how much better to bear in\r\nsilence, than to struggle vainly with the irrevocable decree! I submit.\r\nLet Providence work out its own ends, and God dispose of the being he\r\nhas made--whether I reap the harvest in this world or in the next, my\r\npart is played, I will strive no more!\"\r\n\r\nShe believed in her own singleness of purpose as she said this, and yet\r\nshe was never more deceived. While she boasted of her resignation, she\r\nwas yielding not to a high moral power, but to the pride of her soul.\r\nHer resolutions were in accordance with the haughtiness of her\r\ndisposition, and she felt satisfied, not because she was making a noble\r\nsacrifice, but because she thus adorned more magnificently the idol she\r\nset up for worship, and believed herself to be more worthy of applause\r\nand love. Yet who could condemn even errors that led to such unbending\r\nand heroic forgetfulness of all the baser propensities of our nature.\r\nNor was this feeling of triumph long-lived; the wounding and humiliating\r\nrealities of life, soon degraded her from her pedestal, and made her\r\nfeel, as it were, the disgrace and indignities of abdication.\r\n\r\nHer travelling chariot drove up to the door, and, after a few moments'\r\npreparation, she was summoned. Again she looked round the room; her\r\nheart swelled high with impatience and repining, but again she conquered\r\nherself. She took up her miniature--_that_ now she might possess--for she\r\ncould remember without sin--she took up the newspaper, which did or did\r\nnot contain the fiat of her fate; but this action appeared to militate\r\nagainst the state of resignation she had resolved to attain, so she\r\nthrew it down: she walked down the stairs, and passed out from her house\r\nfor the last time--she got into the carriage--the door was closed--the\r\nhorses were in motion-all was over.\r\n\r\nHer head felt sick and heavy; she leaned back in her carriage half\r\nstupified. When at last London and its suburbs were passed, the sight of\r\nthe open country a little revived her--but she soon drooped again.\r\nNothing presented itself to her thoughts with any clearness, and the\r\nexultation which had supported her vanished totally. She only knew that\r\nshe was alone, poor, forgotten; these words hovered on her lips, mingled\r\nwith others, by which she endeavoured to charm away her despondency.\r\nFortitude and resignation for herself--freedom and happiness for Ethel.\r\n\"O yes, she is free and happy--it matters not then what I am!\" No tears\r\nflowed to soften this thought. The bright green country--the meadows\r\nmingled with unripe corn-fields--the tufted woods--the hedgerows full of\r\nflowers, could not attract her eye; pangs every now and then seized upon\r\nher heart--she had talked of resignation, but she was delivered up to\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nAt length she sank into a kind of stupor. She was accompanied by one\r\nservant only; she had told him where she intended to remain that night.\r\nIt was past eleven before they arrived at Reading; the night was chill,\r\nand she shivered while she felt as if it were impossible to move, even\r\nto draw up the glasses of her chariot. When she arrived at the inn where\r\nshe was to pass the night, she felt keenly the discomfort of having no\r\nfemale attendant. It was new--she felt as if it were disgraceful, to\r\nfind herself alone among strangers, to be obliged to give orders\r\nherself, and to prepare alone for her repose.\r\n\r\nAll night she could not sleep, and she became aware at last that she was\r\nill. She burnt with fever--her whole frame was tormented by aches, by\r\nalternate hot and shivering fits, and by a feeling of sickness. When\r\nmorning dawned, it was worse. She grew impatient--she rose. She had\r\narranged that her servant should quit her at this place. He had been but\r\na short time with her, and was easily dismissed under the idea, that she\r\nwas to be joined by a man recommended by a friend, who was accustomed to\r\nthe continent, whither it was supposed that she was going. She had\r\ndismissed him the night before, he was already gone, when on the morrow\r\nshe ordered the horses.--She paid the bills herself--and had to answer\r\nquestions about luggage; all these things are customary to the poor, and\r\nto the other sex. But take a high-born woman and place her in immediate\r\ncontact with the rough material of the world, and see how like a\r\nsensitive plant she will shrink, close herself up and droop, and feel as\r\nif she had fallen from her native sphere into a spot unknown, ungenial,\r\nand full of storms.\r\n\r\nThe illness that oppressed Lady Lodore, made these natural feelings even\r\nmore acute, till at last they were blunted by the same cause. She now\r\nwondered what it was that ailed her, and became terrified at the\r\noccasional wanderings that interrupted her torpor. Once or twice she\r\nwished to speak to the post-boy, but her voice failed her. At length\r\nthey drove up to the inn at Newbury; fresh horses were called for, and\r\nthe landlady came up to the door of the carriage, to ask whether the\r\nlady had breakfasted--whether she would take anything. There was\r\nsomething ghastly in Lady Lodore's appearance, which at once frightened\r\nthe good woman, and excited her compassion. She renewed her questions,\r\nwhich Lady Lodore had not at first heard, adding, \"You seem ill, ma'am;\r\ndo take something--had you not better alight?\"\r\n\r\n\"O yes, far better,\" said Cornelia, \"for I think I must be very ill.\"\r\n\r\nThe change of posture and cessation of motion a little revived her, and\r\nshe began to think that she was mistaken, and that it was all nothing,\r\nand that she was well. She was conducted into the parlour of the inn,\r\nand the landlady left her to order refreshment. \"How foolish I am,\" she\r\nthought; \"this is mere fancy; there is nothing the matter with me;\" and\r\nshe rose to ring the bell, and to order horses. When suddenly, without\r\nany previous warning, struck as by a bolt, she fainted, and fell on the\r\nfloor, without any power of saving herself. The sound of her fall\r\nquickened the steps of the landlady, who was returning; all the\r\nchamber-maids were summoned, a doctor sent for, and when Lady Lodore opened\r\nher eyes she saw unknown faces about her, a strange place, and voices yet\r\nstranger. She did not speak, but tried to collect her thoughts, and to\r\nunravel the mystery, as it appeared, of her situation. But soon her\r\nthoughts wandered, and fever and weakness made her yield to the\r\nsolicitations of those around. The doctor came, and could make out\r\nnothing but that she was in a high fever: he ordered her to be put to\r\nbed. And thus--Saville, and Ethel, and all hopes and fears, having\r\nvanished from her thoughts,--given up to delirium and suffering, poor\r\nLady Lodore, alone, unknown, and unattended, remained for several weeks\r\nat a country inn--under the hands of a village doctor--to recover, if\r\nGod pleased, if not, to sink, unmourned and unheard of, into an untimely\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if for me thou dost forsake\r\nSome other maid, and rudely break\r\nHer worshipped image from its base,\r\nTo give to me the ruined place--\r\n\r\nThen fare thee well--I'd rather make\r\nMy bower upon some icy lake,\r\nWhen thawing suns begin to shine,\r\nThan trust to love so false as thine!\r\n\r\nLALLA ROOKH.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the same day Mr. and Mrs. Villiers left their sad dwelling to take\r\npossession of lady Lodore's house. The generosity and kindness of her\r\nmother, such as it appeared, though she knew but the smallest portion of\r\nit, charmed Ethel. Her heart, which had so long struggled to love her, was\r\ngladdened by the proofs given that she deserved her warmest affection.\r\nThe truest delight beamed from her lovely countenance. Even she had felt\r\nthe gloom and depression of adversity. The sight of misery or vice in\r\nthose around her tarnished the holy fervour with which she would\r\notherwise have made every sacrifice for Edward's sake. There is\r\nsomething in this world, which even while it gives an unknown grace to\r\nrough, and hard, and mean circumstances, contaminates the beauty and\r\nharmony of the noble and exalted. Ethel had been aware of this; she\r\ndreaded its sinister influence over Villiers, and in spite of herself\r\nshe pined; she had felt with a shudder that in spite of love and\r\nfortitude, a sense, chilling and deponding, was creeping over her,\r\nmaking her feel the earth alien to her, and calling her away from the\r\nsadness of the scene around to a world bright and pure as herself. Her\r\nvery despair thus dressed itself in the garb of religion; and though\r\nthese visitations of melancholy only came during the absence of Villiers\r\nand were never indulged in, yet they were too natural a growth of their\r\nwretched abode to be easily or entirely dismissed. Even now that she was\r\nrestored to the fairer scenes of life, compassion for the unfortunate\r\nbeings she quitted haunted her, and her feelings were too keenly alive\r\nto the miseries which her fellow-creatures suffered, to permit her to be\r\nrelieved from all pain by her own exemption. She turned from such\r\nreflections to the image of her dear kind mother with delight. The roof\r\nthat sheltered her was hallowed as hers; all the blessings of life which\r\nshe enjoyed came to her from the same source as life itself. She\r\ndelighted to trace the current of feeling which had occasioned her to\r\ngive up so much, and to imagine the sweetness of disposition, the\r\nvivacity of mind, the talents and accomplishments which her physiognomy\r\nexpressed, and the taste manifested in her house, and all the things\r\nwhich she had collected around her, evinced.\r\n\r\nIn less than a month after their liberation, she gave birth to son. The\r\nmingled danger and rejoicing attendant on this event, imparted fresh\r\nstrength to the attachment that united Edward to her; and the little\r\nstranger himself was a new object of tenderness and interest. Thus their\r\ndays of mourning were exchanged for a happiness most natural and welcome\r\nto the human heart. At this time also Horatio Saville returned from\r\nItaly with his little girl. She was scarcely more than a year old, but\r\ndisplayed an intelligence to be equalled only by her extraordinary\r\nbeauty. Her golden silken ringlets were even then profuse, her eyes were\r\nas dark and brilliant as her mother's, but her complexion was fair, and\r\nthe same sweet smile flitted round her infant mouth, as gave the charm\r\nto her father's face. He idolized her, and tried by his tenderness and\r\nattention to appease, as it were, the manes of the unfortunate Clorinda.\r\n\r\nShe, poor girl, had been the victim of the violence of passion and\r\nill-regulated feelings native to her country, excited into unnatural\r\nforce by the singularity of her fate. When Saville saw her first in her\r\nconvent, she was pining for liberty; she did not think of any joy beyond\r\nescaping the troublesome impertinence of the nuns and the monotonous\r\ntenor of monastic life, of associating with people she loved, and\r\nenjoying the common usages of life, unfettered by the restrictions that\r\nrendered her present existence a burthen. But though she desired no\r\nmore, her disgust for the present, her longing for a change, was a\r\npowerful passion. She was adorned by talents, by genius; she was\r\neloquent and beautiful, and full of enthusiasm and feeling. Saville\r\npitied her; he lamented her future fate among her unworthy countrymen;\r\nhe longed to cherish, to comfort, and to benefit her. His heart, so\r\neasily won to tenderness, gave her readily a brother's regard. Others,\r\nseeing the active benevolence and lively interest that this sentiment\r\nelicited, might have fancied him inspired by a warmer feeling; but he\r\nwell knew the difference, he ardently desired her happiness, but did not\r\nseek his own in her.\r\n\r\nHe visited her frequently, he brought her books, he taught her English.\r\nThey were allowed to meet daily in the parlour of the convent, in the\r\npresence of a female attendant; and his admiration of her talents, her\r\nimagination, her ardent comprehensive mind, increased on every\r\ninterview. They talked of literature--the poets--the arts; Clorinda sang\r\nto him, and her fine voice, cultivated by the nicest art, was a source\r\nof deep pleasure and pain to her auditor. His sensibility was awakened\r\nby the tones of love and rapture--sensibility, not alas! for her who\r\nsang, but for the false and absent. While listening, his fancy recalled\r\nLady Lodore's image; the hopes she had inspired, the rapture he had felt in\r\nher presence--the warm vivifying effect her voice and looks had on him\r\nwere remembered, and his heart sank within him to think that all this\r\nsweetness was deceptive, fleeting, lost. Once, overcome by these\r\nthoughts, he resolved to return suddenly to England, to make one effort\r\nmore to exchange unendurable wretchedness for the most transporting\r\nhappiness;--absence from Cornelia, to the joy of pouring out the\r\noverflowing sentiments of his heart at her feet. While indulging in this\r\nidea, a letter from his sister Lucy caused a painful revulsion; she\r\npainted the woman of the world given up to ambition and fashion,\r\nrejoicing in his departure, and waiting only the moment when she might\r\nwith decency become the wife of another. Saville was almost maddened--he\r\ndid not visit Clorinda for three days. She received him, when at last he\r\ncame, without reproach, but with transport; she saw that sadness, even\r\nsickness, dimmed his eye; she soothed him, she hung over him with\r\nfondness, she sung to him her sweetest, softest airs; his heart melted,\r\na tear stole from his eye. Clorinda saw his emotion; it excited hers;\r\nher Neapolitan vivacity was not restrained by shame nor fear,--she spoke\r\nof her love for him with the vehemence she felt, and youth and beauty\r\nhallowed the frankness and energy of her expressions. Saville was\r\ntouched and pleased,--he left her to meditate on this new state of\r\nthings--for free from passion himself, he had never suspected the growth\r\nof it in her heart. He reflected on all her admirable qualities, and the\r\npity it was that they should be cast at the feet of one of her own\r\nunrefined, uneducated countrymen, who would be incapable of appreciating\r\nher talents--even her love--so that at last she would herself become\r\ndegraded, and sink into that system of depravity which makes a prey of\r\nall that is lovely or noble in our nature. He could save her--she loved\r\nhim, and he could save her; lost as he was to real happiness, it were to\r\napproximate to it, if he consecrated his life to her welfare.\r\n\r\nYet he would not deceive her. The excess of love which she bestowed\r\ndemanded a return which he could not give. She must choose whether, such\r\nas he was, he were worth accepting. Actuated by a sense of justice, he\r\nopened his heart to her without disguise: he told her of his ill-fated\r\nattachment to another--of his self-banishment, and misery--he declared\r\nhis real and earnest affection for her--his desire to rescue her from\r\nher present fate, and to devote his life to her. Clorinda scarcely heard\r\nwhat he said,--she felt only that she might become his--that he would\r\nmarry her; her rapture was undisguised, and he enjoyed the felicity of\r\nbelieving that one so lovely and excellent would at once owe every\r\nblessing of life to him, and that the knowledge of this must ensure his\r\nown content. The consent of her parents was easily yielded,--the Pope is\r\nalways ready to grant a dispensation to a Catholic wife marrying a\r\nProtestant husband,--the wedding speedily took place--and Saville became\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\nTheir mutual torments now began. Horatio was a man of high and\r\nunshrinking principle. He never permitted himself to think of Lady Lodore,\r\nand the warmth and tenderness of his heart led him to attach himself truly\r\nand affectionately to his wife. But this did not suffice for the\r\nNeapolitan. Her marriage withdrew the veil of life--she imagined that\r\nshe distinguished the real from the fictitious, but her new sense of\r\ndiscernment was the source of torture. She desired to be loved as she\r\nloved; she insisted that her rival should be hated--she was shaken by\r\ncontinual tempests of jealousy, and the violence of her temper,\r\nrestrained by no reserve of disposition, displayed itself frightfully.\r\nSaville reasoned, reproached, reprehended, without any avail, except\r\nthat when her violence had passed its crisis, she repented, and wept,\r\nand besought forgiveness. Ethel's visit had been a blow hard to bear.\r\nShe was the daughter of her whom Saville loved--whom he regretted--on\r\nwhom he expended that passion and idolatry, to attain which she would\r\nhave endured the most dreadful tortures. These were the reflections, or\r\nrather, these were the ravings, of Clorinda. She had never been so\r\nfurious in her jealousy, or so frequent in her fits of passion, as\r\nduring the visit of the unconscious and gentle Ethel.\r\n\r\nThe birth of her child operated a beneficial change for a time; and\r\nexcept when Saville spoke of England, or she imagined that he was\r\nthinking of it, she ceased to torment him. He was glad; but the moment\r\nwas passed when she could command his esteem, or excite his spontaneous\r\nsympathy. He pitied and he loved her; but it was almost as we may become\r\nattached to an unfortunate and lovely maniac; less than ever did he seek\r\nhis happiness in her. He loved his infant daughter now better than any\r\nother earthly thing. Clorinda rejoiced in this tie, though she soon grew\r\njealous even of her own child.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Lord Maristow and his daughters was at first full of\r\nbenefit to the discordant pair. Clorinda was really desirous of\r\nobtaining their esteem, and she exerted herself to please: when they\r\ntalked of her return to England with them, it only excited her to try to\r\nrender Italy so agreeable as to induce them to remain there. They were\r\nnot like Ethel. They were good girls, but fashionable and fond of\r\npleasure. Clorinda devised a thousand amusements--concerts, tableaux,\r\nthe masquerades of the carnival, were all put in requisition. They\r\ncarried their zeal for amusement so far as to take up their abode for a\r\nday or two at Pompeii, feigning to be its ancient inhabitants, and,\r\nbringing the _corps operatique_ to their aid, got up Rossini's opera of\r\nthe Ultimi Giorni di Pompeii among the ruins, ending their masquerade by\r\na mimic eruption. These gaieties did not accord with the classic and\r\nrefined tastes of Saville; but he was glad to find his wife and sisters\r\nagree so well, and under the blue sky, and in the laughing land of\r\nNaples, it was impossible not to find beauty and enjoyment even in\r\nextravagance and folly.\r\n\r\nStill, like a funeral bell heard amidst a feast, the name of England,\r\nand the necessity of her going thither, struck on the ear and chilled\r\nthe heart of the Neapolitan. She resolved never to go; but how could she\r\nrefuse to accompany her husband's sisters? how resist the admonitions\r\nand commands of his father? She did not refuse therefore--she seemed to\r\nconsent--while she said to Saville, \"Poison, stab me--cast me down the\r\ncrater of the mountain--exhaust your malice and hatred on me as you\r\nplease here--but you shall never take me to England but as a corpse.\"\r\n\r\nSaville replied, \"As you will.\" He was tired of the struggle, and left\r\nthe management of his departure to others.\r\n\r\nOne day his sisters described the delights of a London season, and\r\nstrove to win Clorinda by the mention of its balls, parties, and opera;\r\nthey spoke of Almack's, and the leaders of fashion; they mentioned Lady\r\nLodore. They were unaware that Clorinda knew any thing of their brother's\r\nattachment, and speaking of her as one of the most distinguished of\r\ntheir associates in the London world, made their sister-in-law aware,\r\nthat when she made a part of it, she would come into perpetual contact\r\nwith her rival. This allusion caused one of her most violent paroxysms\r\nof rage as soon as she found herself alone with her husband. So frantic\r\ndid she seem, that Horatio spoke seriously to his father, and declared\r\nhe knew of no argument nor power which could induce Clorinda to\r\naccompany them to England. \"Then you must go without her,\" said Lord\r\nMaristow; \"your career, your family, your country, must not be\r\nsacrificed to her unreasonable folly.\" And then, wholly unaware of the\r\ncharacter of the person with whom he had to deal, he repeated the same\r\nthing to Clorinda. \"You must choose,\" he said, \"between Naples and your\r\nhusband--he must go; do you prefer being left behind?\"\r\n\r\nClorinda grew pale, even livid. She returned home. Horatio was not\r\nthere; she raved through her house like a maniac; her servants even hid\r\nher child from her, and she rushed from room to room tearing her hair,\r\nand calling for Saville. At length he entered; her eyes were starting\r\nfrom her head, her frame working with convulsive violence; she strove to\r\nspeak--to give utterance to the vehemence pent up within her. She darted\r\ntowards him; when suddenly, as if shot to the heart, she fell on the\r\nmarble pavement of her chamber, and a red stream poured from her\r\nlips--she had burst a blood-vessel.\r\n\r\nFor many days she was not allowed to speak nor move. Saville nursed her\r\nunremittingly--he watched by her at night--he tried to soothe her--he\r\nbrought her child to her side--his sweetness, and gentleness, and real\r\ntenderness were all expended on her. Although violent, she was not\r\nungenerous. She was touched by his attentions, and the undisguished\r\nsolicitude of his manner. She resolved to conquer herself, and in a fit\r\nof heroism formed the determination to yield, and to go to England. Her\r\nfirst words, when permitted to speak, were to signify her assent.\r\nSaville kissed and thanked her. She had half imagined that he would\r\nimitate her generosity, and give up the journey. No such thought crossed\r\nhis mind; her distaste was too unreasonable to elicit the smallest\r\nsympathy, and consequently any concession. He thanked her warmly, it is\r\ntrue; and looked delighted at this change, but without giving her time\r\nto retract, he hurried to communicate to his relations the agreeable\r\ntidings.\r\n\r\nAs she grew better she did not recede, but she felt miserable. The good\r\nspirits and ready preparations of Horatio were all acts of treason\r\nagainst her: sometimes she felt angry--but she checked herself. Like all\r\nItalians, Clorinda feared death excessively; besides that, to die was to\r\nyield the entire victory to her rival. She struggled therefore, and\r\nconquered herself; and neither expressed her angry jealousy nor her\r\nterrors. She had many causes of fear; she was again in a situation to\r\nincrease her family within a few months; and while her safety depended\r\non her being able to attain a state of calm, she feared a confinement in\r\nEngland, and believed that it was impossible that she should survive.\r\n\r\nShe was worn to a skeleton--her large eyes were sunk and ringed with\r\nblack, while they burnt with unnatural brilliancy, for her vivacity did\r\nnot desert her, and that deceived those around; they fancied that she\r\nwas convalescent, and would soon recover strength and good looks, while\r\nshe nourished a deep sense of wrong for the slight attention paid to her\r\nsufferings. She wept over herself and her friendless state. Her husband\r\nwas not her friend, for he was not her countryman: and full as Saville\r\nwas of generous sympathy and kindliness for all, the idea of returning\r\nto England, to his home and friends, to the stirring scenes of life, and\r\nthe society of those who loved literature, and were endowed with the\r\nspirit of liberal inquiry and manly habits of thinking, so absorbed and\r\ndelighted him, that he could only thank Clorinda again and again--caress\r\nher, and entreat her to get well, that she might share his pleasures.\r\nHis words chilled her, and she shrunk from his caresses. \"He is thinking\r\nof her, and of seeing her again,\" she thought. She did him the most\r\nflagrant injustice. Saville was a man of high and firm principle, and\r\nhad he been aware of any latent weakness, of any emotion allied to the\r\nmaster-passion of his soul, he would have conquered it, or have fled\r\nfrom the temptation. He never thought less of Lady Lodore than now. The\r\nunwonted gentleness and concessions of his wife--his love for his child,\r\nand the presence of his father and dear sisters, dissipated his\r\nregrets,--his conscience was wholly at ease, and he was happy.\r\n\r\nClorinda dared not complain to her English relatives, but she listened\r\nto the lamentations of her Neapolitan friends with a luxury of woe. They\r\nmourned over her as if she were going to visit another sphere; they\r\npointed out the little island on a map, and seated far off as it was\r\namidst the northern sea, night and storms, they averred, perpetually\r\nbrooded over it, while from the shape of the earth they absolutely\r\nproved that it was impossible to get there. It is true that Lord\r\nMaristow and his daughters, and Saville himself, had come thence--that\r\nwas nothing--it was easy to come away. \"You see,\" they said, \"the earth\r\nslopes down, and the sun is before them; but when they have to go back,\r\nah! it is quite another affair; the Alps rise, and the sea boils over,\r\nand they have to toil up the wall of the world itself into winter and\r\ndarkness. It is tempting God to go there. O stay, Clorinda, stay in\r\nsunny Italy. Orazio will return: do not go to die in that miserable\r\nbirth-place of night and frost.\"\r\n\r\nClorinda wept yet more bitterly over her hard fate, and the\r\nimpossibility of yielding to their wishes. \"Would to God,\" she thought,\r\n\"I could abandon the ingrate, and let him go far from Italy and\r\nClorinda, to die in his wretched country! Would I could forget, hate,\r\ndesert him! Ah, why do I idolize one born in that chilly land, where\r\nlove and passion are unknown or despised!\"\r\n\r\nAt length the day arrived when they left Naples. It was the month of\r\nMay, and very warm. No imagination could paint the glorious beauty of\r\nthis country of enchantment, on the completion of spring, before the\r\nheats of summer had withered its freshness. The sparkling waves of the\r\nblue Mediterranean encircled the land, and contrasted with its hues: the\r\nrich foliage of the trees--the festooning of the luxuriant vines, and\r\nthe abundant vegetation which sprung fresh from the soil, decorating the\r\nrocks, and mantling the earth with flowers and verdure, were all in the\r\nvery prime and blossoming of beauty. The sisters of Saville expressed\r\ntheir admiration in warm and enthusiastic terms; the words trembled on\r\npoor Clorinda's lips; she was about to say, \"Why then desert this land\r\nof bliss?\" but Horatio spoke instead: \"It is splendid, I own, and once I\r\nfelt all that you express. Now a path along a grassy field--a\r\nhedge-row--a copse with a rill murmuring through it--a white cottage\r\nwith simple palings enclosing a flower-garden--the spire of a country\r\nchurch rising from among a tuft of elms--the skies all shadowy with soft\r\nclouds--and the homesteads of a happy thriving peasantry--these are the\r\nthings I sigh for. A true English home-scene seems to me a thousand\r\ntimes more beautiful, as it must be a thousand times dearer than the\r\ngarish showy splendour of Naples.\"\r\n\r\nClorinda's thoughts crept back into her chilled heart; large tear-drops\r\nrose in her eyes, but she concealed them, and shrinking into a corner of\r\nthe carriage, she felt more lonely and deserted than she would have done\r\namong strangers who had loved Italy, and participated in her feelings.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at the inn called the Villa di Cicerone, at the Mola di\r\nGaeta. All the beauty of the most beautiful part of the Peninsula seems\r\nconcentered in that enchanting spot--the perfume of orange flowers\r\nfilled the air--the sea was at their feet--the vine-clad hills around.\r\nAll this excess of loveliness only added to the unutterable misery of\r\nthe Neapolitan girl. Her companions talked and laughed, while she felt\r\nher frame convulsed by internal combats, and the unwonted command she\r\nexercised over her habitual vehemence. Horatio conversed gaily with his\r\nsisters, till catching a glimpse of the pale face of his wretched wife,\r\nher mournful eyes and wasted cheeks, he drew near her. \"You are\r\nfatigued, dearest Clorinda,\" he said, \"will you not go to rest?\"\r\n\r\nHe said this in a tender caressing tone, but she felt, \"He wants to send\r\nme away--to get rid even of the sight of me.\" But he sat down by her,\r\nand perceiving her dejection, and guessing partly at its cause, he\r\nsoothed her, and talked of their return to her native land, and cheered\r\nher by expressions of gratitude for the sacrifice she was making. Her\r\nheart began to soften, and her tears to flow more freely, when a man\r\nentered, such as haunt the inns in Italy, and watch for the arrival of\r\nrich strangers to make profit in various ways out of them. This man had\r\na small picture for sale, which he declared to be an original Carlo\r\nDolce. It was the head of a seraph painted on copper--it was probably a\r\ncopy, but it was beautifully executed; besides the depth of colour and\r\ngrace of design, there was something singularly beautiful in the\r\nexpression of the countenance portrayed,--it symbolized happiness and\r\nlove; a beaming softness animated the whole face; a perfect joy, an\r\nineffable radiance shone out of it. Clorinda took it in her hand--the\r\nrepresentation of heart-felt gladness increased her self-pity; she was\r\nturning towards her husband with a reproachful look, thinking, \"Such\r\nsmiles you have banished from my face for ever,\"--when Sophia Saville,\r\nwho was looking over her shoulder, exclaimed, \"What an extraordinary\r\nresemblance! there was never any thing so like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who? what?\" asked her sister.\r\n\r\n\"It is Lady Lodore herself,\" replied Sophia; \"her eyes, her mouth, her very\r\nsmile.\"\r\n\r\nLucy gave a quick glance towards her brother. Horatio involuntarily\r\nstepped forward to look, and then as hastily drew back. Clorinda saw it\r\nall--she put down the picture, and left the room--she could not\r\nstay--she could not speak--she knew not what she felt, but that a fiery\r\ntorture was eating into her, and she must fly, she knew not whither.\r\nSaville was pained; he hesitated what to do or say--so he remained;\r\nsupper was brought in, and Clorinda not appearing, it was supposed that\r\nshe had retired to rest. In about an hour and a half after, Horatio went\r\ninto her room, and to his horror beheld her stretched upon the cold\r\nbricks of the chamber, senseless; the moon-beams rested on her pale\r\nface, which bore the hues of death. In a moment the house was alarmed,\r\nthe village doctor summoned, a courier dispatched to Naples for an\r\nEnglish physician, and every possible aid-afforded the wretched\r\nsufferer. She was placed on the bed,--she still lived; her faint pulse\r\ncould not be felt, and no blood flowed when a vein was opened, but she\r\ngroaned, and now and then opened her eyes with a ghastly stare, and\r\nclosed them again as if mechanically. All was horror and despair--no\r\nhelp--no resource presented itself; they hung round her, they listened\r\nto her groans with terror, and yet they were the only signs of life that\r\ndisturbed her death-like state. At last, soon after the dawn of day, she\r\nbecame convulsed, her pulse fluttered, and blood flowed from her wounded\r\narm; in about an hour from this time she gave birth to a dead child.\r\nAfter this she grew calmer and fainter. The physician arrived, but she\r\nwas past mortal cure,--she never opened her eyes more, nor spoke, nor\r\ngave any token of consciousness. By degrees her groans ceased, and she\r\nfaded into death: the slender manifestations of lingering vitality\r\ngradually decreasing till all was still and cold. After an hour or two\r\nher face resumed its loveliness, pale and wasted as it was: she seemed\r\nto sleep, and none could regret that repose possessed that heart, which\r\nhad been alive only to the deadliest throes of unhappy passion. Yet\r\nSaville did more than regret--he mourned her sincerely and deeply,--he\r\naccused himself of hard-heartedness,--he remembered what she was when he\r\nhad first seen her;--how full of animation, beauty, and love. He did not\r\nremember that she had perished the victim of uncontrolled passion; he\r\nfelt that she was his victim. He would have given worlds to restore her\r\nto life and enjoyment. What was a residence in England--the promises of\r\nambition--the pleasures of his native land--all that he could feel or\r\nknow, compared to the existence of one so young, so blessed with\r\nHeaven's choicest gifts of mind and person. She was his victim, and he\r\ncould never forgive himself.\r\n\r\nFor his father's and sisters' sake he subdued the expression of his\r\ngrief, for they also loved Clorinda, and were struck with sorrow at the\r\nsudden catastrophe. His strong mind, also, before long, mastered the\r\nfalse view he had taken of the cause of her death. He lamented her\r\ndeeply, but he did not give way to unavailing remorse, which was founded\r\non his sensibility, and not on any just cause for repentance. He turned\r\nall his thoughts to repairing her errors, rather than his own, by\r\ncherishing her child with redoubled fondness. The little girl was too\r\nyoung to feel her loss; she had always loved her father, and now she\r\nclung to his bosom and pressed her infant lips to his cheek, and by her\r\nplayfulness and caresses repaid him for the tenderness that he lavished\r\non her.\r\n\r\nAfter some weeks spent in the north of Italy he returned to England with\r\nher. Lord Maristow and his daughters were already there, and had gone to\r\nMaristow Castle. Saville took up his abode with his cousin Villiers. His\r\nsituation was new and strange. He found himself in the very abode of the\r\ndreaded Cornelia, yet she was away, unheard of, almost, it seemed,\r\nforgotten. Did he think of her as he saw the traces of by-gone scenes\r\naround? He played with his child--he secluded himself among his\r\nbooks--he talked with Ethel of what had happened since their parting,\r\nand reproached Villiers bitterly for not having applied to him in his\r\ndistress. But a kind of spell sealed the lips of each, and Lady Lodore, who\r\nwas the living spirit of the scene around--the creator of its peace and\r\nhappiness--seemed to have passed away from the memory of all. It was in\r\nappearance only. Not an hour, not a minute of the day passed, that did\r\nnot bring her idea to their minds, and Saville and Ethel each longed for\r\nthe word to be uttered by either, which would permit them to give\r\nexpression to the thoughts that so entirely possessed them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe music\r\nOf man's fair composition best accords,\r\nWhen 'tis in consort, not in single strains:\r\nMy heart has been untuned these many months,\r\nWanting her presence, in whose equal love\r\nTrue harmony consisted.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of September the whole party assembled at Maristow\r\nCastle. Even Mrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry was among the guests. She had not\r\nvisited Ethel in London, because she would not enter Lady Lodore's house,\r\nbut she had the true spinster's desire of seeing the baby, and thus\r\novercame her reluctance to quitting Longfield for a few weeks. Fanny Derham\r\nalso accompanied them, unable to deny Ethel's affectionate entreaties.\r\nFanny's situation had been beneficially changed. Sir Gilbert Derham,\r\nfinding that his granddaughter associated with people _in the world_, and\r\nbeing applied to by Lord Maristow, was induced to withdraw Mrs. Derham\r\nfrom her mean situation, and to settle a small fortune on each of her\r\nchildren. Fanny was too young, and too wedded to her platonic notions of\r\nthe supremacy of mind, to be fully aware of the invaluable advantages of\r\npecuniary independence for a woman. She fancied that she could enter on\r\nthe career--the only career permitted her sex--of servitude, and yet\r\npossess her soul in freedom and power. She had never, indeed, thought\r\nmuch of these things: life was, as it concerned herself, a system of\r\nwords only. As always happens to the young, she only knew suffering\r\nthrough her affections, and the real chain of life--its necessities and\r\ncares--and the sinister influences exercised by the bad passions of our\r\nfellow-creatures--had not yet begun to fetter her aspiring thoughts.\r\nBeautiful in her freedom, in her enthusiasm, and even in her learning,\r\nbut, above all, in the lively kindliness of her heart, she excited the\r\nwonder and commanded the affections of all. Saville had never seen any\r\none like her--she brought to his recollection his own young feelings\r\nbefore experience had lifted \"the painted veil which those who live call\r\nlife,\" or passion and sorrow had tamed the ardour of his mind; he looked\r\non her with admiration, and yet with compassion, wondering where and how\r\nthe evil spirit of the world would show its power to torment, and\r\nconquer the free soul of the disciple of wisdom.\r\n\r\nYet Saville's own mind was rather rebuked than tamed: he knew what\r\nsuffering was, yet he knew also how to endure it, and to turn it to\r\nadvantage, deriving thence lessons of fortitude, of forbearance, and\r\neven of hope. It was not, however, till the seal on his lips was taken\r\noff, and the name of Cornelia mentioned, that he became aware that the\r\nsame heart warmed his bosom, as had been the cause at once of such\r\nrapture and misery in former times. Yet even now he did not acknowledge\r\nto himself that he still loved, passionately, devotedly loved, Lady Lodore.\r\nThe image of the pale Clorinda stretched on the pavement--his\r\nvictim--still dwelt in his memory, and he made a sacrifice at her tomb\r\nof every living feeling of his own. He fancied, therefore, that he spoke\r\ncoldly of Cornelia, with speculation only, while in fact, at the very\r\nmention of her name a revulsion took place in his being--his eyes\r\nbrightened, his face beamed with animation, his very figure enlarged,\r\nhis heart was on fire within him. Villiers saw and appreciated these\r\ntokens of passion; but Ethel only perceived an interest in her mother,\r\nshared with herself, and was half angry that he made no professions of\r\nthe constancy of his attachment.\r\n\r\nStill, day after day, and soon, all day long, they talked of Lady Lodore.\r\nNone but a lover and a daughter could have adhered so pertinaciously to one\r\nsubject; and thus Saville and Ethel were often left to themselves, or\r\njoined only by Fanny. Fanny was very mysterious and alarming in what she\r\nsaid of her beautiful and interesting favourite. While Ethel lamented\r\nher mother's love of the continent, conjectured concerning her return,\r\nand dwelt on the pleasures of their future intercourse, Fanny shook her\r\nhead, and said, \"It was strange, very strange, that not one letter had\r\nyet reached them from her.\" She was asked to explain, but she could only\r\nsay, that when she last saw Lady Lodore, she was impressed by the idea\r\nthat all was not as it seemed. She tried to appear as if acting\r\naccording to the ordinary routine of life, and yet was evidently\r\nagitated by violent and irrepressible feeling. Her manner, she had\r\nherself fancied, to be calm, and yet it betrayed a wandering of thought,\r\na fear of being scrutinized, manifested in her repetition of the same\r\nphrases, and in the earnestness with which she made assurances\r\nconcerning matters of the most trivial import. This was all that Fanny\r\ncould say, but she was intimately persuaded of the correctness of her\r\nobservation, and lamented that she had not inquired further and\r\ndiscovered more. \"For,\" she said, \"the mystery, whatever it is, springs\r\nfrom the most honourable motives. There was nothing personal nor\r\nfrivolous in the feelings that mastered her;\" and Fanny feared that at\r\nthat very moment she was sacrificing herself to some project--some\r\ndetermination, which, while it benefited others, was injuring herself.\r\nEthel, with all her affection for her mother, was not persuaded of the\r\njustice of these suspicions, nor could be brought to acknowledge that\r\nthe mystery of Lady Lodore's absence was induced by any motives as\r\nstrange and forcible as those suggested by Fanny; but believed that her\r\nyoung friend was carried away by her own imagination and high-flown\r\nideas. Saville was operated differently upon. He became uneasy,\r\nthoughtful, restless: a thousand times he was on the point of setting\r\nout to find a clue to the mystery, and to discover the abode of the\r\nrunaway,--but he was restrained. It is usually supposed that women are\r\nalways under the influence of one sentiment, and if Lady Lodore acted\r\nunder the direction and for the sake of another, wherefore should\r\nSaville interfere? what right had he to investigate her secrets, and\r\ndisturb her arrangements?\r\n\r\nSeveral months passed. Mrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry returned to Longfield,\r\nand still the mystery concerning Ethel's mother continued, and the\r\nwonder increased, Soon after Christmas Mr. Gayland, who was also Lord\r\nMaristow's solicitor, came down to the Castle for a few days. He made\r\ninquiries concerning Lady Lodore, and was somewhat surprised at her strange\r\ndisappearance and protracted absence. He asked several questions, and\r\nseemed to form conclusions in his own mind; he excited the curiosity of\r\nall, yet restrained himself from satisfying it; he was evidently\r\ndisquieted by her unbroken silence, yet feared to betray the origin of\r\nhis uneasiness.\r\n\r\nWhile he remained curiosity was dominant: when he went he requested\r\nVilliers to be good enough to let him know if any thing should be heard\r\nof Lady Lodore. He asked this more than once, and required an absolute\r\npromise. After his departure, his questions, his manner, and his last\r\nwords recurred, exciting even more surprise than when he had been\r\npresent. Fanny brought forward all he said to support her own\r\nconjectures; a shadow of disquiet crossed Ethel's mind; she asked\r\nVilliers to take some steps to discover where her mother was, and on his\r\nrefusal argued earnestly, though vainly, to persuade him to comply.\r\nVilliers was actuated by the common-place maxim of not interfering with\r\nthe actions and projects of others. \"Lady Lodore is not a child,\" he\r\nsaid, \"she knows what she is about--has she not always avoided you,\r\nEthel? Why press yourself inopportunely upon her?\"\r\n\r\nBut Ethel was not now to be convinced by the repetition of these\r\narguments. She urged her mother's kindness and sacrifice; her having\r\ngiven up her home to them; her house still unclaimed by her, still at\r\ntheir disposal, and which contained so many things which must have been\r\nendeared by long use and habit, and the relinquishing of which showed\r\nsomething extraordinary in her motives. This was a woman's feeling, and\r\nmade little impression on Villiers--he was willing to praise and to\r\nthank Lady Lodore for her generosity and kindness, but he suspected nothing\r\nbeyond her acknowledged acts.\r\n\r\nSaville heard this disquisition; he wished Villiers to be convinced--he\r\nwas persuaded that Ethel was right--he was angry at his cousin's\r\nobstinacy--he was miserable at the idea that Cornelia should feel\r\nherself treated with neglect--that she should need protection and not\r\nhave it--that she should be alone, and not find assistance proffered,\r\nurged upon her. He mounted his horse and took a solitary ride,\r\nmeditating on these things--his imagination became heated, his soul on\r\nfire. He pictured Lady Lodore in solitude and desertion, and his heart\r\nboiled within him. Was she sick, and none near her?--was she dead, and her\r\ngrave unvisited and unknown? A lover's fancy is as creative as a poet's\r\nand when once it takes hold of any idea, it clings to it tenaciously. If\r\nit is thus even with ordinary minds, how much more with Saville, with\r\nall energy which was his characteristic, and the latent fire of love\r\nburning in his heart. His resolution was sudden, and acted on at once.\r\nHe turned his horse's head towards London. On reaching the nearest town,\r\nhe ordered a chaise and four post horses. He wrote a few hurried lines\r\nannouncing an absence of two or three days, and with the rapidity that\r\nalways attended the conception of his purposes and their execution, the\r\nnext morning, having travelled all night, he was in Mr. Gayland's\r\noffice, questioning that gentleman concerning Lady Lodore, and seeking\r\nfrom him all the light he could throw upon her long-continued and\r\nmysterious absence.\r\n\r\nMr. Gayland had promised Lady Lodore not to reveal her secret to Mr. or\r\nMrs. Villiers; but he felt himself free to communicate it to any other\r\nperson. He was very glad to get rid of the burden and even the\r\nresponsibility of being her sole confidant. He related all he knew to\r\nSaville, and the truth flashed on the lover's mind. His imagination\r\ncould not dupe him--he could conceive, and therefore believe in her\r\ngenerosity, her magnanimity. He had before, in some degree, divined the\r\ngreatness of mind of which Lady Lodore was capable; though as far as\r\nregarded himself, her pride, and his modesty, had deceived him. Now he\r\nbecame at once aware that Cornelia had beggared herself for Ethel's\r\nsake. She had disposed of her jointure, given up the residue of her\r\nincome, and wandered away, poor and alone, to avoid the discovery of the\r\nextent and consequences of her sacrifices. Saville left Mr. Gayland's\r\noffice with a bursting and a burning heart. At once he paid a warm\r\ntribute of admiration to her virtues, and acknowledged to himself his\r\nown passionate love. It became a duty, in his eyes, to respect, revere,\r\nadore one so generous and noble. He was proud of the selection his heart\r\nhad made, and of his constancy. \"My own Cornelia,\" such was his reverie,\r\n\"how express your merit and the admiration it deserves!--other people\r\ntalk of generosity, and friendship, and parental affection--but you\r\nmanifest a visible image of these things; and while others theorize, you\r\nembody in your actions all that can be imagined of glorious and\r\nangelic.\" He congratulated himself on being able to return to the\r\ngenuine sentiments of his heart, and in finding reality give sanction to\r\nthe idolatry of his soul.\r\n\r\nHe longed to pour out his feelings at her feet, and to plead the cause\r\nof his fidelity and affection, to read in her eyes whether she would see\r\na reward for her sufferings in his attachment. Where was she, to receive\r\nhis protestations and vows? He half forgot, in the fervour of his\r\nfeelings, that he knew not whither she had retreated, nor possessed any\r\nclue whereby to find her. He returned to Mr. Gayland to inquire from\r\nhim; but he could tell nothing; he went to her house and questioned the\r\nservants, they remembered nothings; at last he found her maid, and\r\nlearnt from her, where she was accustomed to hire her post-horses; this\r\nwas all the information at which he could arrive.\r\n\r\nGoing to Newman's, with some difficulty he found the post-boy, who\r\nremembered driving her. By his means he traced her to Reading, but here\r\nall clue was lost. The inn to which she had gone had passed into other\r\nhands, and no one knew any thing about the arrivals and departures of\r\nthe preceding summer. He made various perquisitions, and lighted by\r\nchance on the servant she had taken with her to Reading, and there\r\ndismissed. From what he said, and a variety of other circumstances, he\r\nbecame convinced that she had gone abroad. He searched the foreign\r\npassport-office, and found that one had been taken out at the French\r\nAmbassador's in the month of April, by a Mrs. Fitzhenry. He persuaded\r\nhimself that this was proof that she had gone to Paris. It was most\r\nprobable that, impoverished as she was, and desirous of concealing her\r\naltered situation, that she should, as Lodore had formerly done, dismiss a\r\ntitle which would at once encumber and betray her. He immediately\r\nresolved to cross to France. And yet for a moment he hesitated, and\r\nreflected on what it was best to do.\r\n\r\nHe had given no intimation of his proceedings to his cousin, and they\r\nwere unaware that his journey was connected with Lady Lodore. He had a\r\nlover's wish to find her himself--himself to be the only source of\r\nconsolation--the only mediator to restore her to her daughter and to\r\nhappiness. But his fruitless attempts at discovery made him see that his\r\nwishes were not to be effected easily. He felt that he ought to\r\ncommunicate all he knew to his cousins, and even to ensure their\r\nassistance in his researches. Before going abroad, therefore, he\r\nreturned to Maristow Castle.\r\n\r\nHe arrived late in the evening. Lord Maristow and his daughters were\r\ngone out to dinner. The three persons whom Saville especially wished to\r\nsee, alone occupied the drawing-room. Edward was writing to his father,\r\nwho had advised him, now that he had a son, entirely to cut off the\r\nentail and mortgage a great part of the property: it was a distasteful\r\ntask to answer the suggestions of unprincipled selfishness. While he was\r\nthus occupied, Ethel had taken from her desk her mother's last letter,\r\nand was reading it again and again, weighing every syllable, and\r\nendeavouring to discover a hidden meaning. She went over to the sofa on\r\nwhich Fanny was sitting, to communicate to her a new idea that had\r\nstruck her. The studious girl had got into a corner with her Cicero, and\r\nwas reading the Tusculan Questions, which she readily laid aside to\r\nenter on a subject so deeply interesting. Saville opened the door, and\r\nappeared most unexpectedly among them. His manner was eager and abrupt,\r\nand the first words he uttered were, \"I am come to disturb you all, and\r\nto beg of you to return to London:--no time must be lost--can you go\r\nto-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Villiers, \"if you wish it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why?\" asked Ethel.\r\n\r\n\"You have found Lady Lodore!\" exclaimed Fanny.\r\n\r\n\"You are dreaming, Fanny,\" said Ethel; \"you see Horace shakes his head.\r\nBut if we go to-morrow, yet rest to-night. You are fatigued, pale, and\r\nill, Horace--you have been exerting yourself too much--explain your\r\nwishes, but take repose and refreshment.\"\r\n\r\nSaville was in too excited a state to think of either. He repelled\r\nEthel's feminine offers, till he had related his story. His listeners\r\nheard him with amazement. Villiers's cheeks glowed with shame, partly at\r\nthe injustice of his former conduct--partly at being the object of so\r\nmuch sacrifice and beneficence on the part of his mother-in-law. Fanny's\r\ncolour also heightened; she clasped her hands in delight, mingling\r\nvarious exclamations with Saville's story. \"Did I not say so? I was sure\r\nof it. If you had seen her when I did, on the day of her going away, you\r\nwould have been as certain as I.\" Ethel wept in silence, her heart was\r\ntouched to the core, \"the remorse of love\" awakened in it. How cold and\r\nungrateful had been all her actions: engrossed by her love for her\r\nhusband, she had bestowed no sympathy, made no demonstrations towards\r\nher mother. The false shame and Edward's oft-repeated arguments which\r\nhad kept her back, vanished from her mind. She reproached herself\r\nbitterly for lukewarmness and neglect; she yearned to show her\r\nrepentance--to seek forgiveness--to express, however feebly, her sense\r\nof her mother's angelic goodness. Her tears flowed to think of these\r\nthings, and that her mother was away, poor and alone, believing herself\r\nwronged in all their thoughts, resenting perhaps their unkindness,\r\nmourning over the ingratitude of her child.\r\n\r\nWhen the first burst of feeling was over, they discussed their future\r\nproceedings. Saville communicated his discoveries and his plan of\r\ncrossing to France. Villiers was as eager as his cousin to exert himself\r\nactively in the pursuit. His ingenuous and feeling mind was struck by\r\nhis injustice, and he was earnest in his wish to atone for the past, and\r\nto recompense her, if possible, for her sacrifices. As every one is apt\r\nto do with regard to the ideas of others, he was not satisfied with his\r\ncousin's efforts or conclusions; he thought more questions might be\r\nasked--more learnt at the inns on the route which Lady Lodore had taken.\r\nThe passport Saville had imagined to be hers, was taken out for Dover.\r\nReading was far removed from any road to Kent. They argued this. Horatio\r\nwas not convinced; but while he was bent on proceeding to Paris, Edward\r\nresolved to visit Reading--to examine the neighbourhood--to requestion\r\nthe servants--to put on foot a system of inquiry which must in the end\r\nassure them whether she was still in the kingdom. It was at once\r\nresolved, that on the morrow they should go to London.\r\n\r\nThither they accordingly went. They repaired to Lady Lodore's house.\r\nSaville on the next morning departed for France, and a letter soon reached\r\nthem from him, saying, that he felt persuaded that the Mrs. Fitzhenry was\r\nLady Lodore, and that he should pursue his way with all speed to Paris.\r\nIt appeared, that the lady in question had crossed to Calais on the\r\neleventh of June, and intimated her design of going to the Bagneres de\r\nBigorre among the Pyrennees, passing through Paris on her way. The\r\nmention of the Bagneres de Bigorre clinched Saville's suspicions--it was\r\nsuch a place as one in Lady Lodore's position might select for her\r\nabode--distant, secluded, situated in sublime and beautiful scenery,\r\nsingularly cheap, and seldom visited by strangers; yet the annual resort\r\nof the French from Bordeaux and Lyons, civilized what otherwise had been\r\ntoo rude and wild for an English lady. It was a long journey\r\nthither--the less wonder that nothing was heard, or seen, or surmised\r\nconcerning the absentee by her numerous acquaintances, many of whom were\r\nscattered on the continent. Saville represented all these things, and\r\nexpressed his conviction that he should find her. His letter was brief,\r\nfor he was hurried, and he felt that it were better to say nothing than\r\nto express imperfectly the conflicting emotions alive in his heart. \"My\r\nlife seems a dream,\" he said at the conclusion of his letter; \"a long\r\npainful dream, since last I saw her. I awake, she is not here; I go to\r\nseek her--my actions have that single scope--my thoughts tend to that\r\naim only; I go to find her--to restore her to Ethel. If I succeed in\r\nbestowing this happiness on her, I shall have my reward, and, whatever\r\nhappens, no selfish regret shall tarnish my delight.\"\r\n\r\nHe urged Villiers, meanwhile, not to rely too entirely on the conviction\r\nso strong in himself, but to pursue his plan of discovery with vigour.\r\nVilliers needed no spur. His eagerness was fully alive; he could not\r\nrest till he had rescued his mother-in-law from solitude and obscurity.\r\nHe visited Reading; he extended his inquiries to Newbury: here more\r\nlight broke in on his researches. He heard of Lady Lodore's illness--of her\r\nhaving resided for several months at a villa in the neighbourhood, while\r\nslowly recovering from a fever by which for a long time her life had\r\nbeen endangered. He heard also of her departure, her return to London.\r\nThen again all was obscurity. The innkeepers and letters of post-horses\r\nin London, were all visited in vain--the mystery became as impenetrable\r\nas ever. It seemed most probable that she was living in some obscure\r\npart of the metropolis--Ethel's heart sunk within her at the thought.\r\n\r\nEdward wrote to Saville to communicate this intelligence, which put an\r\nend to the idea of her being in France--but he was already gone on to\r\nBagneres. He himself perambulated London and its outskirts, but all in\r\nvain. The very thought that she should be residing in a place so sad,\r\nnay, so humiliating, without one gilding circumstance to solace poverty\r\nand obscurity, was unspeakably painful both to Villiers and his wife.\r\nEthel thought of her own abode in Duke street during her husband's\r\nabsence, and how miserable and forlorn it had been--she now wept\r\nbitterly over her mother's fate; even Fanny's philosophy could not\r\nafford consolation for these ideas.\r\n\r\nAn accident, however, gave a new turn to their conjectures. In the draw\r\nof a work-table, Ethel found an advertisement cut out of a newspaper,\r\nsetting forth the merits of a cottage to be let near Rhaiyder Gowy in\r\nRadnorshire, and with this, a letter from the agent at Rhaiyder, dated\r\nthe 13th of May, in answer to inquiries concerning the rent and\r\nparticulars. The letter intimated, that if the account gave\r\nsatisfaction, the writer would get the cottage prepared for the tenant\r\nimmediately, and the lady might take possession at the time mentioned,\r\non the 1st of June. The day after finding this letter, Villiers set out\r\nfor Wales.\r\n\r\nBut first he persuaded Ethel to spend the interval of his absence at\r\nLongfield. She had lately fretted much concerning her mother, and as she\r\nwas still nursing her baby, Edward became uneasy at her pale cheeks and\r\nthinness. Ethel was anxious to preserve her health for her child; she\r\nfelt that her uneasiness and pining would be lessened by a removal into\r\nthe country. She was useless in London, and there was something in her\r\nresidence in her mother's house--in the aspect of the streets--in the\r\nmemory of what she had suffered there, and the fear that Lady Lodore was\r\nenduring a worse repetition of the same evils, that agitated and preyed\r\nupon her. Her aunt had pressed her very much to come and see her, and\r\nshe wrote to say, that she might be expected on the following day. She\r\nbade adieu to Villiers with more of hope with regard to his success than\r\nshe had formerly felt. She became half convinced that her mother was not\r\nin London. Fanny supported her in these ideas; they talked continually\r\nof all they knew--of the illness of Lady Lodore--of her firmness of\r\npurpose in not sending for her daughter, or altering her plans in\r\nconsequence; they comforted themselves that the air of Wales would\r\nrestore her health, and the beauty of the scenery and the freedom of\r\nnature sooth her mind. They were full of hope--of more--of expectation.\r\nEthel, indeed, had at one time proposed accompanying her husband, but\r\nshe yielded to his entreaties, and to the fear suggested, that she might\r\ninjure her child's health. Villiers's motions would be more prompt\r\nwithout her. They separated. Ethel wrote to Saville a letter to find him\r\nat Paris, containing an account of their new discoveries, and then\r\nprepared for her journey to Essex with Fanny, her baby, and the\r\nbeautiful little Clorinda Saville, who had been left under her care, on\r\nthe following day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not One who much or oft delights\r\nTo season my Friends with personal talk,--\r\nOf Friends who live within an easy walk,\r\nOr Neighbours, daily, weekly in my sight.\r\nAnd, for my chance acquaintance, Ladies bright.\r\nSons, Mothers, Maidens withering on the stalk,\r\nThese all wear out of me, like Forms, with chalk\r\nPainted on rich men's floors, for one feast-night.\r\n\r\nWORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry returned to Longfield from Maristow Castle at\r\nthe end of the month of November. She gladly came back, in all the\r\ndinginess and bleakness of that dismal season, to her beloved seclusion\r\nat Longfield. The weather was dreary, a black frost invested every thing\r\nwith its icy chains, the landscape looked disconsolate, and now and then\r\nwintry blasts brought on snow-storms, and howled loudly through the long\r\ndark nights. The amiable spinster drew her chair close to the fire; with\r\nhalf-shut eyes she contemplated the glowing embers, and recalled many past\r\nwinters just like this, when Lodore was alive and in America; or, diving\r\nyet deeper into memory, when the honoured chair she now occupied, had\r\nbeen dignified by her father, and she had tried to sooth his querulous\r\ncomplaints on the continued absence of her brother Henry. When, instead\r\nof these familiar thoughts, the novel ones of Ethel and Villiers\r\nintruded themselves, she rubbed her eyes to be quite sure that she did\r\nnot dream. It was a lamentable change; and who the cause? Even she whose\r\nabsence had been, she felt, wickedly lamented at Maristow Castle,\r\nCornelia Santerre--she, who in an evil hour, had become Lady Lodore, and\r\nwho would before God, answer for the disasters and untimely death of her\r\nill-fated husband.\r\n\r\nWith any but Mrs. Fitzhenry, such accusations had, after the softening\r\nprocess of time, been changed to an admission, that, despite her errors,\r\nLady Lodore had rather been misled and mistaken, than heinously faulty; and\r\nher last act, in sacrificing so much to her daughter, although the extent\r\nof her sacrifice was unknown to her sister-in-law, had cancelled her former\r\ndelinquencies. But the prejudiced old lady was not so easily mollified;\r\nshe was harsh alone towards her, but all the gall of her nature was\r\ncollected and expended on the head of her brother's widow. Probably an\r\ninstinctive feeling of her unreasonableness made her more violent. Her\r\nlanguage was bitter whenever she alluded to her--she rejoiced at her\r\nabsence, and instead of entering into Ethel's gratitude and impatience,\r\nshe fervently prayed that she might never appear on the scene again.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry was less of a gossip than any maiden lady who\r\nhad ever lived singly in the centre of a little village. Her heart was\r\nfull of the dead and the absent--of past events, and their long train of\r\nconsequences, so that the history of the inhabitants of her village,\r\npossessed no charm for her. If any one among them suffered from\r\nmisfortune she endeavoured to relieve them, and if any died, she lamented,\r\nmoralized on the passage of time, and talked of Lodore's death; but\r\nthe scandal, the marriages, the feuds, and wonderful things that came to\r\npass at Longfield, appeared childish and contemptible, the flickering of\r\nearth-born tapers compared to the splendour, the obscuration, and final\r\nsetting of the celestial luminary which had been the pole-star of her\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIt was from this reason that Mrs. Fitzhenry had not heard of the Lady\r\nwho lodged at Dame Nixon's cottage, in the Vale of Bewling, till the\r\ntime, when, after having exhausted the curiosity of Longfield, she was\r\nalmost forgotten. The Lady, she was known by no other name, had arrived\r\nin the town during Mrs. Fitzhenry's visit to Maristow castle. She had\r\narrived in her own chariot, unattended by any servant; the following day\r\nshe had taken up her abode at Dame Nixon's cottage, saying, that she was\r\nonly going to stay a week: she had continued there for more than three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nDame Nixon's cottage was situated about a mile and a half from\r\nLongfield. It stood alone in a little hollow embowered by trees; the\r\nground behind rose to a slight upland, and a rill trickled through the\r\ngarden. You got to it by a bye path, which no wheeled vehicle could\r\ntraverse, though a horse might, and it was indeed the very dingle and\r\ncottage which Ethel had praised during her visit into Essex in the\r\npreceding year. The silence and seclusion were in summer tranquillizing\r\nand beautiful; in winter sad and drear; the fields were swampy in wet\r\nweather, and in snow and frost it seemed cut off from the rest of the\r\nworld. Dame Nixon and her granddaughter lived there alone. The girl had\r\nbeen engaged to be married. Her lover jilted her, and wedded a richer\r\nbride. The story is so old, that it is to be wondered that women have\r\nnot ceased to lament so common an occurrence. Poor Margaret was, on the\r\ncontrary, struck to the heart--she despised herself for being unable to\r\npreserve her lover's affections, rather than the deceiver for his\r\ninfidelity. She neglected her personal appearance, nor ever showed\r\nherself among her former companions, except to support her grandmother\r\nto church. Her false lover sat in the adjoining pew. She fixed her eyes\r\non her Prayer-book during the service, and on the ground as she went\r\naway. She did not wish him to see the change which his faithlessness had\r\nwrought, for surely it would afflict him. Once there had not bloomed a\r\nfresher or gayer rose in the fields of Essex--now she had grown thin and\r\npale--her young light step had become slow and heavy--sickness and\r\nsorrow made her eyes hollow, and her cheeks sunken. She avoided every\r\none, devoting herself to attendance on her grandmother. Dame Nixon was\r\nnearly doting. Life was ebbing fast from her old frame; her best\r\npleasure was to sun herself in the garden in summer, or to bask before\r\nthe winter's fire. While enjoying these delights, her dimmed eyes\r\nbrightened, and a smile wreathed her withered lips; she said, \"Ah! this\r\nis comfortable;\" while her broken-hearted grandchild envied a state of\r\nbeing which could content itself with mere animal enjoyment. They were\r\nvery poor. Margaret had to work hard; but the thoughts of the head, or,\r\nat least, the feelings of the heart, need not wait on the labour of the\r\nhands. The Sunday visit to church kept alive her pain; her very prayers\r\nwere bitter, breathed close to the deceiver and her who had usurped her\r\nhappiness: the memory and anticipation haunted her through the week; she\r\nwas often blinded by tears as she patiently pursued her household\r\nduties, or her toil in their little garden. Her hands were hardened with\r\nwork, her throat, her face sunburnt; but exercise and occupation did not\r\nprevent her from wasting away, or her cheek from becoming sunk and wan.\r\n\r\nDame Nixon's cottage was poor but roomy; some years before, a gentleman\r\nfrom London had, in a freak, hired two rooms in it, and furnished them.\r\nSince then, she had sometimes let them, and now they were occupied by\r\nthe stranger lady. At first all three of the inhabitants appeared each\r\nSunday at church. The Lady was dressed in spotless and simple white, and\r\nso closely veiled, that no one could see her face; of course she was\r\nbeautiful. Soon after Mrs. Elizabeth's return from Maristow Castle, it\r\nwas discovered that first the lady stayed away, and soon, that the whole\r\nparty absented themselves on Sunday; and as this defalcation demanded\r\ninquiry, it was discovered that a pony chaise took them three miles off\r\nto the church of the nearest village. This was a singular and yet a\r\nbeneficial change. The false swain must rejoice at losing sight of the\r\nmemento of his sin, and Margaret would certainly pray with a freer\r\nheart, when she no longer shrunk from his gaze and that of his wife.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the end of January that Mrs. Elizabeth heard of the\r\nLady; it was not till the beginning of February that she asked a single\r\nquestion about her.\r\n\r\nIn January, passing the inn-yard, the curate's wife, who was walking\r\nwith her, said, \"There is the chariot belonging to the Lady who lodges\r\nat dame Nixon's cottage. I wonder who she is. The arms are painted out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, dame Nixon has a lodger then; that is a good thing, it will help\r\nher through the winter. I have not seen her or her daughter at church\r\nlately.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the other, \"they go now to Bewling church.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to hear it,\" said Mrs. Fitzhenry; \"it is much better for poor\r\nMargaret not to come here.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation went on, and the Lady was alluded to, but no questions\r\nwere asked or curiosity excited. In February she heard from the doctor's\r\nwife, that the doctor had been to the cottage, and that the Lady was\r\nindisposed. She heard at the same time that this Lady had refused to\r\nreceive the visits of the curate's lady and the doctor's lady--excusing\r\nherself, that she was going to leave Essex immediately. This had\r\nhappened two months before. On hearing of her illness, Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nthought of calling on her, but this stopped her. \"It is very odd,\" said\r\nthe doctor's wife, \"she came in her own carriage, and yet has no\r\nservants. She lives in as poor a way as can be, down in that cottage,\r\nyet my husband says she is more like the Queen of England in her looks\r\nand ways than any one he ever saw.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like the Queen of England?\" said Mrs. Fitzhenry, \"What queen?--Queen\r\nCharlotte?\" who had been the queen of the greater part of the good\r\nlady's life.\r\n\r\n\"She is as young and beautiful as an angel,\" said the other, half angry;\r\n\"it is very mysterious. She did not look downcast like, as if any thing\r\nwas wrong, but was as cheerful and condescending as could be.\r\n'Condescending, Doctor,' said I, for my husband used the word; 'you\r\ndon't want condescension from a poor body lodging at dame Nixon's.'--'A\r\npoor body!' said he, in a huff, 'she is more of a lady, indeed more like\r\nthe Queen of England than any rich body you ever saw.' And what is odd,\r\nno one knows her name--Dame Nixon and Margaret always call her Lady--the\r\nvery marks are picked out from her pocket handkerchiefs. Yet I did hear\r\nthat there was a coronet plain to be seen on one--a thing impossible\r\nunless she was a poor cast-away; and the doctor says he'd lay his life\r\nthat she was nothing of that. He must know her name when he makes out\r\nher bill, and I told him to ask it plump, but he puts off, and puts off,\r\ntill I am out of all patience.\"\r\n\r\nA misty confused sense of discomfort stole over Mrs. Elizabeth when she\r\nheard of the coronet in the corner of the pocket handkerchief, but it\r\npassed away without suggesting any distinct idea to her mind. Nor did\r\nshe feel curiosity about the stranger--she was too much accustomed to\r\nthe astonishment, the conjectures, the gossip of Longfield, to suppose\r\nthat there was any real foundation for surprise, because its\r\nwonder-loving inhabitants choose to build up a mystery out of every\r\ncommon occurrence of life.\r\n\r\nThis absence of inquisitiveness must long have kept Mrs. Fitzhenry in\r\nignorance of who her neighbour was, and the inhabitants of Longfield\r\nwould probably have discovered it before her, had not the truth been\r\nrevealed even before she entertained a suspicion that there was any\r\nsecret to be found out.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, ma'am,\" said her maid to her one evening, as she was\r\nsuperintending the couch\u00e9e of the worthy spinster, \"I think you ought\r\nto know, though I am afraid you may be angry.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman hesitated; her mistress encouraged her. \"If it is any thing I\r\nought to know, Wilmot, tell it at once, and don't be afraid. What has\r\nhappened to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"To me, ma'am,--la! nothing,\" replied the maid; \"it's something about\r\nthe Lady at dame Nixon's, only you commanded me never to speak the name\r\nof----\"\r\n\r\nAnd again the good woman stopped short. Mrs. Fitzhenry, a little\r\nsurprised, and somewhat angry, bade her go on. At length, in plain words\r\nshe was told:\r\n\r\n\"Why, ma'am, the Lady down in the Vale is no other than my lady--than\r\nLady Lodore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ridiculous--who told you so?\"\r\n\r\n\"My own eyes, ma'am; I shouldn't have believed any thing else. I saw the\r\nLady, and it was my Lady, as sure as I stand here.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how could you know her? it is years since you saw her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" said the woman, with a smile of superiority; \"but it is\r\nnot easy to forget Lady Lodore. See her yourself, ma'am,--you will know\r\nthen that I am right.\"\r\n\r\nWilmot had lived twenty years with Mrs. Fitzhenry. She had visited town\r\nwith her at the time of Ethel's christening. She had been kept in\r\nvexatious ignorance of subsequent events, till the period of the visit\r\nof her mistress and niece to London two years before, when she\r\nindemnified herself. Through the servants of Villiers, and of the Misses\r\nSaville, she had learnt a vast deal; and not satisfied with mere\r\nhearsay, she had seen Lady Lodore several times getting into her carriage\r\nat her own door, and had even been into her house: such energy is there in\r\na liberal curiosity. The same disinterested feeling had caused her to go\r\ndown to dame Nixon's with an offer from her mistress of service to the\r\nLady, hearing she was ill. She went perfectly unsuspicious of the\r\nwonderful discovery she was about to make, and was thus rewarded beyond\r\nher most sanguine hopes, by being in possession of a secret, known to\r\nherself alone. The keeping of a secret is, however, a post of no honour\r\nif all knowledge be confined to the possessor alone. Mrs. Wilmot was\r\ntolerably faithful, with all her love of knowledge; she was sure it\r\nwould vex her mistress if Lady Lodore's strange place of abode were\r\nknown at Longfield, and Mrs. Fitzhenry was consequently the first person\r\nto whom she had hinted the fact. All this account she detailed with\r\ngreat volubility. Her mistress recommended discretion most earnestly;\r\nand at the same time expressed a doubt whether her information was\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would go and judge for yourself, ma'am,\" said the maid.\r\n\r\n\"God forbid!\" exclaimed Mrs. Fitzhenry. \"God grant I never see Lady\r\nLodore again! She will go soon. You tell me that dame Nixon says she is\r\nonly staying till she is well. She will go soon, and it need never be\r\nknown, except to ourselves, Wilmot, that she was ever here.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a dignity in this eternal mystery that somewhat compensated\r\nfor the absence of wonder and fuss which the woman had anticipated with\r\nintense pleasure. She assured her mistress, over and over again, of her\r\nsecrecy and discretion, and was dismissed with the exhortation to forget\r\nall she had learnt as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore did she come here? what can she be doing?\" Mrs. Fitzhenry\r\nasked herself over and over again. She could not guess. It was strange,\r\nit was mysterious, and some mischief was at the bottom--but she would go\r\nsoon--\"would that she were already gone!\"\r\n\r\nIt must be mentioned that Mrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry had left Maristow\r\nCastle before the arrival of Mr. Gayland, and had therefore no knowledge\r\nof the still more mysterious cloud that enveloped Lady Lodore's absence.\r\nIgnorant of her self-destroying sacrifices and generosity, her pity was\r\nnot excited, her feelings were all against her. She counted the days as\r\nthey passed, and looked wistfully at Wilmot, hoping that she would\r\nquickly bring tidings of the Lady's departure. In vain; the doctor\r\nceased to visit the cottage, but the Lady remained. All at once the\r\ndoctor visited it again with greater assiduity than ever--not on account\r\nof his beautiful patient--but Dame Nixon had had a paralytic stroke, and\r\nthe kind Lady had sent for him, and promised to defray all the expenses\r\nof the poor woman's illness.\r\n\r\nAll this was truly vexatious. Mrs. Fitzhenry fretted, and even asked\r\nWilmot questions, but the unwelcome visitor was still there. Wherefore?\r\nWhat could have put so disagreeable a whim into her head? The good lady\r\ncould think of no motive, while she considered her presence an insult.\r\nShe was still more annoyed when she received a letter from Ethel. It had\r\nbeen proposed that Mr. and Mrs. Villiers should pay her a visit in the\r\nspring; but now Ethel wrote to say that she might be immediately\r\nexpected. \"I have strange things to tell you about my dear mother,\"\r\nwrote Ethel; \"it is very uncertain where she is. Horatio can hear\r\nnothing of her at Paris, and will soon return. Edward is going to Wales,\r\nas there seems a great likelihood that she has secluded herself there.\r\nWhile he is away you may expect me. I shall not be able to stay long--he\r\nwill come at the end of a week to fetch me.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Fitzhenry shuddered. Her prejudices were stronger than ever. She\r\nexperienced the utmost wretchedness from the idea that the residence of\r\nLady Lodore would be discovered, and a family union effected. It seemed\r\ndesecration to the memory of her brother, ruin to Ethel--the greatest\r\nmisfortune that could befal any of them. Her feelings were exaggerated,\r\nbut they were on that account the more powerful. How could she avert the\r\nevil?--a remedy must be sought, and she fixed on one--a desperate one,\r\nin truth, which appeared to her the sole mode of saving them all from\r\nthe greatest disasters.\r\n\r\nShe resolved to visit Lady Lodore; to represent to her the impropriety and\r\nwickedness of her having any intercourse with her daughter, and to\r\nentreat her to depart before Ethel's arrival. Her violence might almost\r\nseem madness; but all people who live in solitude become to a certain\r\ndegree insane. Their views of things are not corrected by comparing them\r\nwith those of others; and the strangest want of proportion always reigns\r\nin their ideas and sentiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nSo loth we part from all we love,\r\nFrom all the links that bind us;\r\nSo turn our hearts, where'er we rove,\r\nTo those we've left behind us.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Mrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry drove to the Vale of\r\nBewling. It was the last day of February. The March winds were hushed as\r\nyet; the breezes were balmy, the sunshine cheerful; a few soft clouds\r\nflecked the heavens, and the blue sky appeared between them calm and\r\npure. Each passing air breathed life and happiness--it caressed the\r\ncheek--and the swelling buds of the trees felt its quickening influence.\r\nThe almond-trees were in bloom--the pear blossoms began to whiten--the\r\ntender green of the young leaves showed themselves here and there among\r\nthe hedges. The old lady felt the cheering influence, and would have\r\nbecome even gay, had not the idea of the errand she was on checked her\r\nspirits. Sometimes the remembrance that she was really going to see her\r\nsister-in-law absolutely startled her; once or twice she thought of\r\nturning back; she passed through the lanes, and then alighting from her\r\ncarriage, walked by a raised foot-way, across some arable fields--and\r\nagain through a little grove; the winding path made a turn, and dame\r\nNixon's white, low-roofed cottage was before her. Every thing about it\r\nlooked trim, but very humble: and it was unadorned during this early\r\nseason by the luxury of flowers and plants, which usually give even an\r\nappearance of elegance to an English cottage. Mrs. Fitzhenry opened the\r\nlittle gate--her knees trembled as she walked through the scanty garden,\r\nwhich breathed of the new-sprung violets. The entrance to the cottage\r\nwas by the kitchen: she entered this, and found Margaret occupied by a\r\nculinary preparation for her grandmother. Mrs. Fitzhenry asked after the\r\nold woman's health, and thus gained a little time. Margaret answered in\r\nher own former quiet yet cheerful voice; she was changed from what she\r\nhad been a few weeks before. The bloom had not returned to her cheeks,\r\nbut they no longer appeared streaked with deathly paleness; her motions\r\nhad lost the heaviness that showed a mind ill at ease. Mrs. Elizabeth\r\ncongratulated her on the restoration of her health.\r\n\r\n\"O yes,\" she replied, with a blush, \"I am not the same creature I used\r\nto be, thank God, and the angel he has sent us here;--if my poor\r\ngrandmother would but get well I should be quite happy; but that is\r\nasking too much at her time of life.\"\r\n\r\nThe old lady made no further observations: she did not wish to hear the\r\npraises of her sister-in-law. \"Your lodger is still here?\" at length she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, God be praised!\" replied Margaret.\r\n\r\n\"Will you give her my compliments, and say I am here, and that I wish to\r\nsee her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" said Margaret; \"only the lady has refused to see any one,\r\nand she does not like being asked.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish to be impertinent or intrusive,\" answered Mrs. Elizabeth;\r\n\"only tell her my name, and if she makes any objection, of course she\r\nwill do as she likes. Where is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is sitting with my poor grandmother; the nurse--Heaven bless her!\r\nshe would hire a nurse, to spare me, as she said--is lain down to sleep,\r\nand she said she would watch by grandmother while I got the gruel; but\r\nit's ready now, and I will go and tell her.\"\r\n\r\nAway tripped Margaret, leaving her guest lost in wonder. Lady Lodore\r\nwatching the sick-bed of an old cottager--Lady Lodore immured in a\r\npoverty-stricken abode, fit only for the poorer sort of country people.\r\nIt was more than strange, it was miraculous. \"Yet she refused to\r\naccompany poor Henry to America! there must be some strange mystery in\r\nall this, that does not tell well for her.\"\r\n\r\nSo bitterly uncharitable was the unforgiving old lady towards her\r\nbrother's widow. She ruminated on these things for a minute or two, and\r\nthen Margaret came to usher her into the wicked one's presence. The\r\nsitting-room destined for the lodger was neat, though very plain. The\r\nwalls were wainscotted and painted white,--the windows small and\r\nlatticed,--the furniture was old black, shining mahogany; the chairs\r\nhigh-backed and clumsy; the table heavy and incommodious; the fire-place\r\nlarge and airy; and the shelf of the mantel-piece almost as high as the\r\nlow ceiling: there were a few things of a more modern construction; a\r\ncomfortable sofa, a rose-wood bureau and large folding screen; near the\r\nfire was a large easy chair of Gillows's manufacture, two light cane\r\nones, and two small tables; vases filled with hyacinths, jonquils, and\r\nother spring flowers stood on one, and an embroidery frame occupied the\r\nother. There was a perfume of fresh-gathered flowers in the room, which\r\nthe open window rendered very agreeable. Lady Lodore was standing near the\r\nfire--(for Wilmot was not mistaken, and it was she indeed who now\r\npresented herself to Mrs. Fitzhenry's eyes)--she might be agitated--she\r\ndid not show it--she came forward and held out her hand. \"Dear Bessy,\"\r\nshe said, \"you are very kind to visit me; I thank you very much.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor recluse was overpowered. The cordiality of the greeting\r\nfrightened her: she who had come full of bitter reproach and hard\r\npurposes, to be thanked with that sweet voice and smile. \"I thought,\" at\r\nlength she stammered out, \"that you did not wish to be known. I am glad\r\nyou are not offended, Cornelia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Offended by kindness? O no! It is true I did not wish--I do not wish\r\nthat it should be known that I am here--but since, by some strange\r\naccident, you have discovered me, how can I help being grateful for your\r\nvisit? I am indeed glad to see you; it is so long since I have heard any\r\nthing. Ah! dear Bessy, tell me, how is Ethel?\"\r\n\r\nTears glistened in the mother's eyes: she asked many questions, and Mrs.\r\nFitzhenry a little recovered her self-possession, as she answered them.\r\nShe looked at Lady Lodore--she was changed--she could not fail of being\r\nchanged after so many years,--she was no longer a beautiful girl, but\r\nshe was a lovely woman. Despite the traces of years, which however\r\nlightly they impressed, yet might be discerned; expression so\r\nembellished her that it was impossible not to admire; brilliancy had\r\ngiven place to softness, animation to serenity; still she was\r\nfair--still her silken hair clustered on her brow, and her sweet eyes\r\nwere full of fire; her smile had more than its former charm--it came\r\nfrom the heart.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fitzhenry was not, however, to be subdued by a little outward show.\r\nShe was there, who had betrayed and deserted (such were the energetic\r\nwords she was accustomed to employ) the noble, broken-hearted Lodore. The\r\nthought steeled her purpose, and she contrived at last to ask whether\r\nLady Lodore was going to remain much longer in Essex?\r\n\r\n\"I have been going every day since I came here. In a few weeks I shall\r\ncertainly be gone. Why do you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I thought--that is--you have made a secret of your being here,\r\nand I expect Ethel in a day or two, and she would certainly discover\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should she not?\" asked Lady Lodore. \"Why should you be averse to my\r\nseeing Ethel?\"\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to say a disagreeable thing, especially to one\r\nunaccustomed to society, and who is quite ignorant of the art of\r\nconcealing the sting of her intentions by flowery words. Mrs. Fitzhenry\r\nsaid something about her sister-in-law's own wishes, and the desire\r\nexpressed by Lodore that there should be no intercourse between the mother\r\nand daughter.\r\n\r\nCornelia's eyes flashed fire--\"Am I,\" she exclaimed, \"to be always the\r\nsacrifice? Is my husband's vengeance to pursue me beyond his grave--even\r\ntill I reach mine? Unjust as he was, he would not have desired this.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth coloured with anger. Lady Lodore continued--\"Pardon me,\r\nBessy, I do not wish to say any thing annoying to you or in blame of\r\nLodore. God knows I did him great wrong--but--\"\r\n\r\n\"O Cornelia,\" cried the old lady, \"do you indeed acknowledge that you\r\nwere to blame?\"\r\n\r\nLady Lodore smiled, and said, \"I were strangely blind to the defects of my\r\nown character, and to the consequences of my actions, were I not conscious\r\nof my errors; but retrospection is useless, and the punishment has\r\nbeen--is--sufficiently severe. Lodore himself would not have perpetuated\r\nhis resentment, had he lived only a very little while longer. But I will\r\nspeak frankly to you, Bessy, as frankly as I may, and you shall decide\r\non my further stay here. From circumstances which it is immaterial to\r\nexplain, I have resolved on retiring into absolute solitude. I shall\r\nnever live in London again--never again see any of my old friends and\r\nacquaintances. The course of my life is entirely changed; and whether I\r\nlive here or elsewhere, I shall live in obscurity and poverty. I do not\r\nwish Ethel to know this. She would wish to assist me, and she has\r\nscarcely enough for herself. I do not like being a burthen--I do not\r\nlike being pitied--I do not like being argued with, or to have my\r\nactions commented upon. You know that my disposition was always\r\nindependent.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth assented with a sigh, casting up her eyes to heaven.\r\n\r\nLady Lodore smiled, and went on. \"You think this is a strange place for me\r\nto live in: whether here or elsewhere, I shall never live in any better: I\r\nshall be fortunate if I find myself as well off when I leave Essex, for\r\nthe people here are good and honest, and the poor girl loves me,--it is\r\nalways pleasant to be loved.\"\r\n\r\nA tear again filled Cornelia's eyes--she tried to animate herself to\r\nsmile. \"I have nothing to love in all the wide world except Ethel; I do\r\nlove her; every one must love her--she is so gentle--so kind--so\r\nwarm-hearted and beautiful,--I love her more than my own heart's blood;\r\nshe is my child--part of that blood--part of myself--the better part; I\r\nhave seen little of her, but every look and word is engraved on my\r\nheart. I love her voice--her smiles--the pressure of her soft white\r\nhand. Pity me, dear Bessy, I am never to see any of these, which are all\r\nthat I love on earth, again. This idea fills me with regret--with\r\nworse--with sorrow. There is a grave not far from here which contains\r\none you loved beyond all others,--what would you not give to see him\r\nalive once again? To visit his tomb is a consolation to you. I must not\r\nseen even the walls within which my blessed child lives. You alone can\r\nhelp me--can be of comfort to me. Do not refuse--do not send me away. If\r\nI leave this place, I shall go to some secluded nook in Wales, and be\r\nquite--quite alone; the sun will shine, and the grass will grow at my\r\nfeet, but my heart will be dead within me, and I shall pine and die. I\r\nhave intended to do this; I have waited only till the sufferings of the\r\npoor woman here should be at an end, that I may be of service to\r\nMargaret, and then go. Your visit, which I fancied meant in kindness,\r\nhas put other thoughts into my head.\r\n\r\n\"Do not object to my staying here; let me remain; and do yet more for\r\nme--come to me sometimes, and bring me tidings of my daughter--tell me\r\nwhat she says--how she looks,--tell me that she is at each moment well\r\nand happy. Ah! do this, dear Bessy, and I will bless you. I shall never\r\nsee her--at least not for years; there are many things to prevent it:\r\nyet how could I drag out those years quite estranged from her? My heart\r\nhas died within me each time I have thought of it. But I can live as I\r\nsay; I shall expect you every now and then to come and talk to me of\r\nher; she need never know that I am so near--she comes so seldom to\r\nEssex. I shall soon be forgotten at Longfield. Will you consent? you\r\nwill do a kind action, and God will bless you.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Fitzhenry was one of those persons who always find it difficult to\r\nsay, No; and Lady Lodore asked with so much earnestness that she commanded;\r\nshe felt that her request ought to be granted, and therefore it was\r\nimpossible to refuse it. Before she well knew what she had said, the\r\ngood lady had yielded her consent and received her sister-in-law's warm\r\nand heart-felt thanks.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fitzhenry looked round the room: \"But how can you think of staying\r\nhere, Cornelia?\" she said; \"this place is not fit for you. I should have\r\nthought that you could never have endured such homely rooms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think them so bad?\" replied the lady; \"I think them very\r\npleasant, for I have done with pride, and I find peace and comfort here.\r\nLook,\" she continued, throwing open a door that led into the garden, \"is\r\nnot that delightful? This garden is very pretty: that clear rivulet\r\nmurmurs by with so lulling a sound;--and look at these violets, are they\r\nnot beautiful? I have planted a great many flowers, and they will soon\r\ncome up. Do you not know how pleasant it is to watch the shrubs we\r\nplant, and water, and rear ourselves?--to see the little green shoots\r\npeep out, and the leaves unfold, and then the flower blossom and expand,\r\ndiffusing its delicious odour around,--all, as it were, created by\r\noneself, by one's own nursing, out of a bit of stick or an ugly bulb?\r\nThis place is very pretty, I assure you: when the leaves are on the\r\ntrees they make a bower, and the grove behind the house is shady, and\r\nleads to lanes and fields more beautiful than any I ever saw. I have\r\nloitered for hours in this garden, and been quite happy. Now I shall be\r\nhappier than ever, thanks to you. You will not forget me. Come as often\r\nas you can. You say that you expect Ethel soon?\"\r\n\r\nLady Ladore walked with her sister-in-law to the garden-gate, and\r\nbeyond, through the little copse, still talking of her daughter. \"I\r\ncannot go further,\" she said, at last, \"without a bonnet--so good-bye,\r\ndear Bessy. Come soon. Thank you--thank you for this visit.\"\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand: Mrs. Fitzhenry took it, pressed it, a half\r\nfeeling came over her as if she were about to kiss the check of her\r\noffending relative, but her heart hardened, she blushed, and muttering\r\na hasty good-bye, she hurried away. She was bewildered, and after\r\nwalking a few steps, she turned round, and saw again the white dress of\r\nCornelia, as a turn in the path hid her. The grand, the exclusive Lady\r\nLodore--the haughty, fashionable, worldly-heartless wife thus metamorphosed\r\ninto a tender-hearted mother--suing to her for crumbs of charitable\r\nlove--and hiding all her boasted advantages in that low-roofed cottage!\r\nWhat could it all mean?\r\n\r\nMrs. Fitzhenry walked on. Again she thought, \"How odd! I went there,\r\ndetermining to persuade her to go away, and miserable at the thoughts of\r\nseeing her only once; and now I have promised to visit her often, and\r\nagreed that she shall live here. Have I not done wrong? What would my\r\npoor brother say? Yet I could not refuse. Poor thing! how could I\r\nrefuse, when she said that she had nothing else to live for? Besides, to\r\ngo away and live alone in Wales--it would be too dreadful; and she\r\nthanked me as if she were so grateful. I hope I have not done wrong.\r\n\r\n\"But how strange it is that Henry's widow should have become so poor;\r\nshe has given up a part of her income to Ethel, but a great deal\r\nremains. What can she have done with it? She is mysterious, and there is\r\nnever any good in mystery. Who knows what she may have to conceal?\" Mrs.\r\nElizabeth got in her carriage, and each step of the horses took her\r\nfarther from the web of enchantment which Cornelia had thrown over her.\r\n\"She is always strange,\"--thus ran her meditations; \"and how am I to see\r\nher, and no one find it out? and what a story for Longfield, that Lady\r\nLodore should be living in poverty in dame Nixon's cottage. I forgot to\r\ntell her that--I forgot to say so many things I meant to say--I don't know\r\nwhy, except that she talked so much, and I did not know how to bring in\r\nmy objections. But it cannot be right: and Ethel in her long rambles and\r\nrides with Miss Derham or Mr. Villiers, will be sure to find her out. I\r\nwish I had not seen her--I will write and tell her I have changed my\r\nmind, and entreat her to go away.\"\r\n\r\nAs it occurs to all really good-natured persons, it was very\r\ndisagreeable to Mrs. Fitzhenry to be angry, and she visited the\r\nill-temper so engendered on the head of poor Cornelia. She disturbed\r\nherself by the idea of all the disagreeable things that might happen--of\r\nher sister-in-law's positive refusal to go; the very wording which she\r\nimagined for her intended letter puzzled and irritated her. She no\r\nlonger felt the breath of spring as pleasant, but sat back in the\r\nchariot, \"nursing her wrath to keep it warm.\" When she reached her home,\r\nEthel's carriage was at her door.\r\n\r\nThe meeting, as ever, between aunt and niece was affectionate. Fanny was\r\nwelcomed, the baby was kissed, and little Clorinda admired, but the\r\ntheme nearest Ethel's heart was speedily introduced--her mother. The\r\ndisquietudes she felt on her account--Mr. Saville's journey to\r\nParis--the visit of Villiers to Wales to discover her place of\r\nconcealment--the inutility of all their endeavours.\r\n\r\n\"But why are they so anxious?\" asked her aunt; \"I can understand you:\r\nyou have some fantastic notion about your mother, but how can Mr.\r\nVilliers desire so very much to find her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could almost say,\" said Ethel, \"that Edward is more eager than\r\nmyself, though I should wrong my own affection and gratitude; but he was\r\nmore unjust towards her, and thus he feels the weight of obligation more\r\nkeenly; but, perhaps, dear aunt, you do not know all that my dearest\r\nmother has done for us--the unparalleled sacrifices she has made.\"\r\n\r\nThen Ethel went on to tell her all that Mr. Gayland had\r\ncommunicated--the sale of her jointure--the very small residue of money\r\nshe had kept for herself--the entire payment of Villiers's debts--and\r\nafterwards the surrender of the remainder of her income and of her house\r\nto them. Her eyes glistened as she spoke; her heart, overflowing with\r\nadmiration and affection, shone in her beautiful face, her voice was\r\npregnant with sensibility, and her expressions full of deep feeling.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth's heart was not of stone--far from it; it was, except in\r\nthe one instance of her sister-in-law, made of pliable materials. She\r\nheard Ethel's story--she caught by sympathy the tenderness and pity she\r\npoured forth--she thought of Lady Lodore at the cottage, a dwelling so\r\nunlike any she had ever inhabited before--poverty-stricken and mean; she\r\nremembered her praises of it--her cheerfulness--the simplicity of taste\r\nwhich she displayed--the light-hearted content with which she spoke of\r\nevery privation except the absence of Ethel. What before was mysterious\r\nwrong, was now manifest heroism. The loftiness and generosity of her\r\nmind rose upon the old lady unclouded; her own uncharitable deductions\r\nstung her with remorse; she continued to listen, and Ethel to narrate,\r\nand the big tears gathered in her eyes, and rolled down her venerable\r\ncheeks,--tears at once of repentance and admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nRepentance is a tender sprite;\r\nIf aught on earth have heavenly might,\r\n'Tis lodged within her silent tear.\r\n\r\nWORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry was not herself aware of all that Lady Lodore had\r\nsuffered, or the extent of her sacrifices. She guessed darkly at them,\r\nbut it was the detail that rendered them so painful, and, but for their\r\nmotive, humiliating to one nursed in luxury, and accustomed to all those\r\nintermediate servitors and circumstances, which stand between the rich\r\nand the bare outside of the working-day world. Cornelia shrunk from the\r\naddress of those she did not know, and from the petty acts of daily\r\nlife, which had gone on before without her entering into their detail.\r\n\r\nHer illness at Newbury had been severe. She was attacked by the scarlet\r\nfever; the doctor had ordered her to be removed from the bustle of the\r\ninn, and a furnished villa had been taken for her, while she could only\r\ngive a languid assent to propositions which she understood confusedly.\r\nShe was a long time very ill--a long time weak and slowly convalescent.\r\nAt length health dawned on her, accompanied by a disposition attuned to\r\ncontent and a wish for tranquillity. Her residence was retired,\r\ncommodious, and pretty; she was pleased with it, she did not wish to\r\nremove, and was glad to procrastinate from day to day any consideration\r\nof the future. Thus it was a long time before the strength of her\r\nthoughts and purposes was renewed, or that she began to think seriously\r\nof where she was, and what she was going to do.\r\n\r\nDuring the half delirium, the disturbed and uncontrollable, but not\r\nunmeaning reveries, of her fever, the idea of visiting Lodore's grave had\r\nhaunted her pertinaciously. She had often dreamt of it: at one time the\r\ntomb seemed to rise in a lonely desert; and the dead slept peacefully\r\nbeneath sunshine or starlight. At another, storms and howling winds were\r\naround, groans and sighs, mingled with the sound of the tempest, and\r\nmenaces and reproaches against her were breathed from the cold marble.\r\nNow her imagination pictured it within the aisles of a magnificent\r\ncathedral; and now again the real scene--the rustic church of Longfield\r\nwas vividly present to her mind. She saw the pathway through the green\r\nchurchyard--the ruined ivy-mantled tower, which showed how much larger\r\nthe edifice had been in former days, near which might be still discerned\r\non high a niche containing the holy mother and divine child--the\r\nhalf-defaced porch on which rude monkish imagery was carved--the\r\ntime-worn pews, and painted window. She had never entered this church\r\nbut once, many, many years ago; and it was strange how in sleep and\r\nfever-troubled reverie, each portion of it presented itself distinctly\r\nand vividly to her imagination. During these perturbed visions, one\r\nother form and voice perpetually recurred. She heard Ethel continually\r\nrepeat, \"Come! come!\" and often her figure flitted round the tomb or sat\r\nbeside it. Once, on awakening from a dream, which impressed her deeply\r\nby the importunity and earnestness of her daughter's appeal, she was\r\nforcibly impelled to consider it her duty to obey, and she made a vow\r\nthat on recovering from her illness, she would visit her husband's\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nNow while pondering on the humiliations and cheerless necessities which\r\ndarkened her future, and rousing herself to form some kind of resolution\r\nconcerning them, this dream was repeated, and on awakening, the memory\r\nof her forgotten vow renewed itself in her. She dwelt on it with\r\npleasure. Here was something to be done that was not mere wretchedness\r\nand lonely wandering--something that, connecting her with the past, took\r\naway the sense of desertion and solitude, so hard to bear. In the\r\nmorning, at breakfast, it so chanced that she read in the Morning Herald\r\na little paragraph announcing that Viscount Maristow was entertaining a\r\nparty of friends at Maristow Castle, among whom were Mr. and Mrs.\r\nVilliers, and the Hon. Mrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry. This was a fortunate\r\ncoincidence. The dragon ceased for a moment to watch the garden, and she\r\nmight avail herself of its absence to visit its treasure unnoticed and\r\nunknown. She put her project into immediate execution. She crossed the\r\ncountry, passing through London on her way to Longfield--she arrived.\r\nWithout delay she fulfilled her purpose. She entered the church and\r\nviewed the tablet, inscribed simply with the name of Lodore, and the date\r\nof his birth and death. The words were few and common-place, but they were\r\neloquent to her. They told her that the cold decaying shape lay beneath,\r\nwhich in the pride of life and love had clasped her in its arms as its\r\nown for evermore. Short-lived had been the possession. She had loosened\r\nthe tie even while thought and feeling ruled the now insentient\r\nbrain--he had been scarcely less dead to her while inhabiting the\r\ndistant Illinois, than now that a stone placed above him, gave visible\r\ntoken of his material presence, and the eternal absence of his immortal\r\npart. Cornelia had never before felt so sensibly that she had been a\r\nwife neglecting her duties, despising a vow she had solemnly pledged,\r\nestranging herself from him, who by religious ordinance, and the laws of\r\nsociety, alone had privilege to protect and love her. Nor had she before\r\nfelt so intimately the change--that she was a widow; that her lover, her\r\nhusband, the father of her child, the forsaken, dead Lodore, was indeed\r\nno part of the tissue of life, action, and feeling to which she\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\nSolitude and sickness had before awakened many thoughts in her mind, and\r\nshe recalled them as she sat beside her dead husband's grave. She looked\r\ninto her motives, tried to understand the deceits she had practised on\r\nherself, and to purify her conscience. She meditated on time, that law\r\nof the world, which is so mysterious, and so potent; ruling us\r\ndespotically, and yet wholly unappreciated till we think upon it.\r\nPetrarch says, that he was never so young, but that he knew that he was\r\ngrowing old. Lady Lodore had never thought of this till a few months back;\r\nit seemed to her, that she had never known it until now--that she felt that\r\nshe was older--older than the vain and lovely bride of Lodore--than the\r\nhaughty high-spirited friend of Casimir Lyzinski. And where was Casimir?\r\nShe had never heard of him again, she had scarcely ever thought of him;\r\nhe had grown older too--change, the effects of passion or of destiny,\r\nmust have visited him also;--they were all embarked on one mighty\r\nstream--Lodore had gained a haven; but the living were still at the\r\nmercy of the vast torrent--whither would it hurry them?\r\n\r\nThere was a charm in these melancholy and speculative thoughts to the\r\nbeautiful exile--for we may be indeed as easily exiled by a few roods of\r\nground, as by mountains and seas. A strong decree of fate banished\r\nCornelia from the familiar past, into an unknown and strange present.\r\nStill she clung to the recollection of bygone years, and for the first\r\ntime gave way to reflections full of scenes and persons to be seen no\r\nmore. The tomb beside which she lingered, was an outward sign of these\r\npast events, and she did not like to lose sight of it so soon. She heard\r\nthat Mrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry was to remain away for a month--so much\r\ntime at least was hers. She inquired for lodgings, and was directed to\r\nDame Nixon's cottage. She was somewhat dismayed at first by its\r\npenurious appearance, but \"it would do for a few days;\" and she found\r\nthat what would serve for a few days, might serve for months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Man wants but little here below,\r\nNor wants that little long.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMost true for\r\nsolitary man. It is society that increases his desires. If Lady Lodore had\r\nbeen visited in her humble dwelling by the least regarded among her\r\nacquaintances, she would have felt keenly its glaring deficiencies. But\r\nalthough used to luxury, Margaret's cuisine sufficed for herself alone;\r\nthe low-roofed rooms were high enough, and the latticed windows which\r\nlet in the light of heaven, fulfilled their purpose as well as the\r\nplate-glass and lofty embrasures of a palace.\r\n\r\nLady Lodore was obliged also to consider one other thing, which forms so\r\nlarge a portion of our meditations in real life--her purse. She found when\r\nsettled in the cottage, in the Vale of Bewling, that her stock of money\r\nwas reduced to one hundred pounds. She could not cross the country and\r\nestablish herself at a distance from London with this sum only. She had\r\nbefore looked forward to selling her jewels and carriage as to a distant\r\nevent, but now she felt that it was the _next_ thing she must do. She\r\nshrunk from it naturally: the very idea of revisiting London--of seeing\r\nits busy shops and streets--once so full of life and its purposes to\r\nher, and in which she would now wander an alien, was inconceivably\r\nsaddening; she was willing to put off the necessity as long as possible,\r\nand thus continued to procrastinate her departure from Essex.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fitzhenry returned; but she could neither know nor dream of the\r\nvicinity of her sister-in-law. We are apt to think, when we know nothing\r\nof any one, that no one knows any thing of us; experience can scarcely\r\nteach us, that the reverse of this is often the truth. Seeing only an\r\nold woman in her dotage--and a poor love-sick girl, who knew nothing\r\nbeyond the one event which had blasted all her happiness--she never\r\nheard the inhabitants of Longfield mentioned, and believed that she was\r\nequally unheard of by them. Then her indisposition protracted her stay,\r\nand now the mortal illness of the poor woman. For she had become\r\ninterested for Margaret and promised to befriend her; and in case of her\r\ngrandmother's death, to take her from a spot where every association and\r\nappearance kept open the wounds inflicted by her unfaithful lover.\r\n\r\nTime had thus passed on: now sad, now cheerful, she tried to banish\r\nevery thought of the future, and to make the occurrences of each day\r\nfill and satisfy her mind. She lived obscurely and humbly, and perhaps\r\nas wisely as mortal may in this mysterious world, where hope is\r\nperpetually followed by disappointment, and action by repentance and\r\nregret. The days succeeded to each other in one unvaried tenor. The\r\nweather was cheerful, the breath of spring animating. She watched the\r\nswelling of the buds--the peeping heads of the crocuses--the opening of\r\nthe anemones and wild wind-flowers, and at last, the sweet odour of the\r\nnew-born violets, with all the interest created by novelty; not that she\r\nhad not observed and watched these things before, with transitory\r\npleasure, but now the operations of nature filled all her world; the\r\nearth was no longer merely the dwelling place of her acquaintance, the\r\nstage on which the business of society was carried on, but the mother of\r\nlife--the temple of God--the beautiful and varied store-house of\r\nbounteous nature.\r\n\r\nDwelling on these ideas, Cornelia often thought of Horatio Saville,\r\nwhose conversations, now remembered, were the source whence she drew the\r\nknowledge and poetry of her present reveries. As solitude and nature\r\ngrew lovely in her eyes, she yearned yet more fondly for the one who\r\ncould embellish all she saw. Yet while her mind needed a companion so\r\ncongenial to her present feelings, her heart was fuller of Ethel; her\r\naffection for Saville was a calm though deep-rooted sentiment, resulting\r\nfrom the conviction, that she should find entire happiness if united to\r\nhim, and in an esteem or rather an enthusiastic admiration of his\r\ntalents and virtues, that led her to dwell with complacency on the hope,\r\nthat he still remembered and loved her: but the human heart is jealous,\r\nand with difficulty admits two emotions of equal force, and her love for\r\nher daughter was the master passion. The instinct of nature spoke\r\naudibly within her; the atoms of her frame seemed alive each one as she\r\nthought of her; often her tears flowed, often her eyes brightened with\r\ngladness when alone, and the beloved image of her beautiful daughter as\r\nshe saw her last, smiling amidst penury and indignity, was her dearest\r\ncompanion by day and night. She alone made her present situation\r\nendurable, and yet separation from her was irksome beyond expression.\r\nWas she never to see or hear of her more? It was very hard: she implored\r\nProvidence to change the harsh decree--she longed inexpressibly for one\r\nword that had reference to her--one event, however slight, which should\r\nmake her existence palpable.\r\n\r\nWhen Margaret announced Mrs. Fitzhenry, her heart bounded with joy. She\r\ncould ask concerning Ethel--hear; her countenance was radiant with\r\ndelight, and she really for a moment thought her sister-in-law's visit\r\nwas meant in kindness, since so much pleasure was the result. This\r\nconviction had produced the very thing it anticipated. She had given\r\npoor Bessy no time to announce the actual intention with which she came;\r\nshe had borne away her sullen mood by force of sweet smiles and sweeter\r\nwords; and saw her depart with gladdened spirits, whispering to herself\r\nthe fresh hopes and fond emotions which filled her bosom. She walked\r\nback to her little garden and stooped to gather some fresh violets, and\r\nto prop a drooping jonquil heavy with its burthen of sweet blooms. She\r\ninhaled the vernal odours with rapture. \"Yes,\" she thought, \"nature is\r\nthe refuge and home for women: they have no public career--no aim nor\r\nend beyond their domestic circle; but they can extend that, and make all\r\nthe creations of nature their own, to foster and do good to. We\r\ncomplain, when shut up in cities of the niggard rules of society, which\r\ngives us only the drawing-room or ball-room in which to display our\r\ntalents, and which, for ever turning the sympathy of those around us\r\ninto envy on the part of women, or what is called love on that of men,\r\nbesets our path with dangers or sorrows. But throw aside all vanity, no\r\nlonger seek to surpass your own sex, nor to inspire the other with\r\nfeelings which are pregnant with disquiet or misery, and which seldom\r\nend in mutual benevolence, turn your steps to the habitation which God\r\nhas given as befitting his creatures, contemplate the lovely ornaments\r\nwith which he has blessed the earth;--here is no heart-burning nor\r\ncalumny; it is better to love, to be of use to one of these flowers,\r\nthan to be the admired of the many--the mere puppet of one's own\r\nvanity.\"\r\n\r\nLady Lodore entered the house; she asked concerning her poor hostess, and\r\nlearnt that she slept. For a short time she employed herself with her\r\nembroidery; her thoughts were all awake; and as her fingers created\r\nlikenesses of the flowers she loved, several times her eyes filled with\r\ntears as she thought of Ethel, and how happy she could be if her fate\r\npermitted her to cultivate her affection and enjoy her society.\r\n\r\n\"It is very sad,\" she thought; \"only a few minutes ago my spirits were\r\nbuoyant, gladdened as they were by Bessy's visit; but they flag again,\r\nwhen I think of my loneliness and the unreplying silence of this place.\r\nWhat is to become of me? I shall remain here: yes; I shall not banish\r\nmyself to some inhospitable nook, where I should never hear her name.\r\nBut am I not to see her again? Am I to be nothing to her? Is she\r\nsatisfied with my absence--and are they all--to whom I am bound by ties\r\nof consanguinity or affection, indifferent to the knowledge of whether I\r\nexist or not? Nothing gives token to them of my life; it is as if the\r\ngrave had closed abruptly over me--and had it closed, thus I should have\r\nbeen mourned, in coldness and neglect.\"\r\n\r\nAgain her eyes were suffused; but as she wiped away the blinding tears,\r\nshe was recalled from her reflections by the bright rays of the sun\r\nwhich entered her little room. She threw open the door, stepped out into\r\nthe garden--the sun was setting; the atmosphere was calm, and lighted up\r\nby golden beams; the few clouds were dyed in the same splendid hues, the\r\nbirds sent forth a joyous song at intervals, and a band of rooks passed\r\nabove the little wood, cawing loudly. The air was balmy, the\r\nindescribable freshness of spring was abroad, interpenetrating and\r\ncheerful. Cornelia's melancholy fled as she felt and gave way to its\r\ninfluence. \"God blesses all things,\" she thought, \"and he will also\r\nbless me. Much wrong have I done, but love pure and disinterested is in\r\nmy heart, and I shall be repaid. My own sweet Ethel! I have sacrificed\r\nevery thing except my life for your sake, and I would add my life to the\r\ngift, could it avail you. I ask but for you and your love. The world has\r\nmany blessings, and I have asked for them before, with tears and\r\nanguish, but I give up all now, except you, my child. You are all the\r\nworld to me! Will you not come, even now, as I implore Heaven to give\r\nyou to me?\"\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes in prayer, and it seemed as if her wishes were to be\r\naccomplished--surely once in a life God will grant the earnest entreaty\r\nof a loving heart. Cornelia believed that he would, that happiness was\r\nnear at hand, and life not all a blank. She heard a rustling among the\r\ntrees, a light step;--was it Margaret? She had scarcely asked herself\r\nthis question, when the dear object of her every thought and hope was\r\nbefore her--in her arms;--Ethel had entered from the wood, had seen her\r\nmother, had sprung forward and clasped her to her heart.\r\n\r\n\"My dear, dear child!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dearest mother!\" repeated Ethel, as her eyes were filled with tears of\r\ndelight, \"why did you go--why conceal yourself? You do not know the\r\nanxiety we have suffered, and how very unhappy your absence has made us.\r\nBut I have found you--of all that have gone to seek you, I have found\r\nyou; I deserve this reward, for I love you most of all.\"\r\n\r\nLady Lodore returned her daughter's caresses--and her tears flowed fast for\r\nvery joy, and then she turned to Mrs. Fitzhenry, who followed Ethel, but\r\nwho had been outspeeded by her in her eagerness. The old lady's face was\r\nbeaming with happiness. \"Ah, Bessy, you have betrayed me--traitress! I\r\ndid not expect this--I do not deserve such excessive happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"You deserve all, and much more than we can any of us bestow,\" cried\r\nEthel, \"except that your dear generous heart will repay you beyond any\r\nreward we can give, and you will be blest in the happiness we owe to you\r\nalone. Edward is gone far away into Wales in quest of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"An Angelica run after by the Paladins,\" said Lady Lodore, smiling through\r\nher tears.\r\n\r\n\"Paladins, worthy the name!\" replied Ethel. \"Horatio is even now on the\r\nsalt seas for your sake--he is returning discomfited and hopeless from\r\nhis journey of discovery to the Pyrenees--his zeal almost deserved the\r\nreward which I have found, yet who but she, for whom you sacrificed so\r\nmuch, ought to be the first to thank you? And while we all try to show\r\nyou an inexpressible gratitude, ought not I to be the first to see,\r\nfirst to kiss, first--always the first--to love you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nNone, I trust,\r\nRepines at these delights, they are free and harmless:\r\nAfter distress at sea, the dangers o'er,\r\nSafety and welcomes better taste ashore.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus the tale of \"Lodore\" is ended. The person who bore that title by right\r\nof descent, has long slept in peace in the church of his native village.\r\nNeither his own passions, nor those of others, can renew the pulsations\r\nof his heart. \"The silver cord is loosed, and the pitcher broken at the\r\nfountain.\" His life had not been fruitless. The sedulous care and\r\nadmirable education he had bestowed on Ethel, would, had he lived, have\r\ncompensated to him for his many sufferings, and been a source of pure\r\nand unfading joy to the end. He was not destined in this world to reap\r\nthe harvest of his virtues, though his errors had been punished\r\nseverely. Still his memory is the presiding genius of his daughter's\r\nlife, and the name of Lodore contains for her a spell that dignifies\r\nexistence in her own eyes, and incites her to render all her thoughts\r\nand actions such as her beloved father would have approved. It was fated\r\nthat the evil which he did should die with him--but the good out-lived\r\nhim long, and was a blessing to those whom he loved far better than\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nShe who received the title on her marriage, henceforth continued her\r\nexistence under another; and the wife of Saville, who soon after became\r\nViscountess Maristow, loses her right to be chronicled in these pages.\r\nSo few years indeed are passed since the period to which the last\r\nchapter brought us, that it may be safely announced that Cornelia\r\nSanterre possesses that happiness, through her generosity and devoted\r\naffection, which she had lost through pride and self-exaltation. She\r\nwonders at her past self--and laments the many opportunities she lost\r\nfor benefiting others, and proving herself worthy of their attachment.\r\nHer pride is gone, or rather, her pride is now placed in redeeming her\r\nfaults. She is humble, knowing how much she was deceived in herself--she\r\nis forgiving, for she feels that she needs forgiveness. She looks on the\r\ntrack of years she has passed over as wasted, and she wishes to retrieve\r\ntheir loss. She respects, admires, in some sense it may be said, that\r\nshe adores her husband; but even while consenting to be his, and thus\r\nsecuring her own happiness, she told him that her first duties were\r\ntowards Ethel--and that he took a divided heart, over the better part of\r\nwhich reigned maternal love. Saville, the least egoistic of human\r\nbeings, smiled to hear her name that a defect, which was in his eyes her\r\ncrowning virtue.\r\n\r\nEdward Villiers learnt to prize worldly prosperity at its true value,\r\nand each day blesses the train of circumstances that led him to wed\r\nEthel, even though poverty and suffering had followed close behind.\r\nEthel herself might be said to have been always happy. She was incapable\r\nof being impressed by any sorrow, that did not touch her for another's\r\nsake: and while she exerted herself to alleviate the pain endured by\r\nthose she loved, she passed on unhurt. Heaven spared her life's most\r\ncruel evils. Death had done its worst when she lost her father. Now,\r\nsurrounded by dear friends, and the object of her husband's constant\r\ntenderness, she pursues a tranquil course: which for any one to consider\r\nthe most blissful allotted to mortals, they must have a heart like her\r\nown--faithful, affectionate, and generous.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry, kind and gentle aunt Bessy, always felt her\r\nheaven clouded while she indulged in her aversion to her sister-in-law.\r\nShe is happy now that she is reconciled to Cornelia; strange to say, she\r\nloves her even more than she loves Ethel--she is more intimately\r\nconnected in her mind with the memory of Lodore. She often visits her at\r\nMaristow Castle; in the neighbourhood of which Margaret is settled,\r\nbeing happily married. Colonel Villiers still lives in Paris. He is in a\r\nmiserable state of poverty, difficulty, and ill-health. His wife has\r\ndeserted him: he neglected and outraged her, and she in a fit of remorse\r\nleft him, and returned to nurse her father during a lingering illness,\r\nwhich is likely to continue to the end of his life, though he shows no\r\nsymptoms of immediate decay. He is eager to lavish all his wealth on his\r\nchild, if he can be sure that no portion of it is shared by her husband.\r\nWith infinite difficulty, and at the cost of many privations, she, with\r\na true woman's feeling, contrives to send him remittances now and then,\r\nthough she receives in return neither thanks nor kindness. He pursues a\r\ncourse of dissipation in its most degraded form--a wretched hanger-on at\r\nresorts, misnamed of pleasure--gambling while he has any money to\r\nlose--trying to ruin others as he has been ruined.\r\n\r\nThus we have done our duty, in bringing under view, in a brief summary,\r\nthe little that there is to tell of the personages who formed the drama\r\nof this tale. One only remains to be mentioned: but it is not in a few\r\ntame lines that we can revert to the varied fate of Fanny Derham. She\r\ncontinued for some time among her beloved friends, innocent and calm as\r\nshe was beautiful and wise; circumstances at last led her away from\r\nthem, and she has entered upon life. One who feels so deeply for others,\r\nand yet is so stern a censor over herself--at once so sensitive and so\r\nrigidly conscientious--so single-minded and upright, and yet open as day\r\nto charity and affection, cannot hope to pass from youth to age\r\nunharmed. Deceit, and selfishness, and the whole web of human passion\r\nmust envelope her, and occasion her many sorrows; and the unworthiness\r\nof her fellow-creatures inflict infinite pain on her noble heart: still\r\nshe cannot be contaminated--she will turn neither to the right nor left,\r\nbut pursue her way unflinching; and, in her lofty idea of the dignity of\r\nher nature, in her love of truth and in her integrity, she will find\r\nsupport and reward in her various fortunes. What the events are, that\r\nhave already diversified her existence, cannot now be recounted; and it\r\nwould require the gift of prophecy to foretell the conclusion. In after\r\ntimes these may be told, and the life of Fanny Derham be presented as a\r\nuseful lesson, at once to teach what goodness and genius can achieve in\r\npalliating the woes of life, and to encourage those, who would in any\r\nway imitate her, by an example of calumny refuted by patience, errors\r\nrectified by charity, and the passions of our nature purified and\r\nennobled by an underviating observance of those moral laws on which all\r\nhuman excellence is founded--a love of truth in ourselves, and a sincere\r\nsympathy with our fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LODORE, VOL. 3 (OF 3) ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

You are this day 55. If a woman\r\nmay ever be said to be in safety from the determined Perseverance of\r\ndisagreeable Lovers and the cruel Persecutions of obstinate Fathers,\r\nsurely it must be at such a time of Life. Isabel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 2nd LAURA to ISABEL\r\n\r\nAltho' I cannot agree with you in supposing that I shall never again be\r\nexposed to Misfortunes as unmerited as those I have already experienced,\r\nyet to avoid the imputation of Obstinacy or ill-nature, I will gratify\r\nthe curiosity of your daughter; and may the fortitude with which I have\r\nsuffered the many afflictions of my past Life, prove to her a useful\r\nlesson for the support of those which may befall her in her own. Laura\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 3rd LAURA to MARIANNE\r\n\r\nAs the Daughter of my most intimate freind I think you entitled to that\r\nknowledge of my unhappy story, which your Mother has so often solicited\r\nme to give you.\r\n\r\nMy Father was a native of Ireland and an inhabitant of Wales; my Mother\r\nwas the natural Daughter of a Scotch Peer by an italian Opera-girl--I\r\nwas born in Spain and received my Education at a Convent in France.\r\n\r\nWhen I had reached my eighteenth Year I was recalled by my Parents to\r\nmy paternal roof in Wales. Our mansion was situated in one of the most\r\nromantic parts of the Vale of Uske. Tho' my Charms are now considerably\r\nsoftened and somewhat impaired by the Misfortunes I have undergone, I\r\nwas once beautiful. But lovely as I was the Graces of my Person were the\r\nleast of my Perfections. Of every accomplishment accustomary to my sex,\r\nI was Mistress. When in the Convent, my progress had always exceeded my\r\ninstructions, my Acquirements had been wonderfull for my age, and I had\r\nshortly surpassed my Masters.\r\n\r\nIn my Mind, every Virtue that could adorn it was centered; it was the\r\nRendez-vous of every good Quality and of every noble sentiment.\r\n\r\nA sensibility too tremblingly alive to every affliction of my Freinds,\r\nmy Acquaintance and particularly to every affliction of my own, was my\r\nonly fault, if a fault it could be called. Alas! how altered now! Tho'\r\nindeed my own Misfortunes do not make less impression on me than they\r\never did, yet now I never feel for those of an other. My accomplishments\r\ntoo, begin to fade--I can neither sing so well nor Dance so gracefully\r\nas I once did--and I have entirely forgot the MINUET DELA COUR. Adeiu.\r\nLaura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 4th Laura to MARIANNE\r\n\r\nOur neighbourhood was small, for it consisted only of your Mother. She\r\nmay probably have already told you that being left by her Parents\r\nin indigent Circumstances she had retired into Wales on eoconomical\r\nmotives. There it was our freindship first commenced. Isobel was then\r\none and twenty. Tho' pleasing both in her Person and Manners (between\r\nourselves) she never possessed the hundredth part of my Beauty or\r\nAccomplishments. Isabel had seen the World. She had passed 2 Years at\r\none of the first Boarding-schools in London; had spent a fortnight in\r\nBath and had supped one night in Southampton.\r\n\r\n\u201cBeware my Laura (she would often say) Beware of the insipid Vanities\r\nand idle Dissipations of the Metropolis of England; Beware of the\r\nunmeaning Luxuries of Bath and of the stinking fish of Southampton.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlas! (exclaimed I) how am I to avoid those evils I shall never\r\nbe exposed to? What probability is there of my ever tasting the\r\nDissipations of London, the Luxuries of Bath, or the stinking Fish of\r\nSouthampton? I who am doomed to waste my Days of Youth and Beauty in an\r\nhumble Cottage in the Vale of Uske.\u201d\r\n\r\nAh! little did I then think I was ordained so soon to quit that humble\r\nCottage for the Deceitfull Pleasures of the World. Adeiu Laura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 5th LAURA to MARIANNE\r\n\r\nOne Evening in December as my Father, my Mother and myself, were\r\narranged in social converse round our Fireside, we were on a sudden\r\ngreatly astonished, by hearing a violent knocking on the outward door of\r\nour rustic Cot.\r\n\r\nMy Father started--\u201cWhat noise is that,\u201d (said he.) \u201cIt sounds like a\r\nloud rapping at the door\u201d--(replied my Mother.) \u201cit does indeed.\u201d (cried\r\nI.) \u201cI am of your opinion; (said my Father) it certainly does appear\r\nto proceed from some uncommon violence exerted against our unoffending\r\ndoor.\u201d \u201cYes (exclaimed I) I cannot help thinking it must be somebody who\r\nknocks for admittance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is another point (replied he;) We must not pretend to determine\r\non what motive the person may knock--tho' that someone DOES rap at the\r\ndoor, I am partly convinced.\u201d\r\n\r\nHere, a 2d tremendous rap interrupted my Father in his speech, and\r\nsomewhat alarmed my Mother and me.\r\n\r\n\u201cHad we better not go and see who it is? (said she) the servants are\r\nout.\u201d \u201cI think we had.\u201d (replied I.) \u201cCertainly, (added my Father)\r\nby all means.\u201d \u201cShall we go now?\u201d (said my Mother,) \u201cThe sooner the\r\nbetter.\u201d (answered he.) \u201cOh! let no time be lost\u201d (cried I.)\r\n\r\nA third more violent Rap than ever again assaulted our ears. \u201cI am\r\ncertain there is somebody knocking at the Door.\u201d (said my Mother.)\r\n\u201cI think there must,\u201d (replied my Father) \u201cI fancy the servants are\r\nreturned; (said I) I think I hear Mary going to the Door.\u201d \u201cI'm glad of\r\nit (cried my Father) for I long to know who it is.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was right in my conjecture; for Mary instantly entering the Room,\r\ninformed us that a young Gentleman and his Servant were at the door, who\r\nhad lossed their way, were very cold and begged leave to warm themselves\r\nby our fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cWon't you admit them?\u201d (said I.) \u201cYou have no objection, my Dear?\u201d\r\n (said my Father.) \u201cNone in the World.\u201d (replied my Mother.)\r\n\r\nMary, without waiting for any further commands immediately left the room\r\nand quickly returned introducing the most beauteous and amiable Youth, I\r\nhad ever beheld. The servant she kept to herself.\r\n\r\nMy natural sensibility had already been greatly affected by the\r\nsufferings of the unfortunate stranger and no sooner did I first behold\r\nhim, than I felt that on him the happiness or Misery of my future Life\r\nmust depend. Adeiu Laura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 6th LAURA to MARIANNE\r\n\r\nThe noble Youth informed us that his name was Lindsay--for particular\r\nreasons however I shall conceal it under that of Talbot. He told us that\r\nhe was the son of an English Baronet, that his Mother had been for many\r\nyears no more and that he had a Sister of the middle size. \u201cMy Father\r\n(he continued) is a mean and mercenary wretch--it is only to such\r\nparticular freinds as this Dear Party that I would thus betray his\r\nfailings. Your Virtues my amiable Polydore (addressing himself to my\r\nfather) yours Dear Claudia and yours my Charming Laura call on me to\r\nrepose in you, my confidence.\u201d We bowed. \u201cMy Father seduced by the false\r\nglare of Fortune and the Deluding Pomp of Title, insisted on my giving\r\nmy hand to Lady Dorothea. No never exclaimed I. Lady Dorothea is lovely\r\nand Engaging; I prefer no woman to her; but know Sir, that I scorn to\r\nmarry her in compliance with your Wishes. No! Never shall it be said\r\nthat I obliged my Father.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe all admired the noble Manliness of his reply. He continued.\r\n\r\n\u201cSir Edward was surprised; he had perhaps little expected to meet with\r\nso spirited an opposition to his will. \u201cWhere, Edward in the name of\r\nwonder (said he) did you pick up this unmeaning gibberish? You have\r\nbeen studying Novels I suspect.\u201d I scorned to answer: it would have\r\nbeen beneath my dignity. I mounted my Horse and followed by my faithful\r\nWilliam set forth for my Aunts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy Father's house is situated in Bedfordshire, my Aunt's in Middlesex,\r\nand tho' I flatter myself with being a tolerable proficient in\r\nGeography, I know not how it happened, but I found myself entering this\r\nbeautifull Vale which I find is in South Wales, when I had expected to\r\nhave reached my Aunts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter having wandered some time on the Banks of the Uske without\r\nknowing which way to go, I began to lament my cruel Destiny in the\r\nbitterest and most pathetic Manner. It was now perfectly dark, not a\r\nsingle star was there to direct my steps, and I know not what might have\r\nbefallen me had I not at length discerned thro' the solemn Gloom that\r\nsurrounded me a distant light, which as I approached it, I discovered\r\nto be the chearfull Blaze of your fire. Impelled by the combination\r\nof Misfortunes under which I laboured, namely Fear, Cold and Hunger I\r\nhesitated not to ask admittance which at length I have gained; and\r\nnow my Adorable Laura (continued he taking my Hand) when may I hope\r\nto receive that reward of all the painfull sufferings I have undergone\r\nduring the course of my attachment to you, to which I have ever aspired.\r\nOh! when will you reward me with Yourself?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis instant, Dear and Amiable Edward.\u201d (replied I.). We were\r\nimmediately united by my Father, who tho' he had never taken orders had\r\nbeen bred to the Church. Adeiu Laura\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 7th LAURA to MARIANNE\r\n\r\nWe remained but a few days after our Marriage, in the Vale of Uske.\r\nAfter taking an affecting Farewell of my Father, my Mother and my\r\nIsabel, I accompanied Edward to his Aunt's in Middlesex. Philippa\r\nreceived us both with every expression of affectionate Love. My arrival\r\nwas indeed a most agreable surprise to her as she had not only been\r\ntotally ignorant of my Marriage with her Nephew, but had never even had\r\nthe slightest idea of there being such a person in the World.\r\n\r\nAugusta, the sister of Edward was on a visit to her when we arrived.\r\nI found her exactly what her Brother had described her to be--of the\r\nmiddle size. She received me with equal surprise though not with equal\r\nCordiality, as Philippa. There was a disagreable coldness and Forbidding\r\nReserve in her reception of me which was equally distressing and\r\nUnexpected. None of that interesting Sensibility or amiable simpathy\r\nin her manners and Address to me when we first met which should have\r\ndistinguished our introduction to each other. Her Language was neither\r\nwarm, nor affectionate, her expressions of regard were neither animated\r\nnor cordial; her arms were not opened to receive me to her Heart, tho'\r\nmy own were extended to press her to mine.\r\n\r\nA short Conversation between Augusta and her Brother, which I\r\naccidentally overheard encreased my dislike to her, and convinced me\r\nthat her Heart was no more formed for the soft ties of Love than for the\r\nendearing intercourse of Freindship.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut do you think that my Father will ever be reconciled to this\r\nimprudent connection?\u201d (said Augusta.)\r\n\r\n\u201cAugusta (replied the noble Youth) I thought you had a better opinion of\r\nme, than to imagine I would so abjectly degrade myself as to consider\r\nmy Father's Concurrence in any of my affairs, either of Consequence\r\nor concern to me. Tell me Augusta with sincerity; did you ever know\r\nme consult his inclinations or follow his Advice in the least trifling\r\nParticular since the age of fifteen?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEdward (replied she) you are surely too diffident in your own praise.\r\nSince you were fifteen only! My Dear Brother since you were five years\r\nold, I entirely acquit you of ever having willingly contributed to the\r\nsatisfaction of your Father. But still I am not without apprehensions\r\nof your being shortly obliged to degrade yourself in your own eyes by\r\nseeking a support for your wife in the Generosity of Sir Edward.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever, never Augusta will I so demean myself. (said Edward). Support!\r\nWhat support will Laura want which she can receive from him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly those very insignificant ones of Victuals and Drink.\u201d (answered\r\nshe.)\r\n\r\n\u201cVictuals and Drink! (replied my Husband in a most nobly contemptuous\r\nManner) and dost thou then imagine that there is no other support for\r\nan exalted mind (such as is my Laura's) than the mean and indelicate\r\nemployment of Eating and Drinking?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone that I know of, so efficacious.\u201d (returned Augusta).\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd did you then never feel the pleasing Pangs of Love, Augusta?\r\n(replied my Edward). Does it appear impossible to your vile and\r\ncorrupted Palate, to exist on Love? Can you not conceive the Luxury of\r\nliving in every distress that Poverty can inflict, with the object of\r\nyour tenderest affection?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are too ridiculous (said Augusta) to argue with; perhaps however\r\nyou may in time be convinced that...\u201d\r\n\r\nHere I was prevented from hearing the remainder of her speech, by the\r\nappearance of a very Handsome young Woman, who was ushured into the Room\r\nat the Door of which I had been listening. On hearing her announced by\r\nthe Name of \u201cLady Dorothea,\u201d I instantly quitted my Post and followed\r\nher into the Parlour, for I well remembered that she was the Lady,\r\nproposed as a Wife for my Edward by the Cruel and Unrelenting Baronet.\r\n\r\nAltho' Lady Dorothea's visit was nominally to Philippa and Augusta, yet\r\nI have some reason to imagine that (acquainted with the Marriage and\r\narrival of Edward) to see me was a principal motive to it.\r\n\r\nI soon perceived that tho' Lovely and Elegant in her Person and tho'\r\nEasy and Polite in her Address, she was of that inferior order of\r\nBeings with regard to Delicate Feeling, tender Sentiments, and refined\r\nSensibility, of which Augusta was one.\r\n\r\nShe staid but half an hour and neither in the Course of her Visit,\r\nconfided to me any of her secret thoughts, nor requested me to confide\r\nin her, any of Mine. You will easily imagine therefore my Dear Marianne\r\nthat I could not feel any ardent affection or very sincere Attachment\r\nfor Lady Dorothea. Adeiu Laura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 8th LAURA to MARIANNE, in continuation\r\n\r\nLady Dorothea had not left us long before another visitor as unexpected\r\na one as her Ladyship, was announced. It was Sir Edward, who informed\r\nby Augusta of her Brother's marriage, came doubtless to reproach him for\r\nhaving dared to unite himself to me without his Knowledge. But Edward\r\nforeseeing his design, approached him with heroic fortitude as soon as\r\nhe entered the Room, and addressed him in the following Manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cSir Edward, I know the motive of your Journey here--You come with the\r\nbase Design of reproaching me for having entered into an indissoluble\r\nengagement with my Laura without your Consent. But Sir, I glory in the\r\nAct--. It is my greatest boast that I have incurred the displeasure of\r\nmy Father!\u201d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he took my hand and whilst Sir Edward, Philippa, and Augusta\r\nwere doubtless reflecting with admiration on his undaunted Bravery, led\r\nme from the Parlour to his Father's Carriage which yet remained at the\r\nDoor and in which we were instantly conveyed from the pursuit of Sir\r\nEdward.\r\n\r\nThe Postilions had at first received orders only to take the London\r\nroad; as soon as we had sufficiently reflected However, we ordered them\r\nto Drive to M----. the seat of Edward's most particular freind, which\r\nwas but a few miles distant.\r\n\r\nAt M----. we arrived in a few hours; and on sending in our names were\r\nimmediately admitted to Sophia, the Wife of Edward's freind. After\r\nhaving been deprived during the course of 3 weeks of a real freind (for\r\nsuch I term your Mother) imagine my transports at beholding one, most\r\ntruly worthy of the Name. Sophia was rather above the middle size; most\r\nelegantly formed. A soft languor spread over her lovely features, but\r\nincreased their Beauty--. It was the Charectarestic of her Mind--. She\r\nwas all sensibility and Feeling. We flew into each others arms and after\r\nhaving exchanged vows of mutual Freindship for the rest of our Lives,\r\ninstantly unfolded to each other the most inward secrets of our\r\nHearts--. We were interrupted in the delightfull Employment by the\r\nentrance of Augustus, (Edward's freind) who was just returned from a\r\nsolitary ramble.\r\n\r\nNever did I see such an affecting Scene as was the meeting of Edward and\r\nAugustus.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy Life! my Soul!\u201d (exclaimed the former) \u201cMy adorable angel!\u201d (replied\r\nthe latter) as they flew into each other's arms. It was too pathetic\r\nfor the feelings of Sophia and myself--We fainted alternately on a sofa.\r\nAdeiu Laura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the 9th From the same to the same\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the day we received the following Letter from\r\nPhilippa.\r\n\r\n\u201cSir Edward is greatly incensed by your abrupt departure; he has\r\ntaken back Augusta to Bedfordshire. Much as I wish to enjoy again your\r\ncharming society, I cannot determine to snatch you from that, of such\r\ndear and deserving Freinds--When your Visit to them is terminated, I\r\ntrust you will return to the arms of your\u201d \u201cPhilippa.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe returned a suitable answer to this affectionate Note and after\r\nthanking her for her kind invitation assured her that we would certainly\r\navail ourselves of it, whenever we might have no other place to go to.\r\nTho' certainly nothing could to any reasonable Being, have appeared more\r\nsatisfactory, than so gratefull a reply to her invitation, yet I know\r\nnot how it was, but she was certainly capricious enough to be displeased\r\nwith our behaviour and in a few weeks after, either to revenge our\r\nConduct, or releive her own solitude, married a young and illiterate\r\nFortune-hunter. This imprudent step (tho' we were sensible that it would\r\nprobably deprive us of that fortune which Philippa had ever taught us to\r\nexpect) could not on our own accounts, excite from our exalted minds a\r\nsingle sigh; yet fearfull lest it might prove a source of endless misery\r\nto the deluded Bride, our trembling Sensibility was greatly affected\r\nwhen we were first informed of the Event. The affectionate Entreaties of\r\nAugustus and Sophia that we would for ever consider their House as our\r\nHome, easily prevailed on us to determine never more to leave them, In\r\nthe society of my Edward and this Amiable Pair, I passed the happiest\r\nmoments of my Life; Our time was most delightfully spent, in mutual\r\nProtestations of Freindship, and in vows of unalterable Love, in which\r\nwe were secure from being interrupted, by intruding and disagreable\r\nVisitors, as Augustus and Sophia had on their first Entrance in the\r\nNeighbourhood, taken due care to inform the surrounding Families, that\r\nas their happiness centered wholly in themselves, they wished for no\r\nother society. But alas! my Dear Marianne such Happiness as I then\r\nenjoyed was too perfect to be lasting. A most severe and unexpected Blow\r\nat once destroyed every sensation of Pleasure. Convinced as you must be\r\nfrom what I have already told you concerning Augustus and Sophia, that\r\nthere never were a happier Couple, I need not I imagine, inform you that\r\ntheir union had been contrary to the inclinations of their Cruel\r\nand Mercenery Parents; who had vainly endeavoured with obstinate\r\nPerseverance to force them into a Marriage with those whom they had ever\r\nabhorred; but with a Heroic Fortitude worthy to be related and admired,\r\nthey had both, constantly refused to submit to such despotic Power.\r\n\r\nAfter having so nobly disentangled themselves from the shackles of\r\nParental Authority, by a Clandestine Marriage, they were determined\r\nnever to forfeit the good opinion they had gained in the World, in\r\nso doing, by accepting any proposals of reconciliation that might be\r\noffered them by their Fathers--to this farther tryal of their noble\r\nindependance however they never were exposed.\r\n\r\nThey had been married but a few months when our visit to them commenced\r\nduring which time they had been amply supported by a considerable sum of\r\nmoney which Augustus had gracefully purloined from his unworthy father's\r\nEscritoire, a few days before his union with Sophia.\r\n\r\nBy our arrival their Expenses were considerably encreased tho' their\r\nmeans for supplying them were then nearly exhausted. But they, Exalted\r\nCreatures! scorned to reflect a moment on their pecuniary Distresses and\r\nwould have blushed at the idea of paying their Debts.--Alas! what was\r\ntheir Reward for such disinterested Behaviour! The beautifull Augustus\r\nwas arrested and we were all undone. Such perfidious Treachery in the\r\nmerciless perpetrators of the Deed will shock your gentle nature Dearest\r\nMarianne as much as it then affected the Delicate sensibility of\r\nEdward, Sophia, your Laura, and of Augustus himself. To compleat such\r\nunparalelled Barbarity we were informed that an Execution in the House\r\nwould shortly take place. Ah! what could we do but what we did! We\r\nsighed and fainted on the sofa. Adeiu Laura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 10th LAURA in continuation\r\n\r\nWhen we were somewhat recovered from the overpowering Effusions of our\r\ngrief, Edward desired that we would consider what was the most prudent\r\nstep to be taken in our unhappy situation while he repaired to his\r\nimprisoned freind to lament over his misfortunes. We promised that we\r\nwould, and he set forwards on his journey to Town. During his absence\r\nwe faithfully complied with his Desire and after the most mature\r\nDeliberation, at length agreed that the best thing we could do was\r\nto leave the House; of which we every moment expected the officers\r\nof Justice to take possession. We waited therefore with the greatest\r\nimpatience, for the return of Edward in order to impart to him the\r\nresult of our Deliberations. But no Edward appeared. In vain did we\r\ncount the tedious moments of his absence--in vain did we weep--in\r\nvain even did we sigh--no Edward returned--. This was too cruel, too\r\nunexpected a Blow to our Gentle Sensibility--we could not support it--we\r\ncould only faint. At length collecting all the Resolution I was Mistress\r\nof, I arose and after packing up some necessary apparel for Sophia and\r\nmyself, I dragged her to a Carriage I had ordered and we instantly set\r\nout for London. As the Habitation of Augustus was within twelve miles\r\nof Town, it was not long e'er we arrived there, and no sooner had we\r\nentered Holboun than letting down one of the Front Glasses I enquired of\r\nevery decent-looking Person that we passed \u201cIf they had seen my Edward?\u201d\r\n\r\nBut as we drove too rapidly to allow them to answer my repeated\r\nEnquiries, I gained little, or indeed, no information concerning him.\r\n\u201cWhere am I to drive?\u201d said the Postilion. \u201cTo Newgate Gentle Youth\r\n(replied I), to see Augustus.\u201d \u201cOh! no, no, (exclaimed Sophia) I cannot\r\ngo to Newgate; I shall not be able to support the sight of my Augustus\r\nin so cruel a confinement--my feelings are sufficiently shocked by\r\nthe RECITAL, of his Distress, but to behold it will overpower my\r\nSensibility.\u201d As I perfectly agreed with her in the Justice of her\r\nSentiments the Postilion was instantly directed to return into the\r\nCountry. You may perhaps have been somewhat surprised my Dearest\r\nMarianne, that in the Distress I then endured, destitute of any support,\r\nand unprovided with any Habitation, I should never once have remembered\r\nmy Father and Mother or my paternal Cottage in the Vale of Uske. To\r\naccount for this seeming forgetfullness I must inform you of a trifling\r\ncircumstance concerning them which I have as yet never mentioned. The\r\ndeath of my Parents a few weeks after my Departure, is the circumstance\r\nI allude to. By their decease I became the lawfull Inheritress of their\r\nHouse and Fortune. But alas! the House had never been their own and\r\ntheir Fortune had only been an Annuity on their own Lives. Such is\r\nthe Depravity of the World! To your Mother I should have returned with\r\nPleasure, should have been happy to have introduced to her, my charming\r\nSophia and should with Chearfullness have passed the remainder of my\r\nLife in their dear Society in the Vale of Uske, had not one obstacle\r\nto the execution of so agreable a scheme, intervened; which was the\r\nMarriage and Removal of your Mother to a distant part of Ireland. Adeiu\r\nLaura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 11th LAURA in continuation\r\n\r\n\u201cI have a Relation in Scotland (said Sophia to me as we left London) who\r\nI am certain would not hesitate in receiving me.\u201d \u201cShall I order the Boy\r\nto drive there?\u201d said I--but instantly recollecting myself, exclaimed,\r\n\u201cAlas I fear it will be too long a Journey for the Horses.\u201d Unwilling\r\nhowever to act only from my own inadequate Knowledge of the Strength and\r\nAbilities of Horses, I consulted the Postilion, who was entirely of my\r\nOpinion concerning the Affair. We therefore determined to change Horses\r\nat the next Town and to travel Post the remainder of the Journey--. When\r\nwe arrived at the last Inn we were to stop at, which was but a few miles\r\nfrom the House of Sophia's Relation, unwilling to intrude our Society on\r\nhim unexpected and unthought of, we wrote a very elegant and well\r\npenned Note to him containing an account of our Destitute and melancholy\r\nSituation, and of our intention to spend some months with him in\r\nScotland. As soon as we had dispatched this Letter, we immediately\r\nprepared to follow it in person and were stepping into the Carriage\r\nfor that Purpose when our attention was attracted by the Entrance of\r\na coroneted Coach and 4 into the Inn-yard. A Gentleman considerably\r\nadvanced in years descended from it. At his first Appearance my\r\nSensibility was wonderfully affected and e'er I had gazed at him a 2d\r\ntime, an instinctive sympathy whispered to my Heart, that he was my\r\nGrandfather. Convinced that I could not be mistaken in my conjecture I\r\ninstantly sprang from the Carriage I had just entered, and following the\r\nVenerable Stranger into the Room he had been shewn to, I threw myself\r\non my knees before him and besought him to acknowledge me as his Grand\r\nChild. He started, and having attentively examined my features, raised\r\nme from the Ground and throwing his Grand-fatherly arms around my Neck,\r\nexclaimed, \u201cAcknowledge thee! Yes dear resemblance of my Laurina and\r\nLaurina's Daughter, sweet image of my Claudia and my Claudia's Mother,\r\nI do acknowledge thee as the Daughter of the one and the Grandaughter of\r\nthe other.\u201d While he was thus tenderly embracing me, Sophia astonished\r\nat my precipitate Departure, entered the Room in search of me. No sooner\r\nhad she caught the eye of the venerable Peer, than he exclaimed with\r\nevery mark of Astonishment--\u201cAnother Grandaughter! Yes, yes, I see you\r\nare the Daughter of my Laurina's eldest Girl; your resemblance to the\r\nbeauteous Matilda sufficiently proclaims it. \u201cOh!\u201d replied Sophia, \u201cwhen\r\nI first beheld you the instinct of Nature whispered me that we were in\r\nsome degree related--But whether Grandfathers, or Grandmothers, I could\r\nnot pretend to determine.\u201d He folded her in his arms, and whilst they\r\nwere tenderly embracing, the Door of the Apartment opened and a most\r\nbeautifull young Man appeared. On perceiving him Lord St. Clair started\r\nand retreating back a few paces, with uplifted Hands, said, \u201cAnother\r\nGrand-child! What an unexpected Happiness is this! to discover in the\r\nspace of 3 minutes, as many of my Descendants! This I am certain is\r\nPhilander the son of my Laurina's 3d girl the amiable Bertha; there\r\nwants now but the presence of Gustavus to compleat the Union of my\r\nLaurina's Grand-Children.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd here he is; (said a Gracefull Youth who that instant entered the\r\nroom) here is the Gustavus you desire to see. I am the son of Agatha\r\nyour Laurina's 4th and youngest Daughter,\u201d \u201cI see you are indeed;\r\nreplied Lord St. Clair--But tell me (continued he looking fearfully\r\ntowards the Door) tell me, have I any other Grand-children in the\r\nHouse.\u201d \u201cNone my Lord.\u201d \u201cThen I will provide for you all without farther\r\ndelay--Here are 4 Banknotes of 50L each--Take them and remember I\r\nhave done the Duty of a Grandfather.\u201d He instantly left the Room and\r\nimmediately afterwards the House. Adeiu, Laura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the 12th LAURA in continuation\r\n\r\nYou may imagine how greatly we were surprised by the sudden departure\r\nof Lord St Clair. \u201cIgnoble Grand-sire!\u201d exclaimed Sophia. \u201cUnworthy\r\nGrandfather!\u201d said I, and instantly fainted in each other's arms. How\r\nlong we remained in this situation I know not; but when we recovered\r\nwe found ourselves alone, without either Gustavus, Philander, or the\r\nBanknotes. As we were deploring our unhappy fate, the Door of the\r\nApartment opened and \u201cMacdonald\u201d was announced. He was Sophia's cousin.\r\nThe haste with which he came to our releif so soon after the receipt\r\nof our Note, spoke so greatly in his favour that I hesitated not to\r\npronounce him at first sight, a tender and simpathetic Freind. Alas!\r\nhe little deserved the name--for though he told us that he was much\r\nconcerned at our Misfortunes, yet by his own account it appeared that\r\nthe perusal of them, had neither drawn from him a single sigh, nor\r\ninduced him to bestow one curse on our vindictive stars--. He told\r\nSophia that his Daughter depended on her returning with him to\r\nMacdonald-Hall, and that as his Cousin's freind he should be happy\r\nto see me there also. To Macdonald-Hall, therefore we went, and were\r\nreceived with great kindness by Janetta the Daughter of Macdonald, and\r\nthe Mistress of the Mansion. Janetta was then only fifteen; naturally\r\nwell disposed, endowed with a susceptible Heart, and a simpathetic\r\nDisposition, she might, had these amiable qualities been properly\r\nencouraged, have been an ornament to human Nature; but unfortunately her\r\nFather possessed not a soul sufficiently exalted to admire so promising\r\na Disposition, and had endeavoured by every means on his power\r\nto prevent it encreasing with her Years. He had actually so far\r\nextinguished the natural noble Sensibility of her Heart, as to prevail\r\non her to accept an offer from a young Man of his Recommendation. They\r\nwere to be married in a few months, and Graham, was in the House when\r\nwe arrived. WE soon saw through his character. He was just such a Man as\r\none might have expected to be the choice of Macdonald. They said he was\r\nSensible, well-informed, and Agreable; we did not pretend to Judge of\r\nsuch trifles, but as we were convinced he had no soul, that he had\r\nnever read the sorrows of Werter, and that his Hair bore not the least\r\nresemblance to auburn, we were certain that Janetta could feel no\r\naffection for him, or at least that she ought to feel none. The very\r\ncircumstance of his being her father's choice too, was so much in his\r\ndisfavour, that had he been deserving her, in every other respect yet\r\nTHAT of itself ought to have been a sufficient reason in the Eyes of\r\nJanetta for rejecting him. These considerations we were determined to\r\nrepresent to her in their proper light and doubted not of meeting with\r\nthe desired success from one naturally so well disposed; whose errors in\r\nthe affair had only arisen from a want of proper confidence in her own\r\nopinion, and a suitable contempt of her father's. We found her indeed\r\nall that our warmest wishes could have hoped for; we had no difficulty\r\nto convince her that it was impossible she could love Graham, or that it\r\nwas her Duty to disobey her Father; the only thing at which she rather\r\nseemed to hesitate was our assertion that she must be attached to some\r\nother Person. For some time, she persevered in declaring that she knew\r\nno other young man for whom she had the the smallest Affection; but upon\r\nexplaining the impossibility of such a thing she said that she beleived\r\nshe DID LIKE Captain M'Kenrie better than any one she knew besides. This\r\nconfession satisfied us and after having enumerated the good Qualities\r\nof M'Kenrie and assured her that she was violently in love with him, we\r\ndesired to know whether he had ever in any wise declared his affection\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo far from having ever declared it, I have no reason to imagine that\r\nhe has ever felt any for me.\u201d said Janetta. \u201cThat he certainly adores\r\nyou (replied Sophia) there can be no doubt--. The Attachment must be\r\nreciprocal. Did he never gaze on you with admiration--tenderly press\r\nyour hand--drop an involantary tear--and leave the room abruptly?\u201d\r\n \u201cNever (replied she) that I remember--he has always left the room indeed\r\nwhen his visit has been ended, but has never gone away particularly\r\nabruptly or without making a bow.\u201d Indeed my Love (said I) you must be\r\nmistaken--for it is absolutely impossible that he should ever have left\r\nyou but with Confusion, Despair, and Precipitation. Consider but for a\r\nmoment Janetta, and you must be convinced how absurd it is to suppose\r\nthat he could ever make a Bow, or behave like any other Person.\u201d\r\n Having settled this Point to our satisfaction, the next we took into\r\nconsideration was, to determine in what manner we should inform M'Kenrie\r\nof the favourable Opinion Janetta entertained of him.... We at length\r\nagreed to acquaint him with it by an anonymous Letter which Sophia drew\r\nup in the following manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! happy Lover of the beautifull Janetta, oh! amiable Possessor of\r\nHER Heart whose hand is destined to another, why do you thus delay a\r\nconfession of your attachment to the amiable Object of it? Oh! consider\r\nthat a few weeks will at once put an end to every flattering Hope that\r\nyou may now entertain, by uniting the unfortunate Victim of her father's\r\nCruelty to the execrable and detested Graham.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlas! why do you thus so cruelly connive at the projected Misery of\r\nher and of yourself by delaying to communicate that scheme which had\r\ndoubtless long possessed your imagination? A secret Union will at once\r\nsecure the felicity of both.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe amiable M'Kenrie, whose modesty as he afterwards assured us had\r\nbeen the only reason of his having so long concealed the violence of\r\nhis affection for Janetta, on receiving this Billet flew on the wings of\r\nLove to Macdonald-Hall, and so powerfully pleaded his Attachment to her\r\nwho inspired it, that after a few more private interveiws, Sophia and\r\nI experienced the satisfaction of seeing them depart for Gretna-Green,\r\nwhich they chose for the celebration of their Nuptials, in preference\r\nto any other place although it was at a considerable distance from\r\nMacdonald-Hall. Adeiu Laura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the 13th LAURA in continuation\r\n\r\nThey had been gone nearly a couple of Hours, before either Macdonald or\r\nGraham had entertained any suspicion of the affair. And they might not\r\neven then have suspected it, but for the following little Accident.\r\nSophia happening one day to open a private Drawer in Macdonald's Library\r\nwith one of her own keys, discovered that it was the Place where he\r\nkept his Papers of consequence and amongst them some bank notes of\r\nconsiderable amount. This discovery she imparted to me; and having\r\nagreed together that it would be a proper treatment of so vile a Wretch\r\nas Macdonald to deprive him of money, perhaps dishonestly gained, it was\r\ndetermined that the next time we should either of us happen to go that\r\nway, we would take one or more of the Bank notes from the drawer. This\r\nwell meant Plan we had often successfully put in Execution; but alas!\r\non the very day of Janetta's Escape, as Sophia was majestically removing\r\nthe 5th Bank-note from the Drawer to her own purse, she was suddenly\r\nmost impertinently interrupted in her employment by the entrance of\r\nMacdonald himself, in a most abrupt and precipitate Manner. Sophia (who\r\nthough naturally all winning sweetness could when occasions demanded it\r\ncall forth the Dignity of her sex) instantly put on a most forbidding\r\nlook, and darting an angry frown on the undaunted culprit, demanded in\r\na haughty tone of voice \u201cWherefore her retirement was thus insolently\r\nbroken in on?\u201d The unblushing Macdonald, without even endeavouring to\r\nexculpate himself from the crime he was charged with, meanly endeavoured\r\nto reproach Sophia with ignobly defrauding him of his money... The\r\ndignity of Sophia was wounded; \u201cWretch (exclaimed she, hastily replacing\r\nthe Bank-note in the Drawer) how darest thou to accuse me of an Act,\r\nof which the bare idea makes me blush?\u201d The base wretch was still\r\nunconvinced and continued to upbraid the justly-offended Sophia in such\r\nopprobious Language, that at length he so greatly provoked the gentle\r\nsweetness of her Nature, as to induce her to revenge herself on him by\r\ninforming him of Janetta's Elopement, and of the active Part we had\r\nboth taken in the affair. At this period of their Quarrel I entered the\r\nLibrary and was as you may imagine equally offended as Sophia at the\r\nill-grounded accusations of the malevolent and contemptible Macdonald.\r\n\u201cBase Miscreant! (cried I) how canst thou thus undauntedly endeavour to\r\nsully the spotless reputation of such bright Excellence? Why dost thou\r\nnot suspect MY innocence as soon?\u201d \u201cBe satisfied Madam (replied he) I\r\nDO suspect it, and therefore must desire that you will both leave this\r\nHouse in less than half an hour.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall go willingly; (answered Sophia) our hearts have long detested\r\nthee, and nothing but our freindship for thy Daughter could have induced\r\nus to remain so long beneath thy roof.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour Freindship for my Daughter has indeed been most powerfully exerted\r\nby throwing her into the arms of an unprincipled Fortune-hunter.\u201d\r\n (replied he)\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, (exclaimed I) amidst every misfortune, it will afford us some\r\nconsolation to reflect that by this one act of Freindship to Janetta,\r\nwe have amply discharged every obligation that we have received from her\r\nfather.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must indeed be a most gratefull reflection, to your exalted minds.\u201d\r\n (said he.)\r\n\r\nAs soon as we had packed up our wardrobe and valuables, we left\r\nMacdonald Hall, and after having walked about a mile and a half we\r\nsate down by the side of a clear limpid stream to refresh our exhausted\r\nlimbs. The place was suited to meditation. A grove of full-grown Elms\r\nsheltered us from the East--. A Bed of full-grown Nettles from the\r\nWest--. Before us ran the murmuring brook and behind us ran the\r\nturn-pike road. We were in a mood for contemplation and in a Disposition\r\nto enjoy so beautifull a spot. A mutual silence which had for some time\r\nreigned between us, was at length broke by my exclaiming--\u201cWhat a lovely\r\nscene! Alas why are not Edward and Augustus here to enjoy its Beauties\r\nwith us?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! my beloved Laura (cried Sophia) for pity's sake forbear recalling\r\nto my remembrance the unhappy situation of my imprisoned Husband. Alas,\r\nwhat would I not give to learn the fate of my Augustus! to know if he is\r\nstill in Newgate, or if he is yet hung. But never shall I be able so far\r\nto conquer my tender sensibility as to enquire after him. Oh! do not\r\nI beseech you ever let me again hear you repeat his beloved name--. It\r\naffects me too deeply--. I cannot bear to hear him mentioned it wounds\r\nmy feelings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me my Sophia for having thus unwillingly offended you--\u201d replied\r\nI--and then changing the conversation, desired her to admire the noble\r\nGrandeur of the Elms which sheltered us from the Eastern Zephyr. \u201cAlas!\r\nmy Laura (returned she) avoid so melancholy a subject, I intreat you.\r\nDo not again wound my Sensibility by observations on those elms. They\r\nremind me of Augustus. He was like them, tall, magestic--he possessed\r\nthat noble grandeur which you admire in them.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was silent, fearfull lest I might any more unwillingly distress her by\r\nfixing on any other subject of conversation which might again remind her\r\nof Augustus.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you not speak my Laura? (said she after a short pause) \u201cI cannot\r\nsupport this silence you must not leave me to my own reflections; they\r\never recur to Augustus.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a beautifull sky! (said I) How charmingly is the azure varied by\r\nthose delicate streaks of white!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! my Laura (replied she hastily withdrawing her Eyes from a momentary\r\nglance at the sky) do not thus distress me by calling my Attention to\r\nan object which so cruelly reminds me of my Augustus's blue sattin\r\nwaistcoat striped in white! In pity to your unhappy freind avoid a\r\nsubject so distressing.\u201d What could I do? The feelings of Sophia were\r\nat that time so exquisite, and the tenderness she felt for Augustus so\r\npoignant that I had not power to start any other topic, justly fearing\r\nthat it might in some unforseen manner again awaken all her sensibility\r\nby directing her thoughts to her Husband. Yet to be silent would be\r\ncruel; she had intreated me to talk.\r\n\r\nFrom this Dilemma I was most fortunately releived by an accident truly\r\napropos; it was the lucky overturning of a Gentleman's Phaeton, on the\r\nroad which ran murmuring behind us. It was a most fortunate accident\r\nas it diverted the attention of Sophia from the melancholy reflections\r\nwhich she had been before indulging. We instantly quitted our seats and\r\nran to the rescue of those who but a few moments before had been in so\r\nelevated a situation as a fashionably high Phaeton, but who were\r\nnow laid low and sprawling in the Dust. \u201cWhat an ample subject for\r\nreflection on the uncertain Enjoyments of this World, would not that\r\nPhaeton and the Life of Cardinal Wolsey afford a thinking Mind!\u201d said I\r\nto Sophia as we were hastening to the field of Action.\r\n\r\nShe had not time to answer me, for every thought was now engaged by the\r\nhorrid spectacle before us. Two Gentlemen most elegantly attired\r\nbut weltering in their blood was what first struck our Eyes--we\r\napproached--they were Edward and Augustus--. Yes dearest Marianne they\r\nwere our Husbands. Sophia shreiked and fainted on the ground--I screamed\r\nand instantly ran mad--. We remained thus mutually deprived of our\r\nsenses, some minutes, and on regaining them were deprived of them\r\nagain. For an Hour and a Quarter did we continue in this unfortunate\r\nsituation--Sophia fainting every moment and I running mad as often. At\r\nlength a groan from the hapless Edward (who alone retained any share\r\nof life) restored us to ourselves. Had we indeed before imagined that\r\neither of them lived, we should have been more sparing of our Greif--but\r\nas we had supposed when we first beheld them that they were no more,\r\nwe knew that nothing could remain to be done but what we were about.\r\nNo sooner did we therefore hear my Edward's groan than postponing our\r\nlamentations for the present, we hastily ran to the Dear Youth and\r\nkneeling on each side of him implored him not to die--. \u201cLaura (said He\r\nfixing his now languid Eyes on me) I fear I have been overturned.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was overjoyed to find him yet sensible.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! tell me Edward (said I) tell me I beseech you before you die, what\r\nhas befallen you since that unhappy Day in which Augustus was arrested\r\nand we were separated--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will\u201d (said he) and instantly fetching a deep sigh, Expired--. Sophia\r\nimmediately sank again into a swoon--. MY greif was more audible. My\r\nVoice faltered, My Eyes assumed a vacant stare, my face became as pale\r\nas Death, and my senses were considerably impaired--.\r\n\r\n\u201cTalk not to me of Phaetons (said I, raving in a frantic, incoherent\r\nmanner)--Give me a violin--. I'll play to him and sooth him in his\r\nmelancholy Hours--Beware ye gentle Nymphs of Cupid's Thunderbolts, avoid\r\nthe piercing shafts of Jupiter--Look at that grove of Firs--I see a Leg\r\nof Mutton--They told me Edward was not Dead; but they deceived me--they\r\ntook him for a cucumber--\u201d Thus I continued wildly exclaiming on my\r\nEdward's Death--. For two Hours did I rave thus madly and should not\r\nthen have left off, as I was not in the least fatigued, had not Sophia\r\nwho was just recovered from her swoon, intreated me to consider that\r\nNight was now approaching and that the Damps began to fall. \u201cAnd\r\nwhither shall we go (said I) to shelter us from either?\u201d \u201cTo that white\r\nCottage.\u201d (replied she pointing to a neat Building which rose up amidst\r\nthe grove of Elms and which I had not before observed--) I agreed and we\r\ninstantly walked to it--we knocked at the door--it was opened by an old\r\nwoman; on being requested to afford us a Night's Lodging, she informed\r\nus that her House was but small, that she had only two Bedrooms, but\r\nthat However we should be wellcome to one of them. We were satisfied and\r\nfollowed the good woman into the House where we were greatly cheered\r\nby the sight of a comfortable fire--. She was a widow and had only one\r\nDaughter, who was then just seventeen--One of the best of ages; but\r\nalas! she was very plain and her name was Bridget..... Nothing therfore\r\ncould be expected from her--she could not be supposed to possess either\r\nexalted Ideas, Delicate Feelings or refined Sensibilities--. She was\r\nnothing more than a mere good-tempered, civil and obliging young woman;\r\nas such we could scarcely dislike here--she was only an Object of\r\nContempt--. Adeiu Laura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the 14th LAURA in continuation\r\n\r\nArm yourself my amiable young Freind with all the philosophy you are\r\nMistress of; summon up all the fortitude you possess, for alas! in the\r\nperusal of the following Pages your sensibility will be most severely\r\ntried. Ah! what were the misfortunes I had before experienced and which\r\nI have already related to you, to the one I am now going to inform you\r\nof. The Death of my Father and my Mother and my Husband though almost\r\nmore than my gentle Nature could support, were trifles in comparison\r\nto the misfortune I am now proceeding to relate. The morning after\r\nour arrival at the Cottage, Sophia complained of a violent pain in her\r\ndelicate limbs, accompanied with a disagreable Head-ake She attributed\r\nit to a cold caught by her continued faintings in the open air as the\r\nDew was falling the Evening before. This I feared was but too probably\r\nthe case; since how could it be otherwise accounted for that I should\r\nhave escaped the same indisposition, but by supposing that the\r\nbodily Exertions I had undergone in my repeated fits of frenzy had so\r\neffectually circulated and warmed my Blood as to make me proof against\r\nthe chilling Damps of Night, whereas, Sophia lying totally inactive\r\non the ground must have been exposed to all their severity. I was most\r\nseriously alarmed by her illness which trifling as it may appear to\r\nyou, a certain instinctive sensibility whispered me, would in the End be\r\nfatal to her.\r\n\r\nAlas! my fears were but too fully justified; she grew gradually\r\nworse--and I daily became more alarmed for her. At length she was\r\nobliged to confine herself solely to the Bed allotted us by our worthy\r\nLandlady--. Her disorder turned to a galloping Consumption and in a few\r\ndays carried her off. Amidst all my Lamentations for her (and violent\r\nyou may suppose they were) I yet received some consolation in the\r\nreflection of my having paid every attention to her, that could be\r\noffered, in her illness. I had wept over her every Day--had bathed her\r\nsweet face with my tears and had pressed her fair Hands continually in\r\nmine--. \u201cMy beloved Laura (said she to me a few Hours before she died)\r\ntake warning from my unhappy End and avoid the imprudent conduct which\r\nhad occasioned it... Beware of fainting-fits... Though at the time they\r\nmay be refreshing and agreable yet beleive me they will in the end, if\r\ntoo often repeated and at improper seasons, prove destructive to your\r\nConstitution... My fate will teach you this.. I die a Martyr to my greif\r\nfor the loss of Augustus.. One fatal swoon has cost me my Life.. Beware\r\nof swoons Dear Laura.... A frenzy fit is not one quarter so pernicious;\r\nit is an exercise to the Body and if not too violent, is I dare say\r\nconducive to Health in its consequences--Run mad as often as you chuse;\r\nbut do not faint--\u201d\r\n\r\nThese were the last words she ever addressed to me.. It was her dieing\r\nAdvice to her afflicted Laura, who has ever most faithfully adhered to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAfter having attended my lamented freind to her Early Grave, I\r\nimmediately (tho' late at night) left the detested Village in which\r\nshe died, and near which had expired my Husband and Augustus. I had not\r\nwalked many yards from it before I was overtaken by a stage-coach,\r\nin which I instantly took a place, determined to proceed in it to\r\nEdinburgh, where I hoped to find some kind some pitying Freind who would\r\nreceive and comfort me in my afflictions.\r\n\r\nIt was so dark when I entered the Coach that I could not distinguish\r\nthe Number of my Fellow-travellers; I could only perceive that they were\r\nmany. Regardless however of anything concerning them, I gave myself up\r\nto my own sad Reflections. A general silence prevailed--A silence, which\r\nwas by nothing interrupted but by the loud and repeated snores of one of\r\nthe Party.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat an illiterate villain must that man be! (thought I to myself) What\r\na total want of delicate refinement must he have, who can thus shock our\r\nsenses by such a brutal noise! He must I am certain be capable of every\r\nbad action! There is no crime too black for such a Character!\u201d Thus\r\nreasoned I within myself, and doubtless such were the reflections of my\r\nfellow travellers.\r\n\r\nAt length, returning Day enabled me to behold the unprincipled Scoundrel\r\nwho had so violently disturbed my feelings. It was Sir Edward the father\r\nof my Deceased Husband. By his side sate Augusta, and on the same seat\r\nwith me were your Mother and Lady Dorothea. Imagine my surprise at\r\nfinding myself thus seated amongst my old Acquaintance. Great as was my\r\nastonishment, it was yet increased, when on looking out of Windows,\r\nI beheld the Husband of Philippa, with Philippa by his side, on the\r\nCoachbox and when on looking behind I beheld, Philander and Gustavus in\r\nthe Basket. \u201cOh! Heavens, (exclaimed I) is it possible that I should\r\nso unexpectedly be surrounded by my nearest Relations and Connections?\u201d\r\n These words roused the rest of the Party, and every eye was directed to\r\nthe corner in which I sat. \u201cOh! my Isabel (continued I throwing myself\r\nacross Lady Dorothea into her arms) receive once more to your Bosom the\r\nunfortunate Laura. Alas! when we last parted in the Vale of Usk, I was\r\nhappy in being united to the best of Edwards; I had then a Father and\r\na Mother, and had never known misfortunes--But now deprived of every\r\nfreind but you--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! (interrupted Augusta) is my Brother dead then? Tell us I intreat\r\nyou what is become of him?\u201d \u201cYes, cold and insensible Nymph, (replied I)\r\nthat luckless swain your Brother, is no more, and you may now glory in\r\nbeing the Heiress of Sir Edward's fortune.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough I had always despised her from the Day I had overheard her\r\nconversation with my Edward, yet in civility I complied with hers and\r\nSir Edward's intreaties that I would inform them of the whole melancholy\r\naffair. They were greatly shocked--even the obdurate Heart of Sir Edward\r\nand the insensible one of Augusta, were touched with sorrow, by the\r\nunhappy tale. At the request of your Mother I related to them every\r\nother misfortune which had befallen me since we parted. Of the\r\nimprisonment of Augustus and the absence of Edward--of our arrival\r\nin Scotland--of our unexpected Meeting with our Grand-father and our\r\ncousins--of our visit to Macdonald-Hall--of the singular service we\r\nthere performed towards Janetta--of her Fathers ingratitude for it.. of\r\nhis inhuman Behaviour, unaccountable suspicions, and barbarous treatment\r\nof us, in obliging us to leave the House.. of our lamentations on the\r\nloss of Edward and Augustus and finally of the melancholy Death of my\r\nbeloved Companion.\r\n\r\nPity and surprise were strongly depictured in your Mother's countenance,\r\nduring the whole of my narration, but I am sorry to say, that to the\r\neternal reproach of her sensibility, the latter infinitely predominated.\r\nNay, faultless as my conduct had certainly been during the whole course\r\nof my late misfortunes and adventures, she pretended to find fault with\r\nmy behaviour in many of the situations in which I had been placed. As\r\nI was sensible myself, that I had always behaved in a manner which\r\nreflected Honour on my Feelings and Refinement, I paid little attention\r\nto what she said, and desired her to satisfy my Curiosity by informing\r\nme how she came there, instead of wounding my spotless reputation with\r\nunjustifiable Reproaches. As soon as she had complyed with my wishes in\r\nthis particular and had given me an accurate detail of every thing that\r\nhad befallen her since our separation (the particulars of which if you\r\nare not already acquainted with, your Mother will give you) I applied to\r\nAugusta for the same information respecting herself, Sir Edward and Lady\r\nDorothea.\r\n\r\nShe told me that having a considerable taste for the Beauties of Nature,\r\nher curiosity to behold the delightful scenes it exhibited in that part\r\nof the World had been so much raised by Gilpin's Tour to the Highlands,\r\nthat she had prevailed on her Father to undertake a Tour to Scotland and\r\nhad persuaded Lady Dorothea to accompany them. That they had arrived at\r\nEdinburgh a few Days before and from thence had made daily Excursions\r\ninto the Country around in the Stage Coach they were then in, from one\r\nof which Excursions they were at that time returning. My next enquiries\r\nwere concerning Philippa and her Husband, the latter of whom I learned\r\nhaving spent all her fortune, had recourse for subsistence to the talent\r\nin which, he had always most excelled, namely, Driving, and that\r\nhaving sold every thing which belonged to them except their Coach, had\r\nconverted it into a Stage and in order to be removed from any of his\r\nformer Acquaintance, had driven it to Edinburgh from whence he went to\r\nSterling every other Day. That Philippa still retaining her affection\r\nfor her ungratefull Husband, had followed him to Scotland and generally\r\naccompanied him in his little Excursions to Sterling. \u201cIt has only been\r\nto throw a little money into their Pockets (continued Augusta) that my\r\nFather has always travelled in their Coach to veiw the beauties of the\r\nCountry since our arrival in Scotland--for it would certainly have been\r\nmuch more agreable to us, to visit the Highlands in a Postchaise\r\nthan merely to travel from Edinburgh to Sterling and from Sterling\r\nto Edinburgh every other Day in a crowded and uncomfortable Stage.\u201d I\r\nperfectly agreed with her in her sentiments on the affair, and secretly\r\nblamed Sir Edward for thus sacrificing his Daughter's Pleasure for the\r\nsake of a ridiculous old woman whose folly in marrying so young a man\r\nought to be punished. His Behaviour however was entirely of a peice\r\nwith his general Character; for what could be expected from a man who\r\npossessed not the smallest atom of Sensibility, who scarcely knew the\r\nmeaning of simpathy, and who actually snored--. Adeiu Laura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the 15th LAURA in continuation.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the town where we were to Breakfast, I was determined\r\nto speak with Philander and Gustavus, and to that purpose as soon as\r\nI left the Carriage, I went to the Basket and tenderly enquired after\r\ntheir Health, expressing my fears of the uneasiness of their situation.\r\nAt first they seemed rather confused at my appearance dreading no doubt\r\nthat I might call them to account for the money which our Grandfather\r\nhad left me and which they had unjustly deprived me of, but finding\r\nthat I mentioned nothing of the Matter, they desired me to step into\r\nthe Basket as we might there converse with greater ease. Accordingly I\r\nentered and whilst the rest of the party were devouring green tea and\r\nbuttered toast, we feasted ourselves in a more refined and sentimental\r\nManner by a confidential Conversation. I informed them of every thing\r\nwhich had befallen me during the course of my life, and at my request\r\nthey related to me every incident of theirs.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are the sons as you already know, of the two youngest Daughters\r\nwhich Lord St Clair had by Laurina an italian opera girl. Our mothers\r\ncould neither of them exactly ascertain who were our Father, though it\r\nis generally beleived that Philander, is the son of one Philip Jones\r\na Bricklayer and that my Father was one Gregory Staves a Staymaker of\r\nEdinburgh. This is however of little consequence for as our Mothers were\r\ncertainly never married to either of them it reflects no Dishonour on\r\nour Blood, which is of a most ancient and unpolluted kind. Bertha (the\r\nMother of Philander) and Agatha (my own Mother) always lived together.\r\nThey were neither of them very rich; their united fortunes had\r\noriginally amounted to nine thousand Pounds, but as they had always\r\nlived on the principal of it, when we were fifteen it was diminished to\r\nnine Hundred. This nine Hundred they always kept in a Drawer in one\r\nof the Tables which stood in our common sitting Parlour, for the\r\nconvenience of having it always at Hand. Whether it was from this\r\ncircumstance, of its being easily taken, or from a wish of being\r\nindependant, or from an excess of sensibility (for which we were always\r\nremarkable) I cannot now determine, but certain it is that when we had\r\nreached our 15th year, we took the nine Hundred Pounds and ran away.\r\nHaving obtained this prize we were determined to manage it with eoconomy\r\nand not to spend it either with folly or Extravagance. To this purpose\r\nwe therefore divided it into nine parcels, one of which we devoted to\r\nVictuals, the 2d to Drink, the 3d to Housekeeping, the 4th to Carriages,\r\nthe 5th to Horses, the 6th to Servants, the 7th to Amusements, the 8th\r\nto Cloathes and the 9th to Silver Buckles. Having thus arranged our\r\nExpences for two months (for we expected to make the nine Hundred Pounds\r\nlast as long) we hastened to London and had the good luck to spend it in\r\n7 weeks and a Day which was 6 Days sooner than we had intended. As soon\r\nas we had thus happily disencumbered ourselves from the weight of\r\nso much money, we began to think of returning to our Mothers, but\r\naccidentally hearing that they were both starved to Death, we gave over\r\nthe design and determined to engage ourselves to some strolling Company\r\nof Players, as we had always a turn for the Stage. Accordingly we\r\noffered our services to one and were accepted; our Company was\r\nindeed rather small, as it consisted only of the Manager his wife\r\nand ourselves, but there were fewer to pay and the only inconvenience\r\nattending it was the Scarcity of Plays which for want of People to fill\r\nthe Characters, we could perform. We did not mind trifles however--.\r\nOne of our most admired Performances was MACBETH, in which we were\r\ntruly great. The Manager always played BANQUO himself, his Wife my LADY\r\nMACBETH. I did the THREE WITCHES and Philander acted ALL THE REST. To\r\nsay the truth this tragedy was not only the Best, but the only Play\r\nthat we ever performed; and after having acted it all over England, and\r\nWales, we came to Scotland to exhibit it over the remainder of Great\r\nBritain. We happened to be quartered in that very Town, where you came\r\nand met your Grandfather--. We were in the Inn-yard when his Carriage\r\nentered and perceiving by the arms to whom it belonged, and knowing\r\nthat Lord St Clair was our Grandfather, we agreed to endeavour to get\r\nsomething from him by discovering the Relationship--. You know how well\r\nit succeeded--. Having obtained the two Hundred Pounds, we instantly\r\nleft the Town, leaving our Manager and his Wife to act MACBETH by\r\nthemselves, and took the road to Sterling, where we spent our little\r\nfortune with great ECLAT. We are now returning to Edinburgh in order to\r\nget some preferment in the Acting way; and such my Dear Cousin is our\r\nHistory.\u201d\r\n\r\nI thanked the amiable Youth for his entertaining narration, and after\r\nexpressing my wishes for their Welfare and Happiness, left them in\r\ntheir little Habitation and returned to my other Freinds who impatiently\r\nexpected me.\r\n\r\nMy adventures are now drawing to a close my dearest Marianne; at least\r\nfor the present.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at Edinburgh Sir Edward told me that as the Widow of his\r\nson, he desired I would accept from his Hands of four Hundred a year. I\r\ngraciously promised that I would, but could not help observing that the\r\nunsimpathetic Baronet offered it more on account of my being the Widow\r\nof Edward than in being the refined and amiable Laura.\r\n\r\nI took up my Residence in a Romantic Village in the Highlands\r\nof Scotland where I have ever since continued, and where I can\r\nuninterrupted by unmeaning Visits, indulge in a melancholy solitude, my\r\nunceasing Lamentations for the Death of my Father, my Mother, my Husband\r\nand my Freind.\r\n\r\nAugusta has been for several years united to Graham the Man of all\r\nothers most suited to her; she became acquainted with him during her\r\nstay in Scotland.\r\n\r\nSir Edward in hopes of gaining an Heir to his Title and Estate, at the\r\nsame time married Lady Dorothea--. His wishes have been answered.\r\n\r\nPhilander and Gustavus, after having raised their reputation by their\r\nPerformances in the Theatrical Line at Edinburgh, removed to Covent\r\nGarden, where they still exhibit under the assumed names of LUVIS and\r\nQUICK.\r\n\r\nPhilippa has long paid the Debt of Nature, Her Husband however still\r\ncontinues to drive the Stage-Coach from Edinburgh to Sterling:--Adeiu my\r\nDearest Marianne. Laura.\r\n\r\nFinis\r\n\r\nJune 13th 1790.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN UNFINISHED NOVEL IN LETTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nTo HENRY THOMAS AUSTEN Esqre.\r\n\r\nSir\r\n\r\nI am now availing myself of the Liberty you have frequently honoured\r\nme with of dedicating one of my Novels to you.

Lesley Castle Janry 3rd--1792.\r\n\r\nMy Brother has just left us. \u201cMatilda (said he at parting) you and\r\nMargaret will I am certain take all the care of my dear little one, that\r\nshe might have received from an indulgent, and affectionate and amiable\r\nMother.\u201d Tears rolled down his cheeks as he spoke these words--the\r\nremembrance of her, who had so wantonly disgraced the Maternal character\r\nand so openly violated the conjugal Duties, prevented his adding\r\nanything farther; he embraced his sweet Child and after saluting Matilda\r\nand Me hastily broke from us and seating himself in his Chaise, pursued\r\nthe road to Aberdeen. Never was there a better young Man! Ah! how little\r\ndid he deserve the misfortunes he has experienced in the Marriage state.\r\nSo good a Husband to so bad a Wife! for you know my dear Charlotte that\r\nthe Worthless Louisa left him, her Child and reputation a few weeks ago\r\nin company with Danvers and dishonour. Never was there a sweeter face, a\r\nfiner form, or a less amiable Heart than Louisa owned! Her child already\r\npossesses the personal Charms of her unhappy Mother! May she inherit\r\nfrom her Father all his mental ones! Lesley is at present but five and\r\ntwenty, and has already given himself up to melancholy and Despair;\r\nwhat a difference between him and his Father! Sir George is 57 and still\r\nremains the Beau, the flighty stripling, the gay Lad, and sprightly\r\nYoungster, that his Son was really about five years back, and that HE\r\nhas affected to appear ever since my remembrance. While our father is\r\nfluttering about the streets of London, gay, dissipated, and Thoughtless\r\nat the age of 57, Matilda and I continue secluded from Mankind in our\r\nold and Mouldering Castle, which is situated two miles from Perth on a\r\nbold projecting Rock, and commands an extensive veiw of the Town and its\r\ndelightful Environs. But tho' retired from almost all the World, (for\r\nwe visit no one but the M'Leods, The M'Kenzies, the M'Phersons, the\r\nM'Cartneys, the M'Donalds, The M'kinnons, the M'lellans, the M'kays,\r\nthe Macbeths and the Macduffs) we are neither dull nor unhappy; on the\r\ncontrary there never were two more lively, more agreable or more witty\r\ngirls, than we are; not an hour in the Day hangs heavy on our Hands. We\r\nread, we work, we walk, and when fatigued with these Employments releive\r\nour spirits, either by a lively song, a graceful Dance, or by some smart\r\nbon-mot, and witty repartee. We are handsome my dear Charlotte, very\r\nhandsome and the greatest of our Perfections is, that we are entirely\r\ninsensible of them ourselves. But why do I thus dwell on myself! Let me\r\nrather repeat the praise of our dear little Neice the innocent Louisa,\r\nwho is at present sweetly smiling in a gentle Nap, as she reposes on the\r\nsofa. The dear Creature is just turned of two years old; as handsome as\r\ntho' 2 and 20, as sensible as tho' 2 and 30, and as prudent as tho' 2\r\nand 40. To convince you of this, I must inform you that she has a very\r\nfine complexion and very pretty features, that she already knows the two\r\nfirst letters in the Alphabet, and that she never tears her frocks--. If\r\nI have not now convinced you of her Beauty, Sense and Prudence, I have\r\nnothing more to urge in support of my assertion, and you will therefore\r\nhave no way of deciding the Affair but by coming to Lesley-Castle, and\r\nby a personal acquaintance with Louisa, determine for yourself. Ah! my\r\ndear Freind, how happy should I be to see you within these venerable\r\nWalls! It is now four years since my removal from School has separated\r\nme from you; that two such tender Hearts, so closely linked together by\r\nthe ties of simpathy and Freindship, should be so widely removed from\r\neach other, is vastly moving. I live in Perthshire, You in Sussex. We\r\nmight meet in London, were my Father disposed to carry me there, and\r\nwere your Mother to be there at the same time. We might meet at Bath,\r\nat Tunbridge, or anywhere else indeed, could we but be at the same place\r\ntogether. We have only to hope that such a period may arrive. My Father\r\ndoes not return to us till Autumn; my Brother will leave Scotland in a\r\nfew Days; he is impatient to travel. Mistaken Youth! He vainly flatters\r\nhimself that change of Air will heal the Wounds of a broken Heart! You\r\nwill join with me I am certain my dear Charlotte, in prayers for the\r\nrecovery of the unhappy Lesley's peace of Mind, which must ever be\r\nessential to that of your sincere freind M. Lesley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the SECOND From Miss C. LUTTERELL to Miss M. LESLEY in answer.\r\nGlenford Febry 12\r\n\r\nI have a thousand excuses to beg for having so long delayed thanking you\r\nmy dear Peggy for your agreable Letter, which beleive me I should not\r\nhave deferred doing, had not every moment of my time during the last\r\nfive weeks been so fully employed in the necessary arrangements for\r\nmy sisters wedding, as to allow me no time to devote either to you or\r\nmyself. And now what provokes me more than anything else is that the\r\nMatch is broke off, and all my Labour thrown away. Imagine how great\r\nthe Dissapointment must be to me, when you consider that after having\r\nlaboured both by Night and by Day, in order to get the Wedding dinner\r\nready by the time appointed, after having roasted Beef, Broiled Mutton,\r\nand Stewed Soup enough to last the new-married Couple through the\r\nHoney-moon, I had the mortification of finding that I had been Roasting,\r\nBroiling and Stewing both the Meat and Myself to no purpose. Indeed my\r\ndear Freind, I never remember suffering any vexation equal to what I\r\nexperienced on last Monday when my sister came running to me in the\r\nstore-room with her face as White as a Whipt syllabub, and told me that\r\nHervey had been thrown from his Horse, had fractured his Scull and was\r\npronounced by his surgeon to be in the most emminent Danger. \u201cGood God!\r\n(said I) you dont say so? Why what in the name of Heaven will become\r\nof all the Victuals! We shall never be able to eat it while it is good.\r\nHowever, we'll call in the Surgeon to help us. I shall be able to manage\r\nthe Sir-loin myself, my Mother will eat the soup, and You and the Doctor\r\nmust finish the rest.\u201d Here I was interrupted, by seeing my poor Sister\r\nfall down to appearance Lifeless upon one of the Chests, where we keep\r\nour Table linen. I immediately called my Mother and the Maids, and at\r\nlast we brought her to herself again; as soon as ever she was sensible,\r\nshe expressed a determination of going instantly to Henry, and was so\r\nwildly bent on this Scheme, that we had the greatest Difficulty in the\r\nWorld to prevent her putting it in execution; at last however more by\r\nForce than Entreaty we prevailed on her to go into her room; we laid\r\nher upon the Bed, and she continued for some Hours in the most dreadful\r\nConvulsions. My Mother and I continued in the room with her, and when\r\nany intervals of tolerable Composure in Eloisa would allow us, we joined\r\nin heartfelt lamentations on the dreadful Waste in our provisions which\r\nthis Event must occasion, and in concerting some plan for getting rid of\r\nthem. We agreed that the best thing we could do was to begin eating them\r\nimmediately, and accordingly we ordered up the cold Ham and Fowls, and\r\ninstantly began our Devouring Plan on them with great Alacrity. We would\r\nhave persuaded Eloisa to have taken a Wing of a Chicken, but she would\r\nnot be persuaded. She was however much quieter than she had been;\r\nthe convulsions she had before suffered having given way to an almost\r\nperfect Insensibility. We endeavoured to rouse her by every means in our\r\npower, but to no purpose. I talked to her of Henry. \u201cDear Eloisa (said\r\nI) there's no occasion for your crying so much about such a trifle. (for\r\nI was willing to make light of it in order to comfort her) I beg you\r\nwould not mind it--You see it does not vex me in the least; though\r\nperhaps I may suffer most from it after all; for I shall not only be\r\nobliged to eat up all the Victuals I have dressed already, but must if\r\nHenry should recover (which however is not very likely) dress as much\r\nfor you again; or should he die (as I suppose he will) I shall still\r\nhave to prepare a Dinner for you whenever you marry any one else. So\r\nyou see that tho' perhaps for the present it may afflict you to think\r\nof Henry's sufferings, Yet I dare say he'll die soon, and then his pain\r\nwill be over and you will be easy, whereas my Trouble will last much\r\nlonger for work as hard as I may, I am certain that the pantry cannot be\r\ncleared in less than a fortnight.\u201d Thus I did all in my power to console\r\nher, but without any effect, and at last as I saw that she did not seem\r\nto listen to me, I said no more, but leaving her with my Mother I took\r\ndown the remains of The Ham and Chicken, and sent William to ask how\r\nHenry did. He was not expected to live many Hours; he died the same day.\r\nWe took all possible care to break the melancholy Event to Eloisa in the\r\ntenderest manner; yet in spite of every precaution, her sufferings on\r\nhearing it were too violent for her reason, and she continued for many\r\nhours in a high Delirium. She is still extremely ill, and her Physicians\r\nare greatly afraid of her going into a Decline. We are therefore\r\npreparing for Bristol, where we mean to be in the course of the next\r\nweek. And now my dear Margaret let me talk a little of your affairs; and\r\nin the first place I must inform you that it is confidently reported,\r\nyour Father is going to be married; I am very unwilling to beleive so\r\nunpleasing a report, and at the same time cannot wholly discredit it. I\r\nhave written to my freind Susan Fitzgerald, for information concerning\r\nit, which as she is at present in Town, she will be very able to give\r\nme. I know not who is the Lady. I think your Brother is extremely\r\nright in the resolution he has taken of travelling, as it will perhaps\r\ncontribute to obliterate from his remembrance, those disagreable Events,\r\nwhich have lately so much afflicted him--I am happy to find that\r\ntho' secluded from all the World, neither you nor Matilda are dull or\r\nunhappy--that you may never know what it is to, be either is the wish of\r\nyour sincerely affectionate C.L.\r\n\r\nP. S. I have this instant received an answer from my freind Susan, which\r\nI enclose to you, and on which you will make your own reflections.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed LETTER\r\n\r\nMy dear CHARLOTTE You could not have applied for information concerning\r\nthe report of Sir George Lesleys Marriage, to any one better able to\r\ngive it you than I am. Sir George is certainly married; I was myself\r\npresent at the Ceremony, which you will not be surprised at when I\r\nsubscribe myself your Affectionate Susan Lesley\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the THIRD From Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss C. LUTTERELL Lesley\r\nCastle February the 16th\r\n\r\nI have made my own reflections on the letter you enclosed to me, my\r\nDear Charlotte and I will now tell you what those reflections were.\r\nI reflected that if by this second Marriage Sir George should have a\r\nsecond family, our fortunes must be considerably diminushed--that if\r\nhis Wife should be of an extravagant turn, she would encourage him\r\nto persevere in that gay and Dissipated way of Life to which little\r\nencouragement would be necessary, and which has I fear already proved\r\nbut too detrimental to his health and fortune--that she would now become\r\nMistress of those Jewels which once adorned our Mother, and which Sir\r\nGeorge had always promised us--that if they did not come into\r\nPerthshire I should not be able to gratify my curiosity of beholding my\r\nMother-in-law and that if they did, Matilda would no longer sit at\r\nthe head of her Father's table--. These my dear Charlotte were the\r\nmelancholy reflections which crowded into my imagination after perusing\r\nSusan's letter to you, and which instantly occurred to Matilda when she\r\nhad perused it likewise. The same ideas, the same fears, immediately\r\noccupied her Mind, and I know not which reflection distressed her most,\r\nwhether the probable Diminution of our Fortunes, or her own Consequence.\r\nWe both wish very much to know whether Lady Lesley is handsome and what\r\nis your opinion of her; as you honour her with the appellation of your\r\nfreind, we flatter ourselves that she must be amiable. My Brother is\r\nalready in Paris. He intends to quit it in a few Days, and to begin his\r\nroute to Italy. He writes in a most chearfull manner, says that the air\r\nof France has greatly recovered both his Health and Spirits; that he has\r\nnow entirely ceased to think of Louisa with any degree either of Pity or\r\nAffection, that he even feels himself obliged to her for her Elopement,\r\nas he thinks it very good fun to be single again. By this, you may\r\nperceive that he has entirely regained that chearful Gaiety, and\r\nsprightly Wit, for which he was once so remarkable. When he first became\r\nacquainted with Louisa which was little more than three years ago, he\r\nwas one of the most lively, the most agreable young Men of the age--.\r\nI beleive you never yet heard the particulars of his first acquaintance\r\nwith her. It commenced at our cousin Colonel Drummond's; at whose house\r\nin Cumberland he spent the Christmas, in which he attained the age of\r\ntwo and twenty. Louisa Burton was the Daughter of a distant Relation of\r\nMrs. Drummond, who dieing a few Months before in extreme poverty, left\r\nhis only Child then about eighteen to the protection of any of his\r\nRelations who would protect her. Mrs. Drummond was the only one who\r\nfound herself so disposed--Louisa was therefore removed from a miserable\r\nCottage in Yorkshire to an elegant Mansion in Cumberland, and from\r\nevery pecuniary Distress that Poverty could inflict, to every elegant\r\nEnjoyment that Money could purchase--. Louisa was naturally ill-tempered\r\nand Cunning; but she had been taught to disguise her real Disposition,\r\nunder the appearance of insinuating Sweetness, by a father who but too\r\nwell knew, that to be married, would be the only chance she would\r\nhave of not being starved, and who flattered himself that with such\r\nan extroidinary share of personal beauty, joined to a gentleness of\r\nManners, and an engaging address, she might stand a good chance of\r\npleasing some young Man who might afford to marry a girl without a\r\nShilling. Louisa perfectly entered into her father's schemes and was\r\ndetermined to forward them with all her care and attention. By dint of\r\nPerseverance and Application, she had at length so thoroughly disguised\r\nher natural disposition under the mask of Innocence, and Softness, as to\r\nimpose upon every one who had not by a long and constant intimacy with\r\nher discovered her real Character. Such was Louisa when the hapless\r\nLesley first beheld her at Drummond-house. His heart which (to use\r\nyour favourite comparison) was as delicate as sweet and as tender as a\r\nWhipt-syllabub, could not resist her attractions. In a very few Days,\r\nhe was falling in love, shortly after actually fell, and before he had\r\nknown her a Month, he had married her. My Father was at first highly\r\ndispleased at so hasty and imprudent a connection; but when he found\r\nthat they did not mind it, he soon became perfectly reconciled to the\r\nmatch. The Estate near Aberdeen which my brother possesses by the bounty\r\nof his great Uncle independant of Sir George, was entirely sufficient\r\nto support him and my Sister in Elegance and Ease. For the first\r\ntwelvemonth, no one could be happier than Lesley, and no one more\r\namiable to appearance than Louisa, and so plausibly did she act and\r\nso cautiously behave that tho' Matilda and I often spent several weeks\r\ntogether with them, yet we neither of us had any suspicion of her real\r\nDisposition. After the birth of Louisa however, which one would have\r\nthought would have strengthened her regard for Lesley, the mask she had\r\nso long supported was by degrees thrown aside, and as probably she then\r\nthought herself secure in the affection of her Husband (which did indeed\r\nappear if possible augmented by the birth of his Child) she seemed\r\nto take no pains to prevent that affection from ever diminushing. Our\r\nvisits therefore to Dunbeath, were now less frequent and by far less\r\nagreable than they used to be. Our absence was however never either\r\nmentioned or lamented by Louisa who in the society of young Danvers\r\nwith whom she became acquainted at Aberdeen (he was at one of the\r\nUniversities there,) felt infinitely happier than in that of Matilda and\r\nyour freind, tho' there certainly never were pleasanter girls than we\r\nare. You know the sad end of all Lesleys connubial happiness; I will not\r\nrepeat it--. Adeiu my dear Charlotte; although I have not yet mentioned\r\nanything of the matter, I hope you will do me the justice to beleive\r\nthat I THINK and FEEL, a great deal for your Sisters affliction. I do\r\nnot doubt but that the healthy air of the Bristol downs will intirely\r\nremove it, by erasing from her Mind the remembrance of Henry. I am my\r\ndear Charlotte yrs ever M. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the FOURTH From Miss C. LUTTERELL to Miss M. LESLEY Bristol\r\nFebruary 27th\r\n\r\nMy Dear Peggy I have but just received your letter, which being directed\r\nto Sussex while I was at Bristol was obliged to be forwarded to me here,\r\nand from some unaccountable Delay, has but this instant reached me--.\r\nI return you many thanks for the account it contains of Lesley's\r\nacquaintance, Love and Marriage with Louisa, which has not the less\r\nentertained me for having often been repeated to me before.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction of informing you that we have every reason to\r\nimagine our pantry is by this time nearly cleared, as we left Particular\r\norders with the servants to eat as hard as they possibly could, and to\r\ncall in a couple of Chairwomen to assist them. We brought a cold Pigeon\r\npye, a cold turkey, a cold tongue, and half a dozen Jellies with us,\r\nwhich we were lucky enough with the help of our Landlady, her husband,\r\nand their three children, to get rid of, in less than two days after\r\nour arrival. Poor Eloisa is still so very indifferent both in Health and\r\nSpirits, that I very much fear, the air of the Bristol downs, healthy as\r\nit is, has not been able to drive poor Henry from her remembrance.\r\n\r\nYou ask me whether your new Mother in law is handsome and amiable--I\r\nwill now give you an exact description of her bodily and mental charms.\r\nShe is short, and extremely well made; is naturally pale, but rouges a\r\ngood deal; has fine eyes, and fine teeth, as she will take care to let\r\nyou know as soon as she sees you, and is altogether very pretty. She is\r\nremarkably good-tempered when she has her own way, and very lively when\r\nshe is not out of humour. She is naturally extravagant and not very\r\naffected; she never reads anything but the letters she receives from me,\r\nand never writes anything but her answers to them. She plays, sings and\r\nDances, but has no taste for either, and excells in none, tho' she says\r\nshe is passionately fond of all. Perhaps you may flatter me so far as to\r\nbe surprised that one of whom I speak with so little affection should\r\nbe my particular freind; but to tell you the truth, our freindship arose\r\nrather from Caprice on her side than Esteem on mine. We spent two or\r\nthree days together with a Lady in Berkshire with whom we both happened\r\nto be connected--. During our visit, the Weather being remarkably bad,\r\nand our party particularly stupid, she was so good as to conceive\r\na violent partiality for me, which very soon settled in a downright\r\nFreindship and ended in an established correspondence. She is probably\r\nby this time as tired of me, as I am of her; but as she is too Polite\r\nand I am too civil to say so, our letters are still as frequent and\r\naffectionate as ever, and our Attachment as firm and sincere as when it\r\nfirst commenced. As she had a great taste for the pleasures of London,\r\nand of Brighthelmstone, she will I dare say find some difficulty in\r\nprevailing on herself even to satisfy the curiosity I dare say she feels\r\nof beholding you, at the expence of quitting those favourite haunts of\r\nDissipation, for the melancholy tho' venerable gloom of the castle you\r\ninhabit. Perhaps however if she finds her health impaired by too much\r\namusement, she may acquire fortitude sufficient to undertake a Journey\r\nto Scotland in the hope of its Proving at least beneficial to her\r\nhealth, if not conducive to her happiness. Your fears I am sorry to say,\r\nconcerning your father's extravagance, your own fortunes, your Mothers\r\nJewels and your Sister's consequence, I should suppose are but too well\r\nfounded. My freind herself has four thousand pounds, and will probably\r\nspend nearly as much every year in Dress and Public places, if she can\r\nget it--she will certainly not endeavour to reclaim Sir George from the\r\nmanner of living to which he has been so long accustomed, and there is\r\ntherefore some reason to fear that you will be very well off, if you get\r\nany fortune at all. The Jewels I should imagine too will undoubtedly be\r\nhers, and there is too much reason to think that she will preside at\r\nher Husbands table in preference to his Daughter. But as so melancholy a\r\nsubject must necessarily extremely distress you, I will no longer dwell\r\non it--.\r\n\r\nEloisa's indisposition has brought us to Bristol at so unfashionable a\r\nseason of the year, that we have actually seen but one genteel family\r\nsince we came. Mr and Mrs Marlowe are very agreable people; the ill\r\nhealth of their little boy occasioned their arrival here; you may\r\nimagine that being the only family with whom we can converse, we are\r\nof course on a footing of intimacy with them; we see them indeed almost\r\nevery day, and dined with them yesterday. We spent a very pleasant\r\nDay, and had a very good Dinner, tho' to be sure the Veal was terribly\r\nunderdone, and the Curry had no seasoning. I could not help wishing\r\nall dinner-time that I had been at the dressing it--. A brother of Mrs\r\nMarlowe, Mr Cleveland is with them at present; he is a good-looking\r\nyoung Man, and seems to have a good deal to say for himself. I tell\r\nEloisa that she should set her cap at him, but she does not at all\r\nseem to relish the proposal. I should like to see the girl married and\r\nCleveland has a very good estate. Perhaps you may wonder that I do not\r\nconsider myself as well as my Sister in my matrimonial Projects; but\r\nto tell you the truth I never wish to act a more principal part at a\r\nWedding than the superintending and directing the Dinner, and therefore\r\nwhile I can get any of my acquaintance to marry for me, I shall never\r\nthink of doing it myself, as I very much suspect that I should not have\r\nso much time for dressing my own Wedding-dinner, as for dressing that of\r\nmy freinds. Yours sincerely C. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the FIFTH Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL\r\nLesley-Castle March 18th\r\n\r\nOn the same day that I received your last kind letter, Matilda received\r\none from Sir George which was dated from Edinburgh, and informed us that\r\nhe should do himself the pleasure of introducing Lady Lesley to us on\r\nthe following evening. This as you may suppose considerably surprised\r\nus, particularly as your account of her Ladyship had given us reason to\r\nimagine there was little chance of her visiting Scotland at a time that\r\nLondon must be so gay. As it was our business however to be delighted at\r\nsuch a mark of condescension as a visit from Sir George and Lady Lesley,\r\nwe prepared to return them an answer expressive of the happiness we\r\nenjoyed in expectation of such a Blessing, when luckily recollecting\r\nthat as they were to reach the Castle the next Evening, it would be\r\nimpossible for my father to receive it before he left Edinburgh, we\r\ncontented ourselves with leaving them to suppose that we were as happy\r\nas we ought to be. At nine in the Evening on the following day,\r\nthey came, accompanied by one of Lady Lesleys brothers. Her Ladyship\r\nperfectly answers the description you sent me of her, except that I do\r\nnot think her so pretty as you seem to consider her. She has not a\r\nbad face, but there is something so extremely unmajestic in her little\r\ndiminutive figure, as to render her in comparison with the elegant\r\nheight of Matilda and Myself, an insignificant Dwarf. Her curiosity to\r\nsee us (which must have been great to bring her more than four hundred\r\nmiles) being now perfectly gratified, she already begins to mention\r\ntheir return to town, and has desired us to accompany her. We cannot\r\nrefuse her request since it is seconded by the commands of our Father,\r\nand thirded by the entreaties of Mr. Fitzgerald who is certainly one\r\nof the most pleasing young Men, I ever beheld. It is not yet determined\r\nwhen we are to go, but when ever we do we shall certainly take our\r\nlittle Louisa with us. Adeiu my dear Charlotte; Matilda unites in best\r\nwishes to you, and Eloisa, with yours ever M. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the SIXTH LADY LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL Lesley-Castle\r\nMarch 20th\r\n\r\nWe arrived here my sweet Freind about a fortnight ago, and I already\r\nheartily repent that I ever left our charming House in Portman-square\r\nfor such a dismal old weather-beaten Castle as this. You can form no\r\nidea sufficiently hideous, of its dungeon-like form. It is actually\r\nperched upon a Rock to appearance so totally inaccessible, that I\r\nexpected to have been pulled up by a rope; and sincerely repented having\r\ngratified my curiosity to behold my Daughters at the expence of being\r\nobliged to enter their prison in so dangerous and ridiculous a manner.\r\nBut as soon as I once found myself safely arrived in the inside of\r\nthis tremendous building, I comforted myself with the hope of having my\r\nspirits revived, by the sight of two beautifull girls, such as the Miss\r\nLesleys had been represented to me, at Edinburgh. But here again, I\r\nmet with nothing but Disappointment and Surprise. Matilda and Margaret\r\nLesley are two great, tall, out of the way, over-grown, girls, just of\r\na proper size to inhabit a Castle almost as large in comparison as\r\nthemselves. I wish my dear Charlotte that you could but behold these\r\nScotch giants; I am sure they would frighten you out of your wits.\r\nThey will do very well as foils to myself, so I have invited them to\r\naccompany me to London where I hope to be in the course of a fortnight.\r\nBesides these two fair Damsels, I found a little humoured Brat here who\r\nI beleive is some relation to them, they told me who she was, and gave\r\nme a long rigmerole story of her father and a Miss SOMEBODY which I have\r\nentirely forgot. I hate scandal and detest Children. I have been plagued\r\never since I came here with tiresome visits from a parcel of Scotch\r\nwretches, with terrible hard-names; they were so civil, gave me so many\r\ninvitations, and talked of coming again so soon, that I could not help\r\naffronting them. I suppose I shall not see them any more, and yet as\r\na family party we are so stupid, that I do not know what to do with\r\nmyself. These girls have no Music, but Scotch airs, no Drawings but\r\nScotch Mountains, and no Books but Scotch Poems--and I hate everything\r\nScotch. In general I can spend half the Day at my toilett with a great\r\ndeal of pleasure, but why should I dress here, since there is not a\r\ncreature in the House whom I have any wish to please. I have just had\r\na conversation with my Brother in which he has greatly offended me, and\r\nwhich as I have nothing more entertaining to send you I will gave you\r\nthe particulars of. You must know that I have for these 4 or 5 Days past\r\nstrongly suspected William of entertaining a partiality to my eldest\r\nDaughter. I own indeed that had I been inclined to fall in love with any\r\nwoman, I should not have made choice of Matilda Lesley for the object\r\nof my passion; for there is nothing I hate so much as a tall Woman: but\r\nhowever there is no accounting for some men's taste and as William is\r\nhimself nearly six feet high, it is not wonderful that he should be\r\npartial to that height. Now as I have a very great affection for my\r\nBrother and should be extremely sorry to see him unhappy, which I\r\nsuppose he means to be if he cannot marry Matilda, as moreover I know\r\nthat his circumstances will not allow him to marry any one without a\r\nfortune, and that Matilda's is entirely dependant on her Father, who\r\nwill neither have his own inclination nor my permission to give her\r\nanything at present, I thought it would be doing a good-natured action\r\nby my Brother to let him know as much, in order that he might choose\r\nfor himself, whether to conquer his passion, or Love and Despair.\r\nAccordingly finding myself this Morning alone with him in one of the\r\nhorrid old rooms of this Castle, I opened the cause to him in the\r\nfollowing Manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell my dear William what do you think of these girls? for my part, I\r\ndo not find them so plain as I expected: but perhaps you may think me\r\npartial to the Daughters of my Husband and perhaps you are right--They\r\nare indeed so very like Sir George that it is natural to think\u201d--\r\n\r\n\u201cMy Dear Susan (cried he in a tone of the greatest amazement) You do not\r\nreally think they bear the least resemblance to their Father! He is so\r\nvery plain!--but I beg your pardon--I had entirely forgotten to whom I\r\nwas speaking--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! pray dont mind me; (replied I) every one knows Sir George is\r\nhorribly ugly, and I assure you I always thought him a fright.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou surprise me extremely (answered William) by what you say both with\r\nrespect to Sir George and his Daughters. You cannot think your Husband\r\nso deficient in personal Charms as you speak of, nor can you surely see\r\nany resemblance between him and the Miss Lesleys who are in my opinion\r\nperfectly unlike him and perfectly Handsome.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf that is your opinion with regard to the girls it certainly is no\r\nproof of their Fathers beauty, for if they are perfectly unlike him and\r\nvery handsome at the same time, it is natural to suppose that he is very\r\nplain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy no means, (said he) for what may be pretty in a Woman, may be very\r\nunpleasing in a Man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you yourself (replied I) but a few minutes ago allowed him to be\r\nvery plain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMen are no Judges of Beauty in their own Sex.\u201d (said he).\r\n\r\n\u201cNeither Men nor Women can think Sir George tolerable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well, (said he) we will not dispute about HIS Beauty, but your\r\nopinion of his DAUGHTERS is surely very singular, for if I understood\r\nyou right, you said you did not find them so plain as you expected to\r\ndo!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, do YOU find them plainer then?\u201d (said I).\r\n\r\n\u201cI can scarcely beleive you to be serious (returned he) when you speak\r\nof their persons in so extroidinary a Manner. Do not you think the Miss\r\nLesleys are two very handsome young Women?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLord! No! (cried I) I think them terribly plain!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPlain! (replied He) My dear Susan, you cannot really think so! Why\r\nwhat single Feature in the face of either of them, can you possibly find\r\nfault with?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! trust me for that; (replied I). Come I will begin with the\r\neldest--with Matilda. Shall I, William?\u201d (I looked as cunning as I could\r\nwhen I said it, in order to shame him).\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are so much alike (said he) that I should suppose the faults of\r\none, would be the faults of both.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, in the first place; they are both so horribly tall!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are TALLER than you are indeed.\u201d (said he with a saucy smile.)\r\n\r\n\u201cNay, (said I), I know nothing of that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, but (he continued) tho' they may be above the common size, their\r\nfigures are perfectly elegant; and as to their faces, their Eyes are\r\nbeautifull.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never can think such tremendous, knock-me-down figures in the least\r\ndegree elegant, and as for their eyes, they are so tall that I never\r\ncould strain my neck enough to look at them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay, (replied he) I know not whether you may not be in the right in not\r\nattempting it, for perhaps they might dazzle you with their Lustre.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! Certainly. (said I, with the greatest complacency, for I assure\r\nyou my dearest Charlotte I was not in the least offended tho' by what\r\nfollowed, one would suppose that William was conscious of having given\r\nme just cause to be so, for coming up to me and taking my hand, he said)\r\n\u201cYou must not look so grave Susan; you will make me fear I have offended\r\nyou!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOffended me! Dear Brother, how came such a thought in your head!\r\n(returned I) No really! I assure you that I am not in the least\r\nsurprised at your being so warm an advocate for the Beauty of these\r\ngirls.\u201d--\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, but (interrupted William) remember that we have not yet\r\nconcluded our dispute concerning them. What fault do you find with their\r\ncomplexion?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are so horridly pale.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have always a little colour, and after any exercise it is\r\nconsiderably heightened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but if there should ever happen to be any rain in this part of\r\nthe world, they will never be able raise more than their common\r\nstock--except indeed they amuse themselves with running up and Down\r\nthese horrid old galleries and Antichambers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, (replied my Brother in a tone of vexation, and glancing an\r\nimpertinent look at me) if they HAVE but little colour, at least, it is\r\nall their own.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was too much my dear Charlotte, for I am certain that he had the\r\nimpudence by that look, of pretending to suspect the reality of mine.\r\nBut you I am sure will vindicate my character whenever you may hear\r\nit so cruelly aspersed, for you can witness how often I have protested\r\nagainst wearing Rouge, and how much I always told you I disliked it. And\r\nI assure you that my opinions are still the same.--. Well, not bearing\r\nto be so suspected by my Brother, I left the room immediately, and have\r\nbeen ever since in my own Dressing-room writing to you. What a long\r\nletter have I made of it! But you must not expect to receive such from\r\nme when I get to Town; for it is only at Lesley castle, that one has\r\ntime to write even to a Charlotte Lutterell.--. I was so much vexed by\r\nWilliam's glance, that I could not summon Patience enough, to stay and\r\ngive him that advice respecting his attachment to Matilda which had\r\nfirst induced me from pure Love to him to begin the conversation; and\r\nI am now so thoroughly convinced by it, of his violent passion for her,\r\nthat I am certain he would never hear reason on the subject, and I\r\nshall there fore give myself no more trouble either about him or his\r\nfavourite. Adeiu my dear girl--Yrs affectionately Susan L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the SEVENTH From Miss C. LUTTERELL to Miss M. LESLEY Bristol the\r\n27th of March\r\n\r\nI have received Letters from you and your Mother-in-law within this week\r\nwhich have greatly entertained me, as I find by them that you are both\r\ndownright jealous of each others Beauty. It is very odd that two pretty\r\nWomen tho' actually Mother and Daughter cannot be in the same House\r\nwithout falling out about their faces. Do be convinced that you are both\r\nperfectly handsome and say no more of the Matter. I suppose this letter\r\nmust be directed to Portman Square where probably (great as is your\r\naffection for Lesley Castle) you will not be sorry to find yourself. In\r\nspite of all that people may say about Green fields and the Country\r\nI was always of opinion that London and its amusements must be very\r\nagreable for a while, and should be very happy could my Mother's income\r\nallow her to jockey us into its Public-places, during Winter. I always\r\nlonged particularly to go to Vaux-hall, to see whether the cold Beef\r\nthere is cut so thin as it is reported, for I have a sly suspicion that\r\nfew people understand the art of cutting a slice of cold Beef so well\r\nas I do: nay it would be hard if I did not know something of the Matter,\r\nfor it was a part of my Education that I took by far the most pains\r\nwith. Mama always found me HER best scholar, tho' when Papa was\r\nalive Eloisa was HIS. Never to be sure were there two more different\r\nDispositions in the World. We both loved Reading. SHE preferred\r\nHistories, and I Receipts. She loved drawing, Pictures, and I drawing\r\nPullets. No one could sing a better song than she, and no one make a\r\nbetter Pye than I.--And so it has always continued since we have been\r\nno longer children. The only difference is that all disputes on the\r\nsuperior excellence of our Employments THEN so frequent are now no more.\r\nWe have for many years entered into an agreement always to admire\r\neach other's works; I never fail listening to HER Music, and she is as\r\nconstant in eating my pies. Such at least was the case till Henry Hervey\r\nmade his appearance in Sussex. Before the arrival of his Aunt in our\r\nneighbourhood where she established herself you know about a twelvemonth\r\nago, his visits to her had been at stated times, and of equal and\r\nsettled Duration; but on her removal to the Hall which is within a walk\r\nfrom our House, they became both more frequent and longer. This as you\r\nmay suppose could not be pleasing to Mrs Diana who is a professed enemy\r\nto everything which is not directed by Decorum and Formality, or which\r\nbears the least resemblance to Ease and Good-breeding. Nay so great was\r\nher aversion to her Nephews behaviour that I have often heard her give\r\nsuch hints of it before his face that had not Henry at such times been\r\nengaged in conversation with Eloisa, they must have caught his Attention\r\nand have very much distressed him. The alteration in my Sisters\r\nbehaviour which I have before hinted at, now took place. The Agreement\r\nwe had entered into of admiring each others productions she no\r\nlonger seemed to regard, and tho' I constantly applauded even every\r\nCountry-dance, she played, yet not even a pidgeon-pye of my making could\r\nobtain from her a single word of approbation. This was certainly enough\r\nto put any one in a Passion; however, I was as cool as a cream-cheese\r\nand having formed my plan and concerted a scheme of Revenge, I was\r\ndetermined to let her have her own way and not even to make her a single\r\nreproach. My scheme was to treat her as she treated me, and tho' she\r\nmight even draw my own Picture or play Malbrook (which is the only tune\r\nI ever really liked) not to say so much as \u201cThank you Eloisa;\u201d tho'\r\nI had for many years constantly hollowed whenever she played, BRAVO,\r\nBRAVISSIMO, ENCORE, DA CAPO, ALLEGRETTO, CON EXPRESSIONE, and POCO\r\nPRESTO with many other such outlandish words, all of them as Eloisa told\r\nme expressive of my Admiration; and so indeed I suppose they are, as I\r\nsee some of them in every Page of every Music book, being the sentiments\r\nI imagine of the composer.\r\n\r\nI executed my Plan with great Punctuality. I can not say success, for\r\nalas! my silence while she played seemed not in the least to displease\r\nher; on the contrary she actually said to me one day \u201cWell Charlotte,\r\nI am very glad to find that you have at last left off that ridiculous\r\ncustom of applauding my Execution on the Harpsichord till you made\r\nmy head ake, and yourself hoarse. I feel very much obliged to you for\r\nkeeping your admiration to yourself.\u201d I never shall forget the very\r\nwitty answer I made to this speech. \u201cEloisa (said I) I beg you would\r\nbe quite at your Ease with respect to all such fears in future, for\r\nbe assured that I shall always keep my admiration to myself and my own\r\npursuits and never extend it to yours.\u201d This was the only very severe\r\nthing I ever said in my Life; not but that I have often felt myself\r\nextremely satirical but it was the only time I ever made my feelings\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nI suppose there never were two Young people who had a greater affection\r\nfor each other than Henry and Eloisa; no, the Love of your Brother for\r\nMiss Burton could not be so strong tho' it might be more violent. You\r\nmay imagine therefore how provoked my Sister must have been to have\r\nhim play her such a trick. Poor girl! she still laments his Death with\r\nundiminished constancy, notwithstanding he has been dead more than six\r\nweeks; but some People mind such things more than others. The ill state\r\nof Health into which his loss has thrown her makes her so weak, and so\r\nunable to support the least exertion, that she has been in tears all\r\nthis Morning merely from having taken leave of Mrs. Marlowe who with her\r\nHusband, Brother and Child are to leave Bristol this morning. I am sorry\r\nto have them go because they are the only family with whom we have here\r\nany acquaintance, but I never thought of crying; to be sure Eloisa\r\nand Mrs Marlowe have always been more together than with me, and have\r\ntherefore contracted a kind of affection for each other, which does not\r\nmake Tears so inexcusable in them as they would be in me. The Marlowes\r\nare going to Town; Cliveland accompanies them; as neither Eloisa nor I\r\ncould catch him I hope you or Matilda may have better Luck. I know not\r\nwhen we shall leave Bristol, Eloisa's spirits are so low that she is\r\nvery averse to moving, and yet is certainly by no means mended by her\r\nresidence here. A week or two will I hope determine our Measures--in the\r\nmean time believe me and etc--and etc--Charlotte Lutterell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the EIGHTH Miss LUTTERELL to Mrs MARLOWE Bristol April 4th\r\n\r\nI feel myself greatly obliged to you my dear Emma for such a mark of\r\nyour affection as I flatter myself was conveyed in the proposal you made\r\nme of our Corresponding; I assure you that it will be a great releif to\r\nme to write to you and as long as my Health and Spirits will allow\r\nme, you will find me a very constant correspondent; I will not say\r\nan entertaining one, for you know my situation suffciently not to be\r\nignorant that in me Mirth would be improper and I know my own Heart too\r\nwell not to be sensible that it would be unnatural. You must not expect\r\nnews for we see no one with whom we are in the least acquainted, or in\r\nwhose proceedings we have any Interest. You must not expect scandal\r\nfor by the same rule we are equally debarred either from hearing or\r\ninventing it.--You must expect from me nothing but the melancholy\r\neffusions of a broken Heart which is ever reverting to the Happiness\r\nit once enjoyed and which ill supports its present wretchedness. The\r\nPossibility of being able to write, to speak, to you of my lost Henry\r\nwill be a luxury to me, and your goodness will not I know refuse to read\r\nwhat it will so much releive my Heart to write. I once thought that to\r\nhave what is in general called a Freind (I mean one of my own sex\r\nto whom I might speak with less reserve than to any other person)\r\nindependant of my sister would never be an object of my wishes, but how\r\nmuch was I mistaken! Charlotte is too much engrossed by two confidential\r\ncorrespondents of that sort, to supply the place of one to me, and I\r\nhope you will not think me girlishly romantic, when I say that to\r\nhave some kind and compassionate Freind who might listen to my sorrows\r\nwithout endeavouring to console me was what I had for some time wished\r\nfor, when our acquaintance with you, the intimacy which followed it and\r\nthe particular affectionate attention you paid me almost from the first,\r\ncaused me to entertain the flattering Idea of those attentions being\r\nimproved on a closer acquaintance into a Freindship which, if you were\r\nwhat my wishes formed you would be the greatest Happiness I could\r\nbe capable of enjoying. To find that such Hopes are realised is a\r\nsatisfaction indeed, a satisfaction which is now almost the only one I\r\ncan ever experience.--I feel myself so languid that I am sure were you\r\nwith me you would oblige me to leave off writing, and I cannot give you\r\na greater proof of my affection for you than by acting, as I know you\r\nwould wish me to do, whether Absent or Present. I am my dear Emmas\r\nsincere freind E. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the NINTH Mrs MARLOWE to Miss LUTTERELL Grosvenor Street, April\r\n10th\r\n\r\nNeed I say my dear Eloisa how wellcome your letter was to me I cannot\r\ngive a greater proof of the pleasure I received from it, or of the\r\nDesire I feel that our Correspondence may be regular and frequent than\r\nby setting you so good an example as I now do in answering it before the\r\nend of the week--. But do not imagine that I claim any merit in being\r\nso punctual; on the contrary I assure you, that it is a far greater\r\nGratification to me to write to you, than to spend the Evening either at\r\na Concert or a Ball. Mr Marlowe is so desirous of my appearing at some\r\nof the Public places every evening that I do not like to refuse him, but\r\nat the same time so much wish to remain at Home, that independant of\r\nthe Pleasure I experience in devoting any portion of my Time to my\r\nDear Eloisa, yet the Liberty I claim from having a letter to write of\r\nspending an Evening at home with my little Boy, you know me well enough\r\nto be sensible, will of itself be a sufficient Inducement (if one is\r\nnecessary) to my maintaining with Pleasure a Correspondence with you.\r\nAs to the subject of your letters to me, whether grave or merry, if they\r\nconcern you they must be equally interesting to me; not but that I think\r\nthe melancholy Indulgence of your own sorrows by repeating them and\r\ndwelling on them to me, will only encourage and increase them, and\r\nthat it will be more prudent in you to avoid so sad a subject; but yet\r\nknowing as I do what a soothing and melancholy Pleasure it must afford\r\nyou, I cannot prevail on myself to deny you so great an Indulgence, and\r\nwill only insist on your not expecting me to encourage you in it, by my\r\nown letters; on the contrary I intend to fill them with such lively Wit\r\nand enlivening Humour as shall even provoke a smile in the sweet but\r\nsorrowfull countenance of my Eloisa.\r\n\r\nIn the first place you are to learn that I have met your sisters three\r\nfreinds Lady Lesley and her Daughters, twice in Public since I have been\r\nhere. I know you will be impatient to hear my opinion of the Beauty of\r\nthree Ladies of whom you have heard so much. Now, as you are too ill and\r\ntoo unhappy to be vain, I think I may venture to inform you that I\r\nlike none of their faces so well as I do your own. Yet they are all\r\nhandsome--Lady Lesley indeed I have seen before; her Daughters I beleive\r\nwould in general be said to have a finer face than her Ladyship, and yet\r\nwhat with the charms of a Blooming complexion, a little Affectation and\r\na great deal of small-talk, (in each of which she is superior to the\r\nyoung Ladies) she will I dare say gain herself as many admirers as the\r\nmore regular features of Matilda, and Margaret. I am sure you will agree\r\nwith me in saying that they can none of them be of a proper size for\r\nreal Beauty, when you know that two of them are taller and the other\r\nshorter than ourselves. In spite of this Defect (or rather by reason\r\nof it) there is something very noble and majestic in the figures of the\r\nMiss Lesleys, and something agreably lively in the appearance of their\r\npretty little Mother-in-law. But tho' one may be majestic and the other\r\nlively, yet the faces of neither possess that Bewitching sweetness of\r\nmy Eloisas, which her present languor is so far from diminushing. What\r\nwould my Husband and Brother say of us, if they knew all the fine things\r\nI have been saying to you in this letter. It is very hard that a pretty\r\nwoman is never to be told she is so by any one of her own sex without\r\nthat person's being suspected to be either her determined Enemy, or\r\nher professed Toad-eater. How much more amiable are women in that\r\nparticular! One man may say forty civil things to another without our\r\nsupposing that he is ever paid for it, and provided he does his Duty by\r\nour sex, we care not how Polite he is to his own.\r\n\r\nMrs Lutterell will be so good as to accept my compliments, Charlotte,\r\nmy Love, and Eloisa the best wishes for the recovery of her Health and\r\nSpirits that can be offered by her affectionate Freind E. Marlowe.\r\n\r\nI am afraid this letter will be but a poor specimen of my Powers in the\r\nwitty way; and your opinion of them will not be greatly increased when I\r\nassure you that I have been as entertaining as I possibly could.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the TENTH From Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL\r\nPortman Square April 13th\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CHARLOTTE We left Lesley-Castle on the 28th of last Month,\r\nand arrived safely in London after a Journey of seven Days; I had the\r\npleasure of finding your Letter here waiting my Arrival, for which you\r\nhave my grateful Thanks. Ah! my dear Freind I every day more regret the\r\nserene and tranquil Pleasures of the Castle we have left, in exchange\r\nfor the uncertain and unequal Amusements of this vaunted City. Not that\r\nI will pretend to assert that these uncertain and unequal Amusements\r\nare in the least Degree unpleasing to me; on the contrary I enjoy them\r\nextremely and should enjoy them even more, were I not certain that every\r\nappearance I make in Public but rivetts the Chains of those unhappy\r\nBeings whose Passion it is impossible not to pity, tho' it is out of my\r\npower to return. In short my Dear Charlotte it is my sensibility for\r\nthe sufferings of so many amiable young Men, my Dislike of the extreme\r\nadmiration I meet with, and my aversion to being so celebrated both in\r\nPublic, in Private, in Papers, and in Printshops, that are the reasons\r\nwhy I cannot more fully enjoy, the Amusements so various and pleasing\r\nof London. How often have I wished that I possessed as little Personal\r\nBeauty as you do; that my figure were as inelegant; my face as unlovely;\r\nand my appearance as unpleasing as yours! But ah! what little chance\r\nis there of so desirable an Event; I have had the small-pox, and must\r\ntherefore submit to my unhappy fate.\r\n\r\nI am now going to intrust you my dear Charlotte with a secret which has\r\nlong disturbed the tranquility of my days, and which is of a kind to\r\nrequire the most inviolable Secrecy from you. Last Monday se'night\r\nMatilda and I accompanied Lady Lesley to a Rout at the Honourable Mrs\r\nKickabout's; we were escorted by Mr Fitzgerald who is a very amiable\r\nyoung Man in the main, tho' perhaps a little singular in his Taste--He\r\nis in love with Matilda--. We had scarcely paid our Compliments to the\r\nLady of the House and curtseyed to half a score different people when my\r\nAttention was attracted by the appearance of a Young Man the most lovely\r\nof his Sex, who at that moment entered the Room with another Gentleman\r\nand Lady. From the first moment I beheld him, I was certain that on him\r\ndepended the future Happiness of my Life. Imagine my surprise when he\r\nwas introduced to me by the name of Cleveland--I instantly recognised\r\nhim as the Brother of Mrs Marlowe, and the acquaintance of my Charlotte\r\nat Bristol. Mr and Mrs M. were the gentleman and Lady who accompanied\r\nhim. (You do not think Mrs Marlowe handsome?) The elegant address of Mr\r\nCleveland, his polished Manners and Delightful Bow, at once confirmed my\r\nattachment. He did not speak; but I can imagine everything he would have\r\nsaid, had he opened his Mouth. I can picture to myself the cultivated\r\nUnderstanding, the Noble sentiments, and elegant Language which would\r\nhave shone so conspicuous in the conversation of Mr Cleveland. The\r\napproach of Sir James Gower (one of my too numerous admirers) prevented\r\nthe Discovery of any such Powers, by putting an end to a Conversation we\r\nhad never commenced, and by attracting my attention to himself. But oh!\r\nhow inferior are the accomplishments of Sir James to those of his so\r\ngreatly envied Rival! Sir James is one of the most frequent of our\r\nVisitors, and is almost always of our Parties. We have since often met\r\nMr and Mrs Marlowe but no Cleveland--he is always engaged some where\r\nelse. Mrs Marlowe fatigues me to Death every time I see her by her\r\ntiresome Conversations about you and Eloisa. She is so stupid! I live in\r\nthe hope of seeing her irrisistable Brother to night, as we are going to\r\nLady Flambeaus, who is I know intimate with the Marlowes. Our party will\r\nbe Lady Lesley, Matilda, Fitzgerald, Sir James Gower, and myself. We see\r\nlittle of Sir George, who is almost always at the gaming-table. Ah! my\r\npoor Fortune where art thou by this time? We see more of Lady L. who\r\nalways makes her appearance (highly rouged) at Dinner-time. Alas! what\r\nDelightful Jewels will she be decked in this evening at Lady Flambeau's!\r\nYet I wonder how she can herself delight in wearing them; surely she\r\nmust be sensible of the ridiculous impropriety of loading her little\r\ndiminutive figure with such superfluous ornaments; is it possible that\r\nshe can not know how greatly superior an elegant simplicity is to the\r\nmost studied apparel? Would she but Present them to Matilda and me, how\r\ngreatly should we be obliged to her, How becoming would Diamonds be on\r\nour fine majestic figures! And how surprising it is that such an Idea\r\nshould never have occurred to HER. I am sure if I have reflected in this\r\nmanner once, I have fifty times. Whenever I see Lady Lesley dressed in\r\nthem such reflections immediately come across me. My own Mother's Jewels\r\ntoo! But I will say no more on so melancholy a subject--let me entertain\r\nyou with something more pleasing--Matilda had a letter this morning from\r\nLesley, by which we have the pleasure of finding that he is at Naples\r\nhas turned Roman-Catholic, obtained one of the Pope's Bulls for\r\nannulling his 1st Marriage and has since actually married a Neapolitan\r\nLady of great Rank and Fortune. He tells us moreover that much the same\r\nsort of affair has befallen his first wife the worthless Louisa who is\r\nlikewise at Naples had turned Roman-catholic, and is soon to be married\r\nto a Neapolitan Nobleman of great and Distinguished merit. He says,\r\nthat they are at present very good Freinds, have quite forgiven all\r\npast errors and intend in future to be very good Neighbours. He invites\r\nMatilda and me to pay him a visit to Italy and to bring him his little\r\nLouisa whom both her Mother, Step-mother, and himself are equally\r\ndesirous of beholding. As to our accepting his invitation, it is at\r\nPresent very uncertain; Lady Lesley advises us to go without loss of\r\ntime; Fitzgerald offers to escort us there, but Matilda has some doubts\r\nof the Propriety of such a scheme--she owns it would be very agreable.\r\nI am certain she likes the Fellow. My Father desires us not to be in a\r\nhurry, as perhaps if we wait a few months both he and Lady Lesley will\r\ndo themselves the pleasure of attending us. Lady Lesley says no, that\r\nnothing will ever tempt her to forego the Amusements of Brighthelmstone\r\nfor a Journey to Italy merely to see our Brother. \u201cNo (says the\r\ndisagreable Woman) I have once in my life been fool enough to travel I\r\ndont know how many hundred Miles to see two of the Family, and I found\r\nit did not answer, so Deuce take me, if ever I am so foolish again.\u201d So\r\nsays her Ladyship, but Sir George still Perseveres in saying that\r\nperhaps in a month or two, they may accompany us. Adeiu my Dear\r\nCharlotte Yrs faithful Margaret Lesley.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF ENGLAND\r\n\r\nFROM THE REIGN OF HENRY THE 4TH TO THE DEATH OF CHARLES THE 1ST\r\n\r\nBY A PARTIAL, PREJUDICED, AND IGNORANT HISTORIAN.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nTo Miss Austen, eldest daughter of the Rev. George Austen, this work is\r\ninscribed with all due respect by THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nN.B. There will be very few Dates in this History.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY the 4th\r\n\r\nHenry the 4th ascended the throne of England much to his own\r\nsatisfaction in the year 1399, after having prevailed on his cousin and\r\npredecessor Richard the 2nd, to resign it to him, and to retire for the\r\nrest of his life to Pomfret Castle, where he happened to be murdered.\r\nIt is to be supposed that Henry was married, since he had certainly four\r\nsons, but it is not in my power to inform the Reader who was his wife.\r\nBe this as it may, he did not live for ever, but falling ill, his son\r\nthe Prince of Wales came and took away the crown; whereupon the King\r\nmade a long speech, for which I must refer the Reader to Shakespear's\r\nPlays, and the Prince made a still longer. Things being thus settled\r\nbetween them the King died, and was succeeded by his son Henry who had\r\npreviously beat Sir William Gascoigne.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY the 5th\r\n\r\nThis Prince after he succeeded to the throne grew quite reformed and\r\namiable, forsaking all his dissipated companions, and never thrashing\r\nSir William again. During his reign, Lord Cobham was burnt alive, but I\r\nforget what for. His Majesty then turned his thoughts to France, where\r\nhe went and fought the famous Battle of Agincourt. He afterwards married\r\nthe King's daughter Catherine, a very agreable woman by Shakespear's\r\naccount. In spite of all this however he died, and was succeeded by his\r\nson Henry.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY the 6th\r\n\r\nI cannot say much for this Monarch's sense. Nor would I if I could, for\r\nhe was a Lancastrian. I suppose you know all about the Wars between him\r\nand the Duke of York who was of the right side; if you do not, you had\r\nbetter read some other History, for I shall not be very diffuse in this,\r\nmeaning by it only to vent my spleen AGAINST, and shew my Hatred TO all\r\nthose people whose parties or principles do not suit with mine, and not\r\nto give information. This King married Margaret of Anjou, a Woman whose\r\ndistresses and misfortunes were so great as almost to make me who hate\r\nher, pity her. It was in this reign that Joan of Arc lived and made such\r\na ROW among the English. They should not have burnt her--but they did.\r\nThere were several Battles between the Yorkists and Lancastrians, in\r\nwhich the former (as they ought) usually conquered. At length they were\r\nentirely overcome; The King was murdered--The Queen was sent home--and\r\nEdward the 4th ascended the Throne.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD the 4th\r\n\r\nThis Monarch was famous only for his Beauty and his Courage, of which\r\nthe Picture we have here given of him, and his undaunted Behaviour\r\nin marrying one Woman while he was engaged to another, are sufficient\r\nproofs. His Wife was Elizabeth Woodville, a Widow who, poor Woman! was\r\nafterwards confined in a Convent by that Monster of Iniquity and Avarice\r\nHenry the 7th. One of Edward's Mistresses was Jane Shore, who has had\r\na play written about her, but it is a tragedy and therefore not worth\r\nreading. Having performed all these noble actions, his Majesty died, and\r\nwas succeeded by his son.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD the 5th\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate Prince lived so little a while that nobody had him to\r\ndraw his picture. He was murdered by his Uncle's Contrivance, whose name\r\nwas Richard the 3rd.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD the 3rd\r\n\r\nThe Character of this Prince has been in general very severely treated\r\nby Historians, but as he was a YORK, I am rather inclined to suppose him\r\na very respectable Man. It has indeed been confidently asserted that he\r\nkilled his two Nephews and his Wife, but it has also been declared that\r\nhe did not kill his two Nephews, which I am inclined to beleive true;\r\nand if this is the case, it may also be affirmed that he did not kill\r\nhis Wife, for if Perkin Warbeck was really the Duke of York, why might\r\nnot Lambert Simnel be the Widow of Richard. Whether innocent or guilty,\r\nhe did not reign long in peace, for Henry Tudor E. of Richmond as great\r\na villain as ever lived, made a great fuss about getting the Crown and\r\nhaving killed the King at the battle of Bosworth, he succeeded to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY the 7th\r\n\r\nThis Monarch soon after his accession married the Princess Elizabeth of\r\nYork, by which alliance he plainly proved that he thought his own right\r\ninferior to hers, tho' he pretended to the contrary. By this Marriage he\r\nhad two sons and two daughters, the elder of which Daughters was married\r\nto the King of Scotland and had the happiness of being grandmother\r\nto one of the first Characters in the World. But of HER, I shall have\r\noccasion to speak more at large in future. The youngest, Mary, married\r\nfirst the King of France and secondly the D. of Suffolk, by whom she had\r\none daughter, afterwards the Mother of Lady Jane Grey, who tho' inferior\r\nto her lovely Cousin the Queen of Scots, was yet an amiable young woman\r\nand famous for reading Greek while other people were hunting. It was in\r\nthe reign of Henry the 7th that Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Simnel before\r\nmentioned made their appearance, the former of whom was set in the\r\nstocks, took shelter in Beaulieu Abbey, and was beheaded with the Earl\r\nof Warwick, and the latter was taken into the Kings kitchen. His Majesty\r\ndied and was succeeded by his son Henry whose only merit was his not\r\nbeing quite so bad as his daughter Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY the 8th\r\n\r\nIt would be an affront to my Readers were I to suppose that they were\r\nnot as well acquainted with the particulars of this King's reign as I am\r\nmyself. It will therefore be saving THEM the task of reading again what\r\nthey have read before, and MYSELF the trouble of writing what I do not\r\nperfectly recollect, by giving only a slight sketch of the principal\r\nEvents which marked his reign. Among these may be ranked Cardinal\r\nWolsey's telling the father Abbott of Leicester Abbey that \u201che was come\r\nto lay his bones among them,\u201d the reformation in Religion and the King's\r\nriding through the streets of London with Anna Bullen. It is however\r\nbut Justice, and my Duty to declare that this amiable Woman was entirely\r\ninnocent of the Crimes with which she was accused, and of which her\r\nBeauty, her Elegance, and her Sprightliness were sufficient proofs, not\r\nto mention her solemn Protestations of Innocence, the weakness of the\r\nCharges against her, and the King's Character; all of which add some\r\nconfirmation, tho' perhaps but slight ones when in comparison with those\r\nbefore alledged in her favour. Tho' I do not profess giving many dates,\r\nyet as I think it proper to give some and shall of course make choice\r\nof those which it is most necessary for the Reader to know, I think it\r\nright to inform him that her letter to the King was dated on the 6th of\r\nMay. The Crimes and Cruelties of this Prince, were too numerous to be\r\nmentioned, (as this history I trust has fully shown;) and nothing can\r\nbe said in his vindication, but that his abolishing Religious Houses and\r\nleaving them to the ruinous depredations of time has been of infinite\r\nuse to the landscape of England in general, which probably was a\r\nprincipal motive for his doing it, since otherwise why should a Man who\r\nwas of no Religion himself be at so much trouble to abolish one which\r\nhad for ages been established in the Kingdom. His Majesty's 5th Wife\r\nwas the Duke of Norfolk's Neice who, tho' universally acquitted of the\r\ncrimes for which she was beheaded, has been by many people supposed to\r\nhave led an abandoned life before her Marriage--of this however I have\r\nmany doubts, since she was a relation of that noble Duke of Norfolk who\r\nwas so warm in the Queen of Scotland's cause, and who at last fell a\r\nvictim to it. The Kings last wife contrived to survive him, but with\r\ndifficulty effected it. He was succeeded by his only son Edward.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD the 6th\r\n\r\nAs this prince was only nine years old at the time of his Father's\r\ndeath, he was considered by many people as too young to govern, and the\r\nlate King happening to be of the same opinion, his mother's Brother the\r\nDuke of Somerset was chosen Protector of the realm during his minority.\r\nThis Man was on the whole of a very amiable Character, and is somewhat\r\nof a favourite with me, tho' I would by no means pretend to affirm that\r\nhe was equal to those first of Men Robert Earl of Essex, Delamere, or\r\nGilpin. He was beheaded, of which he might with reason have been proud,\r\nhad he known that such was the death of Mary Queen of Scotland; but\r\nas it was impossible that he should be conscious of what had never\r\nhappened, it does not appear that he felt particularly delighted with\r\nthe manner of it. After his decease the Duke of Northumberland had the\r\ncare of the King and the Kingdom, and performed his trust of both so\r\nwell that the King died and the Kingdom was left to his daughter in law\r\nthe Lady Jane Grey, who has been already mentioned as reading Greek.\r\nWhether she really understood that language or whether such a study\r\nproceeded only from an excess of vanity for which I beleive she was\r\nalways rather remarkable, is uncertain. Whatever might be the cause,\r\nshe preserved the same appearance of knowledge, and contempt of what\r\nwas generally esteemed pleasure, during the whole of her life, for\r\nshe declared herself displeased with being appointed Queen, and while\r\nconducting to the scaffold, she wrote a sentence in Latin and another in\r\nGreek on seeing the dead Body of her Husband accidentally passing that\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARY\r\n\r\nThis woman had the good luck of being advanced to the throne of England,\r\nin spite of the superior pretensions, Merit, and Beauty of her Cousins\r\nMary Queen of Scotland and Jane Grey. Nor can I pity the Kingdom for the\r\nmisfortunes they experienced during her Reign, since they fully deserved\r\nthem, for having allowed her to succeed her Brother--which was a double\r\npeice of folly, since they might have foreseen that as she died without\r\nchildren, she would be succeeded by that disgrace to humanity, that\r\npest of society, Elizabeth. Many were the people who fell martyrs to the\r\nprotestant Religion during her reign; I suppose not fewer than a dozen.\r\nShe married Philip King of Spain who in her sister's reign was famous\r\nfor building Armadas. She died without issue, and then the dreadful\r\nmoment came in which the destroyer of all comfort, the deceitful\r\nBetrayer of trust reposed in her, and the Murderess of her Cousin\r\nsucceeded to the Throne.----\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH\r\n\r\nIt was the peculiar misfortune of this Woman to have bad\r\nMinisters---Since wicked as she herself was, she could not have\r\ncommitted such extensive mischeif, had not these vile and abandoned Men\r\nconnived at, and encouraged her in her Crimes. I know that it has by\r\nmany people been asserted and beleived that Lord Burleigh, Sir Francis\r\nWalsingham, and the rest of those who filled the cheif offices of State\r\nwere deserving, experienced, and able Ministers. But oh! how blinded\r\nsuch writers and such Readers must be to true Merit, to Merit despised,\r\nneglected and defamed, if they can persist in such opinions when they\r\nreflect that these men, these boasted men were such scandals to their\r\nCountry and their sex as to allow and assist their Queen in confining\r\nfor the space of nineteen years, a WOMAN who if the claims of\r\nRelationship and Merit were of no avail, yet as a Queen and as one who\r\ncondescended to place confidence in her, had every reason to expect\r\nassistance and protection; and at length in allowing Elizabeth to bring\r\nthis amiable Woman to an untimely, unmerited, and scandalous Death. Can\r\nany one if he reflects but for a moment on this blot, this everlasting\r\nblot upon their understanding and their Character, allow any praise to\r\nLord Burleigh or Sir Francis Walsingham? Oh! what must this bewitching\r\nPrincess whose only freind was then the Duke of Norfolk, and whose\r\nonly ones now Mr Whitaker, Mrs Lefroy, Mrs Knight and myself, who was\r\nabandoned by her son, confined by her Cousin, abused, reproached and\r\nvilified by all, what must not her most noble mind have suffered when\r\ninformed that Elizabeth had given orders for her Death! Yet she bore\r\nit with a most unshaken fortitude, firm in her mind; constant in her\r\nReligion; and prepared herself to meet the cruel fate to which she\r\nwas doomed, with a magnanimity that would alone proceed from conscious\r\nInnocence. And yet could you Reader have beleived it possible that\r\nsome hardened and zealous Protestants have even abused her for that\r\nsteadfastness in the Catholic Religion which reflected on her so\r\nmuch credit? But this is a striking proof of THEIR narrow souls and\r\nprejudiced Judgements who accuse her. She was executed in the Great Hall\r\nat Fortheringay Castle (sacred Place!) on Wednesday the 8th of February\r\n1586--to the everlasting Reproach of Elizabeth, her Ministers, and of\r\nEngland in general. It may not be unnecessary before I entirely conclude\r\nmy account of this ill-fated Queen, to observe that she had been accused\r\nof several crimes during the time of her reigning in Scotland, of which\r\nI now most seriously do assure my Reader that she was entirely innocent;\r\nhaving never been guilty of anything more than Imprudencies into which\r\nshe was betrayed by the openness of her Heart, her Youth, and her\r\nEducation. Having I trust by this assurance entirely done away every\r\nSuspicion and every doubt which might have arisen in the Reader's mind,\r\nfrom what other Historians have written of her, I shall proceed to\r\nmention the remaining Events that marked Elizabeth's reign. It was about\r\nthis time that Sir Francis Drake the first English Navigator who sailed\r\nround the World, lived, to be the ornament of his Country and his\r\nprofession. Yet great as he was, and justly celebrated as a sailor,\r\nI cannot help foreseeing that he will be equalled in this or the next\r\nCentury by one who tho' now but young, already promises to answer all\r\nthe ardent and sanguine expectations of his Relations and Freinds,\r\namongst whom I may class the amiable Lady to whom this work is\r\ndedicated, and my no less amiable self.\r\n\r\nThough of a different profession, and shining in a different sphere of\r\nLife, yet equally conspicuous in the Character of an Earl, as Drake was\r\nin that of a Sailor, was Robert Devereux Lord Essex. This unfortunate\r\nyoung Man was not unlike in character to that equally unfortunate\r\none FREDERIC DELAMERE. The simile may be carried still farther, and\r\nElizabeth the torment of Essex may be compared to the Emmeline of\r\nDelamere. It would be endless to recount the misfortunes of this noble\r\nand gallant Earl. It is sufficient to say that he was beheaded on the\r\n25th of Feb, after having been Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, after having\r\nclapped his hand on his sword, and after performing many other services\r\nto his Country. Elizabeth did not long survive his loss, and died so\r\nmiserable that were it not an injury to the memory of Mary I should pity\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES the 1st\r\n\r\nThough this King had some faults, among which and as the most principal,\r\nwas his allowing his Mother's death, yet considered on the whole I\r\ncannot help liking him. He married Anne of Denmark, and had several\r\nChildren; fortunately for him his eldest son Prince Henry died before\r\nhis father or he might have experienced the evils which befell his\r\nunfortunate Brother.\r\n\r\nAs I am myself partial to the roman catholic religion, it is with\r\ninfinite regret that I am obliged to blame the Behaviour of any Member\r\nof it: yet Truth being I think very excusable in an Historian, I am\r\nnecessitated to say that in this reign the roman Catholics of England\r\ndid not behave like Gentlemen to the protestants. Their Behaviour\r\nindeed to the Royal Family and both Houses of Parliament might justly\r\nbe considered by them as very uncivil, and even Sir Henry Percy tho'\r\ncertainly the best bred man of the party, had none of that general\r\npoliteness which is so universally pleasing, as his attentions were\r\nentirely confined to Lord Mounteagle.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Raleigh flourished in this and the preceeding reign, and is\r\nby many people held in great veneration and respect--But as he was an\r\nenemy of the noble Essex, I have nothing to say in praise of him, and\r\nmust refer all those who may wish to be acquainted with the particulars\r\nof his life, to Mr Sheridan's play of the Critic, where they will\r\nfind many interesting anecdotes as well of him as of his friend Sir\r\nChristopher Hatton.--His Majesty was of that amiable disposition which\r\ninclines to Freindship, and in such points was possessed of a keener\r\npenetration in discovering Merit than many other people. I once heard an\r\nexcellent Sharade on a Carpet, of which the subject I am now on reminds\r\nme, and as I think it may afford my Readers some amusement to FIND IT\r\nOUT, I shall here take the liberty of presenting it to them.\r\n\r\nSHARADE My first is what my second was to King James the 1st, and you\r\ntread on my whole.\r\n\r\nThe principal favourites of his Majesty were Car, who was afterwards\r\ncreated Earl of Somerset and whose name perhaps may have some share\r\nin the above mentioned Sharade, and George Villiers afterwards Duke of\r\nBuckingham. On his Majesty's death he was succeeded by his son Charles.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES the 1st\r\n\r\nThis amiable Monarch seems born to have suffered misfortunes equal to\r\nthose of his lovely Grandmother; misfortunes which he could not deserve\r\nsince he was her descendant. Never certainly were there before so many\r\ndetestable Characters at one time in England as in this Period of its\r\nHistory; never were amiable men so scarce. The number of them throughout\r\nthe whole Kingdom amounting only to FIVE, besides the inhabitants\r\nof Oxford who were always loyal to their King and faithful to his\r\ninterests. The names of this noble five who never forgot the duty of\r\nthe subject, or swerved from their attachment to his Majesty, were as\r\nfollows--The King himself, ever stedfast in his own support--Archbishop\r\nLaud, Earl of Strafford, Viscount Faulkland and Duke of Ormond, who were\r\nscarcely less strenuous or zealous in the cause. While the VILLIANS\r\nof the time would make too long a list to be written or read; I shall\r\ntherefore content myself with mentioning the leaders of the Gang.\r\nCromwell, Fairfax, Hampden, and Pym may be considered as the original\r\nCausers of all the disturbances, Distresses, and Civil Wars in which\r\nEngland for many years was embroiled. In this reign as well as in that\r\nof Elizabeth, I am obliged in spite of my attachment to the Scotch,\r\nto consider them as equally guilty with the generality of the English,\r\nsince they dared to think differently from their Sovereign, to forget\r\nthe Adoration which as STUARTS it was their Duty to pay them, to rebel\r\nagainst, dethrone and imprison the unfortunate Mary; to oppose, to\r\ndeceive, and to sell the no less unfortunate Charles. The Events of this\r\nMonarch's reign are too numerous for my pen, and indeed the recital\r\nof any Events (except what I make myself) is uninteresting to me; my\r\nprincipal reason for undertaking the History of England being to Prove\r\nthe innocence of the Queen of Scotland, which I flatter myself with\r\nhaving effectually done, and to abuse Elizabeth, tho' I am rather\r\nfearful of having fallen short in the latter part of my scheme.--As\r\ntherefore it is not my intention to give any particular account of the\r\ndistresses into which this King was involved through the misconduct and\r\nCruelty of his Parliament, I shall satisfy myself with vindicating him\r\nfrom the Reproach of Arbitrary and tyrannical Government with which he\r\nhas often been charged. This, I feel, is not difficult to be done, for\r\nwith one argument I am certain of satisfying every sensible and well\r\ndisposed person whose opinions have been properly guided by a good\r\nEducation--and this Argument is that he was a STUART.\r\n\r\nFinis Saturday Nov: 26th 1791.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA COLLECTION OF LETTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Miss COOPER\r\n\r\nCOUSIN Conscious of the Charming Character which in every Country, and\r\nevery Clime in Christendom is Cried, Concerning you, with Caution and\r\nCare I Commend to your Charitable Criticism this Clever Collection\r\nof Curious Comments, which have been Carefully Culled, Collected and\r\nClassed by your Comical Cousin\r\n\r\nThe Author.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA COLLECTION OF LETTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the FIRST From a MOTHER to her FREIND.\r\n\r\nMy Children begin now to claim all my attention in different Manner from\r\nthat in which they have been used to receive it, as they are now arrived\r\nat that age when it is necessary for them in some measure to become\r\nconversant with the World, My Augusta is 17 and her sister scarcely a\r\ntwelvemonth younger. I flatter myself that their education has been such\r\nas will not disgrace their appearance in the World, and that THEY will\r\nnot disgrace their Education I have every reason to beleive. Indeed they\r\nare sweet Girls--. Sensible yet unaffected--Accomplished yet Easy--.\r\nLively yet Gentle--. As their progress in every thing they have learnt\r\nhas been always the same, I am willing to forget the difference of age,\r\nand to introduce them together into Public. This very Evening is fixed\r\non as their first ENTREE into Life, as we are to drink tea with Mrs Cope\r\nand her Daughter. I am glad that we are to meet no one, for my Girls\r\nsake, as it would be awkward for them to enter too wide a Circle on the\r\nvery first day. But we shall proceed by degrees.--Tomorrow Mr Stanly's\r\nfamily will drink tea with us, and perhaps the Miss Phillips's will meet\r\nthem. On Tuesday we shall pay Morning Visits--On Wednesday we are to\r\ndine at Westbrook. On Thursday we have Company at home. On Friday we\r\nare to be at a Private Concert at Sir John Wynna's--and on Saturday\r\nwe expect Miss Dawson to call in the Morning--which will complete my\r\nDaughters Introduction into Life. How they will bear so much dissipation\r\nI cannot imagine; of their spirits I have no fear, I only dread their\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nThis mighty affair is now happily over, and my Girls are OUT. As the\r\nmoment approached for our departure, you can have no idea how the sweet\r\nCreatures trembled with fear and expectation. Before the Carriage drove\r\nto the door, I called them into my dressing-room, and as soon as they\r\nwere seated thus addressed them. \u201cMy dear Girls the moment is now\r\narrived when I am to reap the rewards of all my Anxieties and Labours\r\ntowards you during your Education. You are this Evening to enter a World\r\nin which you will meet with many wonderfull Things; Yet let me warn\r\nyou against suffering yourselves to be meanly swayed by the Follies and\r\nVices of others, for beleive me my beloved Children that if you do--I\r\nshall be very sorry for it.\u201d They both assured me that they would ever\r\nremember my advice with Gratitude, and follow it with attention; That\r\nthey were prepared to find a World full of things to amaze and to shock\r\nthem: but that they trusted their behaviour would never give me reason\r\nto repent the Watchful Care with which I had presided over their infancy\r\nand formed their Minds--\u201d \u201cWith such expectations and such intentions\r\n(cried I) I can have nothing to fear from you--and can chearfully\r\nconduct you to Mrs Cope's without a fear of your being seduced by her\r\nExample, or contaminated by her Follies. Come, then my Children (added\r\nI) the Carriage is driving to the door, and I will not a moment delay\r\nthe happiness you are so impatient to enjoy.\u201d When we arrived at\r\nWarleigh, poor Augusta could scarcely breathe, while Margaret was all\r\nLife and Rapture. \u201cThe long-expected Moment is now arrived (said she)\r\nand we shall soon be in the World.\u201d--In a few Moments we were in Mrs\r\nCope's parlour, where with her daughter she sate ready to receive us.\r\nI observed with delight the impression my Children made on them--. They\r\nwere indeed two sweet, elegant-looking Girls, and tho' somewhat abashed\r\nfrom the peculiarity of their situation, yet there was an ease in their\r\nManners and address which could not fail of pleasing--. Imagine my\r\ndear Madam how delighted I must have been in beholding as I did, how\r\nattentively they observed every object they saw, how disgusted with some\r\nThings, how enchanted with others, how astonished at all! On the whole\r\nhowever they returned in raptures with the World, its Inhabitants, and\r\nManners. Yrs Ever--A. F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the SECOND From a YOUNG LADY crossed in Love to her freind\r\n\r\nWhy should this last disappointment hang so heavily on my spirits? Why\r\nshould I feel it more, why should it wound me deeper than those I\r\nhave experienced before? Can it be that I have a greater affection for\r\nWilloughby than I had for his amiable predecessors? Or is it that our\r\nfeelings become more acute from being often wounded? I must suppose my\r\ndear Belle that this is the Case, since I am not conscious of being more\r\nsincerely attached to Willoughby than I was to Neville, Fitzowen, or\r\neither of the Crawfords, for all of whom I once felt the most lasting\r\naffection that ever warmed a Woman's heart. Tell me then dear Belle why\r\nI still sigh when I think of the faithless Edward, or why I weep when I\r\nbehold his Bride, for too surely this is the case--. My Freinds are all\r\nalarmed for me; They fear my declining health; they lament my want\r\nof spirits; they dread the effects of both. In hopes of releiving my\r\nmelancholy, by directing my thoughts to other objects, they have invited\r\nseveral of their freinds to spend the Christmas with us. Lady Bridget\r\nDarkwood and her sister-in-law, Miss Jane are expected on Friday; and\r\nColonel Seaton's family will be with us next week. This is all most\r\nkindly meant by my Uncle and Cousins; but what can the presence of a\r\ndozen indefferent people do to me, but weary and distress me--. I will\r\nnot finish my Letter till some of our Visitors are arrived.\r\n\r\nFriday Evening Lady Bridget came this morning, and with her, her sweet\r\nsister Miss Jane--. Although I have been acquainted with this charming\r\nWoman above fifteen Years, yet I never before observed how lovely she\r\nis. She is now about 35, and in spite of sickness, sorrow and Time is\r\nmore blooming than I ever saw a Girl of 17. I was delighted with her,\r\nthe moment she entered the house, and she appeared equally pleased with\r\nme, attaching herself to me during the remainder of the day. There is\r\nsomething so sweet, so mild in her Countenance, that she seems more than\r\nMortal. Her Conversation is as bewitching as her appearance; I could not\r\nhelp telling her how much she engaged my admiration--. \u201cOh! Miss Jane\r\n(said I)--and stopped from an inability at the moment of expressing\r\nmyself as I could wish--Oh! Miss Jane--(I repeated)--I could not think\r\nof words to suit my feelings--She seemed waiting for my speech--. I\r\nwas confused--distressed--my thoughts were bewildered--and I could only\r\nadd--\u201cHow do you do?\u201d She saw and felt for my Embarrassment and with\r\nadmirable presence of mind releived me from it by saying--\u201cMy dear\r\nSophia be not uneasy at having exposed yourself--I will turn the\r\nConversation without appearing to notice it. \u201cOh! how I loved her for\r\nher kindness!\u201d Do you ride as much as you used to do?\u201d said she--. \u201cI\r\nam advised to ride by my Physician. We have delightful Rides round us,\r\nI have a Charming horse, am uncommonly fond of the Amusement, replied\r\nI quite recovered from my Confusion, and in short I ride a great deal.\u201d\r\n \u201cYou are in the right my Love,\u201d said she. Then repeating the following\r\nline which was an extempore and equally adapted to recommend both Riding\r\nand Candour--\r\n\r\n\u201cRide where you may, Be Candid where you can,\u201d she added,\u201d I rode once,\r\nbut it is many years ago--She spoke this in so low and tremulous a\r\nVoice, that I was silent--. Struck with her Manner of speaking I could\r\nmake no reply. \u201cI have not ridden, continued she fixing her Eyes on my\r\nface, since I was married.\u201d I was never so surprised--\u201cMarried, Ma'am!\u201d\r\n I repeated. \u201cYou may well wear that look of astonishment, said she,\r\nsince what I have said must appear improbable to you--Yet nothing is\r\nmore true than that I once was married.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen why are you called Miss Jane?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI married, my Sophia without the consent or knowledge of my father the\r\nlate Admiral Annesley. It was therefore necessary to keep the secret\r\nfrom him and from every one, till some fortunate opportunity might offer\r\nof revealing it--. Such an opportunity alas! was but too soon given in\r\nthe death of my dear Capt. Dashwood--Pardon these tears, continued Miss\r\nJane wiping her Eyes, I owe them to my Husband's memory. He fell my\r\nSophia, while fighting for his Country in America after a most happy\r\nUnion of seven years--. My Children, two sweet Boys and a Girl, who\r\nhad constantly resided with my Father and me, passing with him and with\r\nevery one as the Children of a Brother (tho' I had ever been an only\r\nChild) had as yet been the comforts of my Life. But no sooner had\r\nI lossed my Henry, than these sweet Creatures fell sick and died--.\r\nConceive dear Sophia what my feelings must have been when as an Aunt I\r\nattended my Children to their early Grave--. My Father did not survive\r\nthem many weeks--He died, poor Good old man, happily ignorant to his\r\nlast hour of my Marriage.'\r\n\r\n\u201cBut did not you own it, and assume his name at your husband's death?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; I could not bring myself to do it; more especially when in my\r\nChildren I lost all inducement for doing it. Lady Bridget, and yourself\r\nare the only persons who are in the knowledge of my having ever been\r\neither Wife or Mother. As I could not Prevail on myself to take the\r\nname of Dashwood (a name which after my Henry's death I could never hear\r\nwithout emotion) and as I was conscious of having no right to that of\r\nAnnesley, I dropt all thoughts of either, and have made it a point of\r\nbearing only my Christian one since my Father's death.\u201d She paused--\u201cOh!\r\nmy dear Miss Jane (said I) how infinitely am I obliged to you for so\r\nentertaining a story! You cannot think how it has diverted me! But have\r\nyou quite done?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have only to add my dear Sophia, that my Henry's elder Brother dieing\r\nabout the same time, Lady Bridget became a Widow like myself, and as we\r\nhad always loved each other in idea from the high Character in which we\r\nhad ever been spoken of, though we had never met, we determined to live\r\ntogether. We wrote to one another on the same subject by the same post,\r\nso exactly did our feeling and our actions coincide! We both eagerly\r\nembraced the proposals we gave and received of becoming one family, and\r\nhave from that time lived together in the greatest affection.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd is this all? said I, I hope you have not done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed I have; and did you ever hear a story more pathetic?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never did--and it is for that reason it pleases me so much, for when\r\none is unhappy nothing is so delightful to one's sensations as to hear\r\nof equal misery.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! but my Sophia why are YOU unhappy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you not heard Madam of Willoughby's Marriage?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut my love why lament HIS perfidy, when you bore so well that of many\r\nyoung Men before?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! Madam, I was used to it then, but when Willoughby broke his\r\nEngagements I had not been dissapointed for half a year.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor Girl!\u201d said Miss Jane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the THIRD From a YOUNG LADY in distressed Circumstances to her\r\nfreind\r\n\r\nA few days ago I was at a private Ball given by Mr Ashburnham. As my\r\nMother never goes out she entrusted me to the care of Lady Greville who\r\ndid me the honour of calling for me in her way and of allowing me to sit\r\nforwards, which is a favour about which I am very indifferent especially\r\nas I know it is considered as confering a great obligation on me \u201cSo\r\nMiss Maria (said her Ladyship as she saw me advancing to the door of the\r\nCarriage) you seem very smart to night--MY poor Girls will appear quite\r\nto disadvantage by YOU--I only hope your Mother may not have distressed\r\nherself to set YOU off. Have you got a new Gown on?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes Ma'am.\u201d replied I with as much indifference as I could assume.\r\n\r\n\u201cAye, and a fine one too I think--(feeling it, as by her permission I\r\nseated myself by her) I dare say it is all very smart--But I must\r\nown, for you know I always speak my mind, that I think it was quite a\r\nneedless piece of expence--Why could not you have worn your old striped\r\none? It is not my way to find fault with People because they are poor,\r\nfor I always think that they are more to be despised and pitied than\r\nblamed for it, especially if they cannot help it, but at the same time I\r\nmust say that in my opinion your old striped Gown would have been quite\r\nfine enough for its Wearer--for to tell you the truth (I always speak my\r\nmind) I am very much afraid that one half of the people in the room will\r\nnot know whether you have a Gown on or not--But I suppose you intend to\r\nmake your fortune to night--. Well, the sooner the better; and I wish\r\nyou success.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed Ma'am I have no such intention--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho ever heard a young Lady own that she was a Fortune-hunter?\u201d Miss\r\nGreville laughed but I am sure Ellen felt for me.\r\n\r\n\u201cWas your Mother gone to bed before you left her?\u201d said her Ladyship.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear Ma'am, said Ellen it is but nine o'clock.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue Ellen, but Candles cost money, and Mrs Williams is too wise to be\r\nextravagant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was just sitting down to supper Ma'am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what had she got for supper?\u201d \u201cI did not observe.\u201d \u201cBread and\r\nCheese I suppose.\u201d \u201cI should never wish for a better supper.\u201d said\r\nEllen. \u201cYou have never any reason replied her Mother, as a better is\r\nalways provided for you.\u201d Miss Greville laughed excessively, as she\r\nconstantly does at her Mother's wit.\r\n\r\nSuch is the humiliating Situation in which I am forced to appear while\r\nriding in her Ladyship's Coach--I dare not be impertinent, as my Mother\r\nis always admonishing me to be humble and patient if I wish to make my\r\nway in the world. She insists on my accepting every invitation of Lady\r\nGreville, or you may be certain that I would never enter either her\r\nHouse, or her Coach with the disagreable certainty I always have of\r\nbeing abused for my Poverty while I am in them.--When we arrived at\r\nAshburnham, it was nearly ten o'clock, which was an hour and a half\r\nlater than we were desired to be there; but Lady Greville is too\r\nfashionable (or fancies herself to be so) to be punctual. The Dancing\r\nhowever was not begun as they waited for Miss Greville. I had not been\r\nlong in the room before I was engaged to dance by Mr Bernard, but just\r\nas we were going to stand up, he recollected that his Servant had got\r\nhis white Gloves, and immediately ran out to fetch them. In the mean\r\ntime the Dancing began and Lady Greville in passing to another room went\r\nexactly before me--She saw me and instantly stopping, said to me though\r\nthere were several people close to us,\r\n\r\n\u201cHey day, Miss Maria! What cannot you get a partner? Poor Young Lady!\r\nI am afraid your new Gown was put on for nothing. But do not despair;\r\nperhaps you may get a hop before the Evening is over.\u201d So saying, she\r\npassed on without hearing my repeated assurance of being engaged, and\r\nleaving me very much provoked at being so exposed before every one--Mr\r\nBernard however soon returned and by coming to me the moment he entered\r\nthe room, and leading me to the Dancers my Character I hope was cleared\r\nfrom the imputation Lady Greville had thrown on it, in the eyes of all\r\nthe old Ladies who had heard her speech. I soon forgot all my vexations\r\nin the pleasure of dancing and of having the most agreable partner in\r\nthe room. As he is moreover heir to a very large Estate I could see that\r\nLady Greville did not look very well pleased when she found who had been\r\nhis Choice--She was determined to mortify me, and accordingly when we\r\nwere sitting down between the dances, she came to me with more than her\r\nusual insulting importance attended by Miss Mason and said loud enough\r\nto be heard by half the people in the room, \u201cPray Miss Maria in what\r\nway of business was your Grandfather? for Miss Mason and I cannot agree\r\nwhether he was a Grocer or a Bookbinder.\u201d I saw that she wanted to\r\nmortify me, and was resolved if I possibly could to Prevent her seeing\r\nthat her scheme succeeded. \u201cNeither Madam; he was a Wine Merchant.\u201d\r\n \u201cAye, I knew he was in some such low way--He broke did not he?\u201d \u201cI\r\nbeleive not Ma'am.\u201d \u201cDid not he abscond?\u201d \u201cI never heard that he did.\u201d\r\n \u201cAt least he died insolvent?\u201d \u201cI was never told so before.\u201d \u201cWhy, was\r\nnot your FATHER as poor as a Rat\u201d \u201cI fancy not.\u201d \u201cWas not he in the\r\nKings Bench once?\u201d \u201cI never saw him there.\u201d She gave me SUCH a look, and\r\nturned away in a great passion; while I was half delighted with myself\r\nfor my impertinence, and half afraid of being thought too saucy. As Lady\r\nGreville was extremely angry with me, she took no further notice of\r\nme all the Evening, and indeed had I been in favour I should have been\r\nequally neglected, as she was got into a Party of great folks and she\r\nnever speaks to me when she can to anyone else. Miss Greville was with\r\nher Mother's party at supper, but Ellen preferred staying with the\r\nBernards and me. We had a very pleasant Dance and as Lady G--slept all\r\nthe way home, I had a very comfortable ride.\r\n\r\nThe next day while we were at dinner Lady Greville's Coach stopped at\r\nthe door, for that is the time of day she generally contrives it should.\r\nShe sent in a message by the servant to say that \u201cshe should not get out\r\nbut that Miss Maria must come to the Coach-door, as she wanted to speak\r\nto her, and that she must make haste and come immediately--\u201d \u201cWhat an\r\nimpertinent Message Mama!\u201d said I--\u201cGo Maria--\u201d replied she--Accordingly\r\nI went and was obliged to stand there at her Ladyships pleasure though\r\nthe Wind was extremely high and very cold.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy I think Miss Maria you are not quite so smart as you were last\r\nnight--But I did not come to examine your dress, but to tell you that\r\nyou may dine with us the day after tomorrow--Not tomorrow, remember, do\r\nnot come tomorrow, for we expect Lord and Lady Clermont and Sir Thomas\r\nStanley's family--There will be no occasion for your being very fine\r\nfor I shant send the Carriage--If it rains you may take an umbrella--\u201d\r\n I could hardly help laughing at hearing her give me leave to keep myself\r\ndry--\u201cAnd pray remember to be in time, for I shant wait--I hate my\r\nVictuals over-done--But you need not come before the time--How does\r\nyour Mother do? She is at dinner is not she?\u201d \u201cYes Ma'am we were in the\r\nmiddle of dinner when your Ladyship came.\u201d \u201cI am afraid you find it very\r\ncold Maria.\u201d said Ellen. \u201cYes, it is an horrible East wind--said her\r\nMother--I assure you I can hardly bear the window down--But you are used\r\nto be blown about by the wind Miss Maria and that is what has made your\r\nComplexion so rudely and coarse. You young Ladies who cannot often ride\r\nin a Carriage never mind what weather you trudge in, or how the wind\r\nshews your legs. I would not have my Girls stand out of doors as you do\r\nin such a day as this. But some sort of people have no feelings either\r\nof cold or Delicacy--Well, remember that we shall expect you on Thursday\r\nat 5 o'clock--You must tell your Maid to come for you at night--There\r\nwill be no Moon--and you will have an horrid walk home--My compts to\r\nYour Mother--I am afraid your dinner will be cold--Drive on--\u201d And away\r\nshe went, leaving me in a great passion with her as she always does.\r\nMaria Williams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the FOURTH From a YOUNG LADY rather impertinent to her freind\r\n\r\nWe dined yesterday with Mr Evelyn where we were introduced to a very\r\nagreable looking Girl his Cousin. I was extremely pleased with her\r\nappearance, for added to the charms of an engaging face, her manner and\r\nvoice had something peculiarly interesting in them. So much so, that\r\nthey inspired me with a great curiosity to know the history of her Life,\r\nwho were her Parents, where she came from, and what had befallen her,\r\nfor it was then only known that she was a relation of Mr Evelyn, and\r\nthat her name was Grenville. In the evening a favourable opportunity\r\noffered to me of attempting at least to know what I wished to know, for\r\nevery one played at Cards but Mrs Evelyn, My Mother, Dr Drayton, Miss\r\nGrenville and myself, and as the two former were engaged in a whispering\r\nConversation, and the Doctor fell asleep, we were of necessity obliged\r\nto entertain each other. This was what I wished and being determined not\r\nto remain in ignorance for want of asking, I began the Conversation in\r\nthe following Manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you been long in Essex Ma'am?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI arrived on Tuesday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou came from Derbyshire?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, Ma'am! appearing surprised at my question, from Suffolk.\u201d You will\r\nthink this a good dash of mine my dear Mary, but you know that I am not\r\nwanting for Impudence when I have any end in veiw. \u201cAre you pleased with\r\nthe Country Miss Grenville? Do you find it equal to the one you have\r\nleft?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMuch superior Ma'am in point of Beauty.\u201d She sighed. I longed to know\r\nfor why.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the face of any Country however beautiful said I, can be but a poor\r\nconsolation for the loss of one's dearest Freinds.\u201d She shook her\r\nhead, as if she felt the truth of what I said. My Curiosity was so much\r\nraised, that I was resolved at any rate to satisfy it.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou regret having left Suffolk then Miss Grenville?\u201d \u201cIndeed I do.\u201d\r\n \u201cYou were born there I suppose?\u201d \u201cYes Ma'am I was and passed many happy\r\nyears there--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a great comfort--said I--I hope Ma'am that you never spent any\r\nunhappy one's there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerfect Felicity is not the property of Mortals, and no one has a right\r\nto expect uninterrupted Happiness.--Some Misfortunes I have certainly\r\nmet with.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWHAT Misfortunes dear Ma'am? replied I, burning with impatience to know\r\nevery thing. \u201cNONE Ma'am I hope that have been the effect of any wilfull\r\nfault in me.\u201d \u201cI dare say not Ma'am, and have no doubt but that any\r\nsufferings you may have experienced could arise only from the cruelties\r\nof Relations or the Errors of Freinds.\u201d She sighed--\u201cYou seem unhappy\r\nmy dear Miss Grenville--Is it in my power to soften your Misfortunes?\u201d\r\n \u201cYOUR power Ma'am replied she extremely surprised; it is in NO ONES\r\npower to make me happy.\u201d She pronounced these words in so mournfull and\r\nsolemn an accent, that for some time I had not courage to reply. I\r\nwas actually silenced. I recovered myself however in a few moments and\r\nlooking at her with all the affection I could, \u201cMy dear Miss Grenville\r\nsaid I, you appear extremely young--and may probably stand in need of\r\nsome one's advice whose regard for you, joined to superior Age, perhaps\r\nsuperior Judgement might authorise her to give it. I am that person, and\r\nI now challenge you to accept the offer I make you of my Confidence and\r\nFreindship, in return to which I shall only ask for yours--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are extremely obliging Ma'am--said she--and I am highly flattered\r\nby your attention to me--But I am in no difficulty, no doubt, no\r\nuncertainty of situation in which any advice can be wanted. Whenever I\r\nam however continued she brightening into a complaisant smile, I shall\r\nknow where to apply.\u201d\r\n\r\nI bowed, but felt a good deal mortified by such a repulse; still however\r\nI had not given up my point. I found that by the appearance of sentiment\r\nand Freindship nothing was to be gained and determined therefore to\r\nrenew my attacks by Questions and suppositions. \u201cDo you intend staying\r\nlong in this part of England Miss Grenville?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes Ma'am, some time I beleive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how will Mr and Mrs Grenville bear your absence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are neither of them alive Ma'am.\u201d This was an answer I did not\r\nexpect--I was quite silenced, and never felt so awkward in my Life---.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the FIFTH From a YOUNG LADY very much in love to her Freind\r\n\r\nMy Uncle gets more stingy, my Aunt more particular, and I more in love\r\nevery day. What shall we all be at this rate by the end of the year! I\r\nhad this morning the happiness of receiving the following Letter from my\r\ndear Musgrove.\r\n\r\nSackville St: Janry 7th It is a month to day since I first beheld my\r\nlovely Henrietta, and the sacred anniversary must and shall be kept in\r\na manner becoming the day--by writing to her. Never shall I forget the\r\nmoment when her Beauties first broke on my sight--No time as you well\r\nknow can erase it from my Memory. It was at Lady Scudamores. Happy Lady\r\nScudamore to live within a mile of the divine Henrietta! When the lovely\r\nCreature first entered the room, oh! what were my sensations? The sight\r\nof you was like the sight ofa wonderful fine Thing. I started--I gazed\r\nat her with admiration--She appeared every moment more Charming, and the\r\nunfortunate Musgrove became a captive to your Charms before I had time\r\nto look about me. Yes Madam, I had the happiness of adoring you, an\r\nhappiness for which I cannot be too grateful. \u201cWhat said he to himself\r\nis Musgrove allowed to die for Henrietta? Enviable Mortal! and may he\r\npine for her who is the object of universal admiration, who is adored\r\nby a Colonel, and toasted by a Baronet! Adorable Henrietta how beautiful\r\nyou are! I declare you are quite divine! You are more than Mortal.\r\nYou are an Angel. You are Venus herself. In short Madam you are the\r\nprettiest Girl I ever saw in my Life--and her Beauty is encreased in her\r\nMusgroves Eyes, by permitting him to love her and allowing me to hope.\r\nAnd ah! Angelic Miss Henrietta Heaven is my witness how ardently I do\r\nhope for the death of your villanous Uncle and his abandoned Wife, since\r\nmy fair one will not consent to be mine till their decease has placed\r\nher in affluence above what my fortune can procure--. Though it is an\r\nimprovable Estate--. Cruel Henrietta to persist in such a resolution! I\r\nam at Present with my sister where I mean to continue till my own house\r\nwhich tho' an excellent one is at Present somewhat out of repair, is\r\nready to receive me. Amiable princess of my Heart farewell--Of that\r\nHeart which trembles while it signs itself Your most ardent Admirer and\r\ndevoted humble servt. T. Musgrove.\r\n\r\nThere is a pattern for a Love-letter Matilda! Did you ever read such\r\na master-piece of Writing? Such sense, such sentiment, such purity of\r\nThought, such flow of Language and such unfeigned Love in one sheet?\r\nNo, never I can answer for it, since a Musgrove is not to be met with\r\nby every Girl. Oh! how I long to be with him! I intend to send him the\r\nfollowing in answer to his Letter tomorrow.\r\n\r\nMy dearest Musgrove--. Words cannot express how happy your Letter made\r\nme; I thought I should have cried for joy, for I love you better than\r\nany body in the World. I think you the most amiable, and the handsomest\r\nMan in England, and so to be sure you are. I never read so sweet a\r\nLetter in my Life. Do write me another just like it, and tell me you are\r\nin love with me in every other line. I quite die to see you. How shall\r\nwe manage to see one another? for we are so much in love that we cannot\r\nlive asunder. Oh! my dear Musgrove you cannot think how impatiently I\r\nwait for the death of my Uncle and Aunt--If they will not Die soon, I\r\nbeleive I shall run mad, for I get more in love with you every day of my\r\nLife.\r\n\r\nHow happy your Sister is to enjoy the pleasure of your Company in her\r\nhouse, and how happy every body in London must be because you are there.\r\nI hope you will be so kind as to write to me again soon, for I never\r\nread such sweet Letters as yours. I am my dearest Musgrove most truly\r\nand faithfully yours for ever and ever Henrietta Halton.\r\n\r\nI hope he will like my answer; it is as good a one as I can write\r\nthough nothing to his; Indeed I had always heard what a dab he was at\r\na Love-letter. I saw him you know for the first time at Lady\r\nScudamores--And when I saw her Ladyship afterwards she asked me how I\r\nliked her Cousin Musgrove?\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy upon my word said I, I think he is a very handsome young Man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am glad you think so replied she, for he is distractedly in love with\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLaw! Lady Scudamore said I, how can you talk so ridiculously?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay, t'is very true answered she, I assure you, for he was in love with\r\nyou from the first moment he beheld you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish it may be true said I, for that is the only kind of love I\r\nwould give a farthing for--There is some sense in being in love at first\r\nsight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I give you Joy of your conquest, replied Lady Scudamore, and\r\nI beleive it to have been a very complete one; I am sure it is not a\r\ncontemptible one, for my Cousin is a charming young fellow, has seen a\r\ngreat deal of the World, and writes the best Love-letters I ever read.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis made me very happy, and I was excessively pleased with my conquest.\r\nHowever, I thought it was proper to give myself a few Airs--so I said to\r\nher--\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is all very pretty Lady Scudamore, but you know that we young\r\nLadies who are Heiresses must not throw ourselves away upon Men who have\r\nno fortune at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Miss Halton said she, I am as much convinced of that as you can\r\nbe, and I do assure you that I should be the last person to encourage\r\nyour marrying anyone who had not some pretensions to expect a fortune\r\nwith you. Mr Musgrove is so far from being poor that he has an estate of\r\nseveral hundreds an year which is capable of great Improvement, and an\r\nexcellent House, though at Present it is not quite in repair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf that is the case replied I, I have nothing more to say against\r\nhim, and if as you say he is an informed young Man and can write a\r\ngood Love-letter, I am sure I have no reason to find fault with him\r\nfor admiring me, tho' perhaps I may not marry him for all that Lady\r\nScudamore.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are certainly under no obligation to marry him answered her\r\nLadyship, except that which love himself will dictate to you, for if I\r\nam not greatly mistaken you are at this very moment unknown to yourself,\r\ncherishing a most tender affection for him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLaw, Lady Scudamore replied I blushing how can you think of such a\r\nthing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause every look, every word betrays it, answered she; Come my dear\r\nHenrietta, consider me as a freind, and be sincere with me--Do not you\r\nprefer Mr Musgrove to any man of your acquaintance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray do not ask me such questions Lady Scudamore, said I turning away\r\nmy head, for it is not fit for me to answer them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay my Love replied she, now you confirm my suspicions. But why\r\nHenrietta should you be ashamed to own a well-placed Love, or why refuse\r\nto confide in me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am not ashamed to own it; said I taking Courage. I do not refuse to\r\nconfide in you or blush to say that I do love your cousin Mr Musgrove,\r\nthat I am sincerely attached to him, for it is no disgrace to love a\r\nhandsome Man. If he were plain indeed I might have had reason to be\r\nashamed of a passion which must have been mean since the object would\r\nhave been unworthy. But with such a figure and face, and such beautiful\r\nhair as your Cousin has, why should I blush to own that such superior\r\nmerit has made an impression on me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy sweet Girl (said Lady Scudamore embracing me with great affection)\r\nwhat a delicate way of thinking you have in these matters, and what a\r\nquick discernment for one of your years! Oh! how I honour you for such\r\nNoble Sentiments!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you Ma'am said I; You are vastly obliging. But pray Lady Scudamore\r\ndid your Cousin himself tell you of his affection for me I shall like\r\nhim the better if he did, for what is a Lover without a Confidante?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! my Love replied she, you were born for each other. Every word\r\nyou say more deeply convinces me that your Minds are actuated by the\r\ninvisible power of simpathy, for your opinions and sentiments so exactly\r\ncoincide. Nay, the colour of your Hair is not very different. Yes my\r\ndear Girl, the poor despairing Musgrove did reveal to me the story of\r\nhis Love--. Nor was I surprised at it--I know not how it was, but I had\r\na kind of presentiment that he would be in love with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, but how did he break it to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was not till after supper. We were sitting round the fire\r\ntogether talking on indifferent subjects, though to say the truth the\r\nConversation was cheifly on my side for he was thoughtful and silent,\r\nwhen on a sudden he interrupted me in the midst of something I was\r\nsaying, by exclaiming in a most Theatrical tone--\r\n\r\nYes I'm in love I feel it now And Henrietta Halton has undone me\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! What a sweet way replied I, of declaring his Passion! To make such\r\na couple of charming lines about me! What a pity it is that they are not\r\nin rhime!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am very glad you like it answered she; To be sure there was a great\r\ndeal of Taste in it. And are you in love with her, Cousin? said I. I am\r\nvery sorry for it, for unexceptionable as you are in every respect, with\r\na pretty Estate capable of Great improvements, and an excellent House\r\ntho' somewhat out of repair, yet who can hope to aspire with success\r\nto the adorable Henrietta who has had an offer from a Colonel and\r\nbeen toasted by a Baronet\u201d--\u201cTHAT I have--\u201d cried I. Lady Scudamore\r\ncontinued. \u201cAh dear Cousin replied he, I am so well convinced of the\r\nlittle Chance I can have of winning her who is adored by thousands, that\r\nI need no assurances of yours to make me more thoroughly so. Yet surely\r\nneither you or the fair Henrietta herself will deny me the exquisite\r\nGratification of dieing for her, of falling a victim to her Charms. And\r\nwhen I am dead\u201d--continued her--\r\n\r\n\u201cOh Lady Scudamore, said I wiping my eyes, that such a sweet Creature\r\nshould talk of dieing!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is an affecting Circumstance indeed, replied Lady Scudamore.\u201d \u201cWhen\r\nI am dead said he, let me be carried and lain at her feet, and perhaps\r\nshe may not disdain to drop a pitying tear on my poor remains.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear Lady Scudamore interrupted I, say no more on this affecting\r\nsubject. I cannot bear it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! how I admire the sweet sensibility of your Soul, and as I would not\r\nfor Worlds wound it too deeply, I will be silent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray go on.\u201d said I. She did so.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then added he, Ah! Cousin imagine what my transports will be when\r\nI feel the dear precious drops trickle on my face! Who would not die\r\nto haste such extacy! And when I am interred, may the divine Henrietta\r\nbless some happier Youth with her affection, May he be as tenderly\r\nattached to her as the hapless Musgrove and while HE crumbles to dust,\r\nMay they live an example of Felicity in the Conjugal state!\u201d\r\n\r\nDid you ever hear any thing so pathetic? What a charming wish, to be\r\nlain at my feet when he was dead! Oh! what an exalted mind he must have\r\nto be capable of such a wish! Lady Scudamore went on.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! my dear Cousin replied I to him, such noble behaviour as this, must\r\nmelt the heart of any woman however obdurate it may naturally be;\r\nand could the divine Henrietta but hear your generous wishes for her\r\nhappiness, all gentle as is her mind, I have not a doubt but that she\r\nwould pity your affection and endeavour to return it.\u201d \u201cOh! Cousin\r\nanswered he, do not endeavour to raise my hopes by such flattering\r\nassurances. No, I cannot hope to please this angel of a Woman, and the\r\nonly thing which remains for me to do, is to die.\u201d \u201cTrue Love is ever\r\ndesponding replied I, but I my dear Tom will give you even greater\r\nhopes of conquering this fair one's heart, than I have yet given you, by\r\nassuring you that I watched her with the strictest attention during the\r\nwhole day, and could plainly discover that she cherishes in her bosom\r\nthough unknown to herself, a most tender affection for you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear Lady Scudamore cried I, This is more than I ever knew!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid not I say that it was unknown to yourself? I did not, continued\r\nI to him, encourage you by saying this at first, that surprise might\r\nrender the pleasure still Greater.\u201d \u201cNo Cousin replied he in a languid\r\nvoice, nothing will convince me that I can have touched the heart of\r\nHenrietta Halton, and if you are deceived yourself, do not attempt\r\ndeceiving me.\u201d \u201cIn short my Love it was the work of some hours for me to\r\nPersuade the poor despairing Youth that you had really a preference for\r\nhim; but when at last he could no longer deny the force of my arguments,\r\nor discredit what I told him, his transports, his Raptures, his Extacies\r\nare beyond my power to describe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! the dear Creature, cried I, how passionately he loves me! But dear\r\nLady Scudamore did you tell him that I was totally dependant on my Uncle\r\nand Aunt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I told him every thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what did he say.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe exclaimed with virulence against Uncles and Aunts; Accused the laws\r\nof England for allowing them to Possess their Estates when wanted by\r\ntheir Nephews or Neices, and wished HE were in the House of Commons,\r\nthat he might reform the Legislature, and rectify all its abuses.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! the sweet Man! What a spirit he has!\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe could not flatter himself he added, that the adorable Henrietta\r\nwould condescend for his sake to resign those Luxuries and that splendor\r\nto which she had been used, and accept only in exchange the Comforts\r\nand Elegancies which his limited Income could afford her, even supposing\r\nthat his house were in Readiness to receive her. I told him that it\r\ncould not be expected that she would; it would be doing her an injustice\r\nto suppose her capable of giving up the power she now possesses and so\r\nnobly uses of doing such extensive Good to the poorer part of her fellow\r\nCreatures, merely for the gratification of you and herself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure said I, I AM very Charitable every now and then. And what\r\ndid Mr Musgrove say to this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe replied that he was under a melancholy necessity of owning the truth\r\nof what I said, and that therefore if he should be the happy Creature\r\ndestined to be the Husband of the Beautiful Henrietta he must bring\r\nhimself to wait, however impatiently, for the fortunate day, when she\r\nmight be freed from the power of worthless Relations and able to bestow\r\nherself on him.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat a noble Creature he is! Oh! Matilda what a fortunate one I am, who\r\nam to be his Wife! My Aunt is calling me to come and make the pies, so\r\nadeiu my dear freind, and beleive me yours etc--H. Halton.\r\n\r\nFinis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCRAPS\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Miss FANNY CATHERINE AUSTEN\r\n\r\nMY Dear Neice As I am prevented by the great distance between Rowling\r\nand Steventon from superintending your Education myself, the care of\r\nwhich will probably on that account devolve on your Father and Mother,\r\nI think it is my particular Duty to Prevent your feeling as much as\r\npossible the want of my personal instructions, by addressing to you on\r\npaper my Opinions and Admonitions on the conduct of Young Women, which\r\nyou will find expressed in the following pages.--I am my dear Neice Your\r\naffectionate Aunt The Author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEMALE PHILOSOPHER\r\n\r\nA LETTER\r\n\r\nMy Dear Louisa Your friend Mr Millar called upon us yesterday in his way\r\nto Bath, whither he is going for his health; two of his daughters were\r\nwith him, but the eldest and the three Boys are with their Mother in\r\nSussex. Though you have often told me that Miss Millar was remarkably\r\nhandsome, you never mentioned anything of her Sisters' beauty; yet they\r\nare certainly extremely pretty. I'll give you their description.--Julia\r\nis eighteen; with a countenance in which Modesty, Sense and Dignity are\r\nhappily blended, she has a form which at once presents you with Grace,\r\nElegance and Symmetry. Charlotte who is just sixteen is shorter than her\r\nSister, and though her figure cannot boast the easy dignity of\r\nJulia's, yet it has a pleasing plumpness which is in a different way as\r\nestimable. She is fair and her face is expressive sometimes of softness\r\nthe most bewitching, and at others of Vivacity the most striking.\r\nShe appears to have infinite Wit and a good humour unalterable; her\r\nconversation during the half hour they set with us, was replete with\r\nhumourous sallies, Bonmots and repartees; while the sensible, the\r\namiable Julia uttered sentiments of Morality worthy of a heart like her\r\nown. Mr Millar appeared to answer the character I had always received\r\nof him. My Father met him with that look of Love, that social Shake, and\r\ncordial kiss which marked his gladness at beholding an old and valued\r\nfreind from whom thro' various circumstances he had been separated\r\nnearly twenty years. Mr Millar observed (and very justly too) that\r\nmany events had befallen each during that interval of time, which gave\r\noccasion to the lovely Julia for making most sensible reflections on the\r\nmany changes in their situation which so long a period had occasioned,\r\non the advantages of some, and the disadvantages of others. From\r\nthis subject she made a short digression to the instability of human\r\npleasures and the uncertainty of their duration, which led her to\r\nobserve that all earthly Joys must be imperfect. She was proceeding to\r\nillustrate this doctrine by examples from the Lives of great Men when\r\nthe Carriage came to the Door and the amiable Moralist with her Father\r\nand Sister was obliged to depart; but not without a promise of spending\r\nfive or six months with us on their return. We of course mentioned you,\r\nand I assure you that ample Justice was done to your Merits by all.\r\n\u201cLouisa Clarke (said I) is in general a very pleasant Girl, yet\r\nsometimes her good humour is clouded by Peevishness, Envy and Spite. She\r\nneither wants Understanding or is without some pretensions to Beauty,\r\nbut these are so very trifling, that the value she sets on her personal\r\ncharms, and the adoration she expects them to be offered are at once a\r\nstriking example of her vanity, her pride, and her folly.\u201d So said I,\r\nand to my opinion everyone added weight by the concurrence of their own.\r\nYour affectionate Arabella Smythe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST ACT OF A COMEDY\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS Popgun Maria Charles Pistolletta Postilion Hostess Chorus of\r\nploughboys Cook and                      and\r\nStrephon Chloe\r\n\r\nSCENE--AN INN\r\n\r\nENTER Hostess, Charles, Maria, and Cook.\r\n\r\nHostess to Maria) If the gentry in the Lion should want beds, shew them\r\nnumber 9.\r\n\r\nMaria) Yes Mistress.--EXIT Maria\r\n\r\nHostess to Cook) If their Honours in the Moon ask for the bill of fare,\r\ngive it them.\r\n\r\nCook) I wull, I wull.

But I will pawn to you an\r\nundirected Letter that I received from Chloe.\r\n\r\nPost:) Sir, I accept your offer.\r\n\r\nEND OF THE FIRST ACT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LETTER from a YOUNG LADY, whose feelings being too strong for\r\nher Judgement led her into the commission of Errors which her Heart\r\ndisapproved.\r\n\r\nMany have been the cares and vicissitudes of my past life, my beloved\r\nEllinor, and the only consolation I feel for their bitterness is that on\r\na close examination of my conduct, I am convinced that I have strictly\r\ndeserved them. I murdered my father at a very early period of my Life, I\r\nhave since murdered my Mother, and I am now going to murder my Sister. I\r\nhave changed my religion so often that at present I have not an idea of\r\nany left. I have been a perjured witness in every public tryal for these\r\nlast twelve years; and I have forged my own Will. In short there is\r\nscarcely a crime that I have not committed--But I am now going to\r\nreform. Colonel Martin of the Horse guards has paid his Addresses to me,\r\nand we are to be married in a few days. As there is something singular\r\nin our Courtship, I will give you an account of it. Colonel Martin is\r\nthe second son of the late Sir John Martin who died immensely rich, but\r\nbequeathing only one hundred thousand pound apeice to his three younger\r\nChildren, left the bulk of his fortune, about eight Million to the\r\npresent Sir Thomas. Upon his small pittance the Colonel lived tolerably\r\ncontented for nearly four months when he took it into his head to\r\ndetermine on getting the whole of his eldest Brother's Estate. A new\r\nwill was forged and the Colonel produced it in Court--but nobody would\r\nswear to it's being the right will except himself, and he had sworn so\r\nmuch that Nobody beleived him. At that moment I happened to be passing\r\nby the door of the Court, and was beckoned in by the Judge who told the\r\nColonel that I was a Lady ready to witness anything for the cause of\r\nJustice, and advised him to apply to me. In short the Affair was soon\r\nadjusted. The Colonel and I swore to its' being the right will, and Sir\r\nThomas has been obliged to resign all his illgotten wealth. The Colonel\r\nin gratitude waited on me the next day with an offer of his hand--. I am\r\nnow going to murder my Sister. Yours Ever, Anna Parker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TOUR THROUGH WALES--in a LETTER from a YOUNG LADY--\r\n\r\nMy Dear Clara I have been so long on the ramble that I have not till now\r\nhad it in my power to thank you for your Letter--. We left our dear home\r\non last Monday month; and proceeded on our tour through Wales, which is\r\na principality contiguous to England and gives the title to the Prince\r\nof Wales. We travelled on horseback by preference. My Mother rode upon\r\nour little poney and Fanny and I walked by her side or rather ran, for\r\nmy Mother is so fond of riding fast that she galloped all the way. You\r\nmay be sure that we were in a fine perspiration when we came to our\r\nplace of resting. Fanny has taken a great many Drawings of the Country,\r\nwhich are very beautiful, tho' perhaps not such exact resemblances\r\nas might be wished, from their being taken as she ran along. It would\r\nastonish you to see all the Shoes we wore out in our Tour. We determined\r\nto take a good Stock with us and therefore each took a pair of our own\r\nbesides those we set off in. However we were obliged to have them both\r\ncapped and heelpeiced at Carmarthen, and at last when they were quite\r\ngone, Mama was so kind as to lend us a pair of blue Sattin Slippers, of\r\nwhich we each took one and hopped home from Hereford delightfully---I am\r\nyour ever affectionate Elizabeth Johnson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TALE.\r\n\r\nA Gentleman whose family name I shall conceal, bought a small Cottage in\r\nPembrokeshire about two years ago. This daring Action was suggested to\r\nhim by his elder Brother who promised to furnish two rooms and a Closet\r\nfor him, provided he would take a small house near the borders of an\r\nextensive Forest, and about three Miles from the Sea. Wilhelminus gladly\r\naccepted the offer and continued for some time searching after such a\r\nretreat when he was one morning agreably releived from his suspence by\r\nreading this advertisement in a Newspaper.\r\n\r\nTO BE LETT A Neat Cottage on the borders of an extensive forest and\r\nabout three Miles from the Sea. It is ready furnished except two rooms\r\nand a Closet.\r\n\r\nThe delighted Wilhelminus posted away immediately to his brother, and\r\nshewed him the advertisement. Robertus congratulated him and sent him\r\nin his Carriage to take possession of the Cottage. After travelling for\r\nthree days and six nights without stopping, they arrived at the Forest\r\nand following a track which led by it's side down a steep Hill over\r\nwhich ten Rivulets meandered, they reached the Cottage in half an hour.\r\nWilhelminus alighted, and after knocking for some time without receiving\r\nany answer or hearing any one stir within, he opened the door which\r\nwas fastened only by a wooden latch and entered a small room, which he\r\nimmediately perceived to be one of the two that were unfurnished--From\r\nthence he proceeded into a Closet equally bare. A pair of stairs that\r\nwent out of it led him into a room above, no less destitute, and these\r\napartments he found composed the whole of the House. He was by no means\r\ndispleased with this discovery, as he had the comfort of reflecting that\r\nhe should not be obliged to lay out anything on furniture himself--. He\r\nreturned immediately to his Brother, who took him the next day to every\r\nShop in Town, and bought what ever was requisite to furnish the two\r\nrooms and the Closet, In a few days everything was completed, and\r\nWilhelminus returned to take possession of his Cottage. Robertus\r\naccompanied him, with his Lady the amiable Cecilia and her two lovely\r\nSisters Arabella and Marina to whom Wilhelminus was tenderly attached,\r\nand a large number of Attendants.--An ordinary Genius might probably\r\nhave been embarrassed, in endeavouring to accomodate so large a party,\r\nbut Wilhelminus with admirable presence of mind gave orders for the\r\nimmediate erection of two noble Tents in an open spot in the Forest\r\nadjoining to the house. Their Construction was both simple and\r\nelegant--A couple of old blankets, each supported by four sticks, gave\r\na striking proof of that taste for architecture and that happy ease in\r\novercoming difficulties which were some of Wilhelminus's most striking\r\nVirtues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Love And Freindship And Other Early\r\nWorks, by Jane Austen\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LOVE AND FREINDSHIP ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1212-0.txt or 1212-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/2/1/1212/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n",

VERNON\r\n\r\n\r\nLangford, Dec.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BROTHER,--I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of\r\nprofiting by your kind invitation when we last parted of spending some\r\nweeks with you at Churchhill, and, therefore, if quite convenient to you\r\nand Mrs. Vernon to receive me at present, I shall hope within a few\r\ndays to be introduced to a sister whom I have so long desired to be\r\nacquainted with. My kind friends here are most affectionately\r\nurgent with me to prolong my stay, but their hospitable and cheerful\r\ndispositions lead them too much into society for my present situation\r\nand state of mind; and I impatiently look forward to the hour when I\r\nshall be admitted into your delightful retirement.\r\n\r\nI long to be made known to your dear little children, in whose hearts I\r\nshall be very eager to secure an interest I shall soon have need for all\r\nmy fortitude, as I am on the point of separation from my own daughter.\r\nThe long illness of her dear father prevented my paying her that\r\nattention which duty and affection equally dictated, and I have too\r\nmuch reason to fear that the governess to whose care I consigned her was\r\nunequal to the charge. I have therefore resolved on placing her at one\r\nof the best private schools in town, where I shall have an opportunity\r\nof leaving her myself in my way to you. I am determined, you see, not to\r\nbe denied admittance at Churchhill. It would indeed give me most painful\r\nsensations to know that it were not in your power to receive me.\r\n\r\nYour most obliged and affectionate sister,\r\n\r\nS. VERNON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY SUSAN VERNON TO MRS. JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\nLangford.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou were mistaken, my dear Alicia, in supposing me fixed at this place\r\nfor the rest of the winter: it grieves me to say how greatly you were\r\nmistaken, for I have seldom spent three months more agreeably than\r\nthose which have just flown away. At present, nothing goes smoothly; the\r\nfemales of the family are united against me. You foretold how it would\r\nbe when I first came to Langford, and Mainwaring is so uncommonly\r\npleasing that I was not without apprehensions for myself. I remember\r\nsaying to myself, as I drove to the house, \"I like this man, pray Heaven\r\nno harm come of it!\" But I was determined to be discreet, to bear in\r\nmind my being only four months a widow, and to be as quiet as possible:\r\nand I have been so, my dear creature; I have admitted no one's\r\nattentions but Mainwaring's. I have avoided all general flirtation\r\nwhatever; I have distinguished no creature besides, of all the numbers\r\nresorting hither, except Sir James Martin, on whom I bestowed a little\r\nnotice, in order to detach him from Miss Mainwaring; but, if the world\r\ncould know my motive THERE they would honour me. I have been called an\r\nunkind mother, but it was the sacred impulse of maternal affection, it\r\nwas the advantage of my daughter that led me on; and if that daughter\r\nwere not the greatest simpleton on earth, I might have been rewarded for\r\nmy exertions as I ought.\r\n\r\nSir James did make proposals to me for Frederica; but Frederica, who\r\nwas born to be the torment of my life, chose to set herself so violently\r\nagainst the match that I thought it better to lay aside the scheme for\r\nthe present. I have more than once repented that I did not marry him\r\nmyself; and were he but one degree less contemptibly weak I certainly\r\nshould: but I must own myself rather romantic in that respect, and\r\nthat riches only will not satisfy me. The event of all this is very\r\nprovoking: Sir James is gone, Maria highly incensed, and Mrs. Mainwaring\r\ninsupportably jealous; so jealous, in short, and so enraged against\r\nme, that, in the fury of her temper, I should not be surprized at her\r\nappealing to her guardian, if she had the liberty of addressing him:\r\nbut there your husband stands my friend; and the kindest, most amiable\r\naction of his life was his throwing her off for ever on her marriage.\r\nKeep up his resentment, therefore, I charge you. We are now in a sad\r\nstate; no house was ever more altered; the whole party are at war, and\r\nMainwaring scarcely dares speak to me. It is time for me to be gone; I\r\nhave therefore determined on leaving them, and shall spend, I hope, a\r\ncomfortable day with you in town within this week. If I am as little\r\nin favour with Mr. Johnson as ever, you must come to me at 10 Wigmore\r\nstreet; but I hope this may not be the case, for as Mr. Johnson, with\r\nall his faults, is a man to whom that great word \"respectable\" is always\r\ngiven, and I am known to be so intimate with his wife, his slighting me\r\nhas an awkward look.\r\n\r\nI take London in my way to that insupportable spot, a country village;\r\nfor I am really going to Churchhill. Forgive me, my dear friend, it is\r\nmy last resource. Were there another place in England open to me I would\r\nprefer it. Charles Vernon is my aversion; and I am afraid of his wife.\r\nAt Churchhill, however, I must remain till I have something better in\r\nview. My young lady accompanies me to town, where I shall deposit her\r\nunder the care of Miss Summers, in Wigmore street, till she becomes a\r\nlittle more reasonable. She will made good connections there, as the\r\ngirls are all of the best families. The price is immense, and much\r\nbeyond what I can ever attempt to pay.\r\n\r\nAdieu, I will send you a line as soon as I arrive in town.\r\n\r\nYours ever,\r\n\r\nS. VERNON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. VERNON TO LADY DE COURCY\r\n\r\n\r\nChurchhill.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Mother,--I am very sorry to tell you that it will not be in our\r\npower to keep our promise of spending our Christmas with you; and we are\r\nprevented that happiness by a circumstance which is not likely to\r\nmake us any amends. Lady Susan, in a letter to her brother-in-law, has\r\ndeclared her intention of visiting us almost immediately; and as such\r\na visit is in all probability merely an affair of convenience, it is\r\nimpossible to conjecture its length. I was by no means prepared for such\r\nan event, nor can I now account for her ladyship's conduct; Langford\r\nappeared so exactly the place for her in every respect, as well from\r\nthe elegant and expensive style of living there, as from her particular\r\nattachment to Mr. Mainwaring, that I was very far from expecting so\r\nspeedy a distinction, though I always imagined from her increasing\r\nfriendship for us since her husband's death that we should, at some\r\nfuture period, be obliged to receive her. Mr. Vernon, I think, was a\r\ngreat deal too kind to her when he was in Staffordshire; her behaviour\r\nto him, independent of her general character, has been so inexcusably\r\nartful and ungenerous since our marriage was first in agitation that no\r\none less amiable and mild than himself could have overlooked it all;\r\nand though, as his brother's widow, and in narrow circumstances, it was\r\nproper to render her pecuniary assistance, I cannot help thinking\r\nhis pressing invitation to her to visit us at Churchhill perfectly\r\nunnecessary. Disposed, however, as he always is to think the best of\r\neveryone, her display of grief, and professions of regret, and general\r\nresolutions of prudence, were sufficient to soften his heart and make\r\nhim really confide in her sincerity; but, as for myself, I am still\r\nunconvinced, and plausibly as her ladyship has now written, I cannot\r\nmake up my mind till I better understand her real meaning in coming to\r\nus. You may guess, therefore, my dear madam, with what feelings I look\r\nforward to her arrival. She will have occasion for all those attractive\r\npowers for which she is celebrated to gain any share of my regard; and\r\nI shall certainly endeavour to guard myself against their influence,\r\nif not accompanied by something more substantial. She expresses a\r\nmost eager desire of being acquainted with me, and makes very gracious\r\nmention of my children but I am not quite weak enough to suppose a woman\r\nwho has behaved with inattention, if not with unkindness, to her own\r\nchild, should be attached to any of mine. Miss Vernon is to be placed at\r\na school in London before her mother comes to us which I am glad of, for\r\nher sake and my own. It must be to her advantage to be separated from\r\nher mother, and a girl of sixteen who has received so wretched an\r\neducation, could not be a very desirable companion here. Reginald has\r\nlong wished, I know, to see the captivating Lady Susan, and we shall\r\ndepend on his joining our party soon. I am glad to hear that my father\r\ncontinues so well; and am, with best love, &c.,\r\n\r\nCATHERINE VERNON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. DE COURCY TO MRS. VERNON\r\n\r\n\r\nParklands.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Sister,--I congratulate you and Mr. Vernon on being about to\r\nreceive into your family the most accomplished coquette in England. As a\r\nvery distinguished flirt I have always been taught to consider her, but\r\nit has lately fallen in my way to hear some particulars of her conduct\r\nat Langford: which prove that she does not confine herself to that sort\r\nof honest flirtation which satisfies most people, but aspires to the\r\nmore delicious gratification of making a whole family miserable. By her\r\nbehaviour to Mr. Mainwaring she gave jealousy and wretchedness to his\r\nwife, and by her attentions to a young man previously attached to Mr.\r\nMainwaring's sister deprived an amiable girl of her lover.\r\n\r\nI learnt all this from Mr. Smith, now in this neighbourhood (I have\r\ndined with him, at Hurst and Wilford), who is just come from Langford\r\nwhere he was a fortnight with her ladyship, and who is therefore well\r\nqualified to make the communication.\r\n\r\nWhat a woman she must be! I long to see her, and shall certainly accept\r\nyour kind invitation, that I may form some idea of those bewitching\r\npowers which can do so much--engaging at the same time, and in the same\r\nhouse, the affections of two men, who were neither of them at liberty to\r\nbestow them--and all this without the charm of youth! I am glad to find\r\nMiss Vernon does not accompany her mother to Churchhill, as she has not\r\neven manners to recommend her; and, according to Mr. Smith's account, is\r\nequally dull and proud. Where pride and stupidity unite there can be\r\nno dissimulation worthy notice, and Miss Vernon shall be consigned to\r\nunrelenting contempt; but by all that I can gather Lady Susan possesses\r\na degree of captivating deceit which it must be pleasing to witness and\r\ndetect. I shall be with you very soon, and am ever,\r\n\r\nYour affectionate brother,\r\n\r\nR. DE COURCY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY SUSAN VERNON TO MRS. JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\nChurchhill.\r\n\r\n\r\nI received your note, my dear Alicia, just before I left town, and\r\nrejoice to be assured that Mr. Johnson suspected nothing of your\r\nengagement the evening before. It is undoubtedly better to deceive him\r\nentirely, and since he will be stubborn he must be tricked. I arrived\r\nhere in safety, and have no reason to complain of my reception from Mr.\r\nVernon; but I confess myself not equally satisfied with the behaviour of\r\nhis lady. She is perfectly well-bred, indeed, and has the air of a woman\r\nof fashion, but her manners are not such as can persuade me of her being\r\nprepossessed in my favour. I wanted her to be delighted at seeing me.\r\nI was as amiable as possible on the occasion, but all in vain. She does\r\nnot like me. To be sure when we consider that I DID take some pains to\r\nprevent my brother-in-law's marrying her, this want of cordiality is not\r\nvery surprizing, and yet it shows an illiberal and vindictive spirit\r\nto resent a project which influenced me six years ago, and which never\r\nsucceeded at last.\r\n\r\nI am sometimes disposed to repent that I did not let Charles buy\r\nVernon Castle, when we were obliged to sell it; but it was a trying\r\ncircumstance, especially as the sale took place exactly at the time\r\nof his marriage; and everybody ought to respect the delicacy of those\r\nfeelings which could not endure that my husband's dignity should be\r\nlessened by his younger brother's having possession of the family\r\nestate. Could matters have been so arranged as to prevent the necessity\r\nof our leaving the castle, could we have lived with Charles and kept\r\nhim single, I should have been very far from persuading my husband to\r\ndispose of it elsewhere; but Charles was on the point of marrying\r\nMiss De Courcy, and the event has justified me. Here are children in\r\nabundance, and what benefit could have accrued to me from his purchasing\r\nVernon? My having prevented it may perhaps have given his wife an\r\nunfavourable impression, but where there is a disposition to dislike,\r\na motive will never be wanting; and as to money matters it has not\r\nwithheld him from being very useful to me. I really have a regard\r\nfor him, he is so easily imposed upon! The house is a good one, the\r\nfurniture fashionable, and everything announces plenty and elegance.\r\nCharles is very rich I am sure; when a man has once got his name in a\r\nbanking-house he rolls in money; but they do not know what to do with\r\nit, keep very little company, and never go to London but on business. We\r\nshall be as stupid as possible. I mean to win my sister-in-law's heart\r\nthrough the children; I know all their names already, and am going to\r\nattach myself with the greatest sensibility to one in particular, a\r\nyoung Frederic, whom I take on my lap and sigh over for his dear uncle's\r\nsake.\r\n\r\nPoor Mainwaring! I need not tell you how much I miss him, how\r\nperpetually he is in my thoughts. I found a dismal letter from him on\r\nmy arrival here, full of complaints of his wife and sister, and\r\nlamentations on the cruelty of his fate. I passed off the letter as his\r\nwife's, to the Vernons, and when I write to him it must be under cover\r\nto you.\r\n\r\nEver yours, S. VERNON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. VERNON TO MR. DE COURCY\r\n\r\n\r\nChurchhill.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, my dear Reginald, I have seen this dangerous creature, and must\r\ngive you some description of her, though I hope you will soon be able to\r\nform your own judgment. She is really excessively pretty; however you may\r\nchoose to question the allurements of a lady no longer young, I must,\r\nfor my own part, declare that I have seldom seen so lovely a woman\r\nas Lady Susan. She is delicately fair, with fine grey eyes and dark\r\neyelashes; and from her appearance one would not suppose her more than\r\nfive and twenty, though she must in fact be ten years older, I was\r\ncertainly not disposed to admire her, though always hearing she was\r\nbeautiful; but I cannot help feeling that she possesses an uncommon\r\nunion of symmetry, brilliancy, and grace. Her address to me was so\r\ngentle, frank, and even affectionate, that, if I had not known how much\r\nshe has always disliked me for marrying Mr. Vernon, and that we had\r\nnever met before, I should have imagined her an attached friend. One\r\nis apt, I believe, to connect assurance of manner with coquetry, and to\r\nexpect that an impudent address will naturally attend an impudent mind;\r\nat least I was myself prepared for an improper degree of confidence in\r\nLady Susan; but her countenance is absolutely sweet, and her voice and\r\nmanner winningly mild. I am sorry it is so, for what is this but deceit?\r\nUnfortunately, one knows her too well. She is clever and agreeable, has\r\nall that knowledge of the world which makes conversation easy, and talks\r\nvery well, with a happy command of language, which is too often used, I\r\nbelieve, to make black appear white. She has already almost persuaded me\r\nof her being warmly attached to her daughter, though I have been so long\r\nconvinced to the contrary. She speaks of her with so much tenderness and\r\nanxiety, lamenting so bitterly the neglect of her education, which she\r\nrepresents however as wholly unavoidable, that I am forced to recollect\r\nhow many successive springs her ladyship spent in town, while her\r\ndaughter was left in Staffordshire to the care of servants, or a\r\ngoverness very little better, to prevent my believing what she says.\r\n\r\nIf her manners have so great an influence on my resentful heart, you\r\nmay judge how much more strongly they operate on Mr. Vernon's generous\r\ntemper. I wish I could be as well satisfied as he is, that it was really\r\nher choice to leave Langford for Churchhill; and if she had not stayed\r\nthere for months before she discovered that her friend's manner of\r\nliving did not suit her situation or feelings, I might have believed\r\nthat concern for the loss of such a husband as Mr. Vernon, to whom her\r\nown behaviour was far from unexceptionable, might for a time make her\r\nwish for retirement. But I cannot forget the length of her visit to the\r\nMainwarings, and when I reflect on the different mode of life which she\r\nled with them from that to which she must now submit, I can only suppose\r\nthat the wish of establishing her reputation by following though late\r\nthe path of propriety, occasioned her removal from a family where she\r\nmust in reality have been particularly happy. Your friend Mr. Smith's\r\nstory, however, cannot be quite correct, as she corresponds regularly\r\nwith Mrs. Mainwaring. At any rate it must be exaggerated. It is scarcely\r\npossible that two men should be so grossly deceived by her at once.\r\n\r\nYours, &c.,\r\n\r\nCATHERINE VERNON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY SUSAN VERNON TO MRS. JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\nChurchhill.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Alicia,--You are very good in taking notice of Frederica, and\r\nI am grateful for it as a mark of your friendship; but as I cannot have\r\nany doubt of the warmth of your affection, I am far from exacting so\r\nheavy a sacrifice. She is a stupid girl, and has nothing to recommend\r\nher. I would not, therefore, on my account, have you encumber one moment\r\nof your precious time by sending for her to Edward Street, especially\r\nas every visit is so much deducted from the grand affair of education,\r\nwhich I really wish to have attended to while she remains at Miss\r\nSummers's. I want her to play and sing with some portion of taste and\r\na good deal of assurance, as she has my hand and arm and a tolerable\r\nvoice. I was so much indulged in my infant years that I was never\r\nobliged to attend to anything, and consequently am without the\r\naccomplishments which are now necessary to finish a pretty woman. Not\r\nthat I am an advocate for the prevailing fashion of acquiring a perfect\r\nknowledge of all languages, arts, and sciences. It is throwing time\r\naway to be mistress of French, Italian, and German: music, singing,\r\nand drawing, &c., will gain a woman some applause, but will not add\r\none lover to her list--grace and manner, after all, are of the greatest\r\nimportance. I do not mean, therefore, that Frederica's acquirements\r\nshould be more than superficial, and I flatter myself that she will not\r\nremain long enough at school to understand anything thoroughly. I hope\r\nto see her the wife of Sir James within a twelvemonth. You know on what\r\nI ground my hope, and it is certainly a good foundation, for school must\r\nbe very humiliating to a girl of Frederica's age. And, by-the-by, you\r\nhad better not invite her any more on that account, as I wish her to\r\nfind her situation as unpleasant as possible. I am sure of Sir James at\r\nany time, and could make him renew his application by a line. I shall\r\ntrouble you meanwhile to prevent his forming any other attachment when\r\nhe comes to town. Ask him to your house occasionally, and talk to him of\r\nFrederica, that he may not forget her. Upon the whole, I commend my own\r\nconduct in this affair extremely, and regard it as a very happy instance\r\nof circumspection and tenderness. Some mothers would have insisted on\r\ntheir daughter's accepting so good an offer on the first overture; but I\r\ncould not reconcile it to myself to force Frederica into a marriage from\r\nwhich her heart revolted, and instead of adopting so harsh a measure\r\nmerely propose to make it her own choice, by rendering her thoroughly\r\nuncomfortable till she does accept him--but enough of this tiresome\r\ngirl. You may well wonder how I contrive to pass my time here, and for\r\nthe first week it was insufferably dull. Now, however, we begin to mend,\r\nour party is enlarged by Mrs. Vernon's brother, a handsome young man,\r\nwho promises me some amusement. There is something about him which\r\nrather interests me, a sort of sauciness and familiarity which I shall\r\nteach him to correct. He is lively, and seems clever, and when I have\r\ninspired him with greater respect for me than his sister's kind offices\r\nhave implanted, he may be an agreeable flirt. There is exquisite\r\npleasure in subduing an insolent spirit, in making a person\r\npredetermined to dislike acknowledge one's superiority. I have\r\ndisconcerted him already by my calm reserve, and it shall be my\r\nendeavour to humble the pride of these self important De Courcys still\r\nlower, to convince Mrs. Vernon that her sisterly cautions have been\r\nbestowed in vain, and to persuade Reginald that she has scandalously\r\nbelied me. This project will serve at least to amuse me, and prevent\r\nmy feeling so acutely this dreadful separation from you and all whom I\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nYours ever,\r\n\r\nS. VERNON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. VERNON TO LADY DE COURCY\r\n\r\n\r\nChurchhill.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Mother,--You must not expect Reginald back again for some time.\r\nHe desires me to tell you that the present open weather induces him to\r\naccept Mr. Vernon's invitation to prolong his stay in Sussex, that\r\nthey may have some hunting together. He means to send for his horses\r\nimmediately, and it is impossible to say when you may see him in Kent. I\r\nwill not disguise my sentiments on this change from you, my dear mother,\r\nthough I think you had better not communicate them to my father, whose\r\nexcessive anxiety about Reginald would subject him to an alarm which\r\nmight seriously affect his health and spirits. Lady Susan has certainly\r\ncontrived, in the space of a fortnight, to make my brother like her.\r\nIn short, I am persuaded that his continuing here beyond the time\r\noriginally fixed for his return is occasioned as much by a degree of\r\nfascination towards her, as by the wish of hunting with Mr. Vernon, and\r\nof course I cannot receive that pleasure from the length of his visit\r\nwhich my brother's company would otherwise give me. I am, indeed,\r\nprovoked at the artifice of this unprincipled woman; what stronger\r\nproof of her dangerous abilities can be given than this perversion of\r\nReginald's judgment, which when he entered the house was so decidedly\r\nagainst her! In his last letter he actually gave me some particulars of\r\nher behaviour at Langford, such as he received from a gentleman who knew\r\nher perfectly well, which, if true, must raise abhorrence against her,\r\nand which Reginald himself was entirely disposed to credit. His opinion\r\nof her, I am sure, was as low as of any woman in England; and when he\r\nfirst came it was evident that he considered her as one entitled neither\r\nto delicacy nor respect, and that he felt she would be delighted with\r\nthe attentions of any man inclined to flirt with her. Her behaviour, I\r\nconfess, has been calculated to do away with such an idea; I have\r\nnot detected the smallest impropriety in it--nothing of vanity, of\r\npretension, of levity; and she is altogether so attractive that I should\r\nnot wonder at his being delighted with her, had he known nothing of her\r\nprevious to this personal acquaintance; but, against reason, against\r\nconviction, to be so well pleased with her, as I am sure he is, does\r\nreally astonish me. His admiration was at first very strong, but no more\r\nthan was natural, and I did not wonder at his being much struck by the\r\ngentleness and delicacy of her manners; but when he has mentioned her of\r\nlate it has been in terms of more extraordinary praise; and yesterday he\r\nactually said that he could not be surprised at any effect produced\r\non the heart of man by such loveliness and such abilities; and when I\r\nlamented, in reply, the badness of her disposition, he observed that\r\nwhatever might have been her errors they were to be imputed to her\r\nneglected education and early marriage, and that she was altogether a\r\nwonderful woman. This tendency to excuse her conduct or to forget it, in\r\nthe warmth of admiration, vexes me; and if I did not know that Reginald\r\nis too much at home at Churchhill to need an invitation for lengthening\r\nhis visit, I should regret Mr. Vernon's giving him any. Lady Susan's\r\nintentions are of course those of absolute coquetry, or a desire\r\nof universal admiration; I cannot for a moment imagine that she has\r\nanything more serious in view; but it mortifies me to see a young man of\r\nReginald's sense duped by her at all.\r\n\r\nI am, &c.,\r\n\r\nCATHERINE VERNON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. JOHNSON TO LADY S. VERNON\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dearest Friend,--I congratulate you on Mr. De Courcy's arrival, and\r\nI advise you by all means to marry him; his father's estate is, we know,\r\nconsiderable, and I believe certainly entailed. Sir Reginald is very\r\ninfirm, and not likely to stand in your way long. I hear the young man\r\nwell spoken of; and though no one can really deserve you, my dearest\r\nSusan, Mr. De Courcy may be worth having. Mainwaring will storm of\r\ncourse, but you easily pacify him; besides, the most scrupulous point of\r\nhonour could not require you to wait for HIS emancipation. I have seen\r\nSir James; he came to town for a few days last week, and called several\r\ntimes in Edward Street. I talked to him about you and your daughter, and\r\nhe is so far from having forgotten you, that I am sure he would marry\r\neither of you with pleasure. I gave him hopes of Frederica's relenting,\r\nand told him a great deal of her improvements. I scolded him for making\r\nlove to Maria Mainwaring; he protested that he had been only in joke,\r\nand we both laughed heartily at her disappointment; and, in short, were\r\nvery agreeable. He is as silly as ever.\r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n\r\nALICIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY SUSAN VERNON TO MRS. JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\nChurchhill.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am much obliged to you, my dear Friend, for your advice respecting\r\nMr. De Courcy, which I know was given with the full conviction of its\r\nexpediency, though I am not quite determined on following it. I cannot\r\neasily resolve on anything so serious as marriage; especially as I\r\nam not at present in want of money, and might perhaps, till the old\r\ngentleman's death, be very little benefited by the match. It is true\r\nthat I am vain enough to believe it within my reach. I have made him\r\nsensible of my power, and can now enjoy the pleasure of triumphing\r\nover a mind prepared to dislike me, and prejudiced against all my\r\npast actions. His sister, too, is, I hope, convinced how little the\r\nungenerous representations of anyone to the disadvantage of another will\r\navail when opposed by the immediate influence of intellect and manner. I\r\nsee plainly that she is uneasy at my progress in the good opinion of\r\nher brother, and conclude that nothing will be wanting on her part to\r\ncounteract me; but having once made him doubt the justice of her opinion\r\nof me, I think I may defy her. It has been delightful to me to watch\r\nhis advances towards intimacy, especially to observe his altered manner\r\nin consequence of my repressing by the cool dignity of my deportment\r\nhis insolent approach to direct familiarity. My conduct has been equally\r\nguarded from the first, and I never behaved less like a coquette in the\r\nwhole course of my life, though perhaps my desire of dominion was never\r\nmore decided. I have subdued him entirely by sentiment and serious\r\nconversation, and made him, I may venture to say, at least half in love\r\nwith me, without the semblance of the most commonplace flirtation. Mrs.\r\nVernon's consciousness of deserving every sort of revenge that it can\r\nbe in my power to inflict for her ill-offices could alone enable her\r\nto perceive that I am actuated by any design in behaviour so gentle\r\nand unpretending. Let her think and act as she chooses, however. I have\r\nnever yet found that the advice of a sister could prevent a young\r\nman's being in love if he chose. We are advancing now to some kind of\r\nconfidence, and in short are likely to be engaged in a sort of platonic\r\nfriendship. On my side you may be sure of its never being more, for if\r\nI were not attached to another person as much as I can be to anyone, I\r\nshould make a point of not bestowing my affection on a man who had dared\r\nto think so meanly of me. Reginald has a good figure and is not unworthy\r\nthe praise you have heard given him, but is still greatly inferior\r\nto our friend at Langford. He is less polished, less insinuating than\r\nMainwaring, and is comparatively deficient in the power of saying those\r\ndelightful things which put one in good humour with oneself and all the\r\nworld. He is quite agreeable enough, however, to afford me amusement,\r\nand to make many of those hours pass very pleasantly which would\r\notherwise be spent in endeavouring to overcome my sister-in-law's\r\nreserve, and listening to the insipid talk of her husband. Your account\r\nof Sir James is most satisfactory, and I mean to give Miss Frederica a\r\nhint of my intentions very soon.\r\n\r\nYours, &c.,\r\n\r\nS. VERNON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. VERNON TO LADY DE COURCY\r\n\r\n\r\nChurchhill\r\n\r\n\r\nI really grow quite uneasy, my dearest mother, about Reginald, from\r\nwitnessing the very rapid increase of Lady Susan's influence. They are\r\nnow on terms of the most particular friendship, frequently engaged in\r\nlong conversations together; and she has contrived by the most artful\r\ncoquetry to subdue his judgment to her own purposes. It is impossible\r\nto see the intimacy between them so very soon established without some\r\nalarm, though I can hardly suppose that Lady Susan's plans extend to\r\nmarriage. I wish you could get Reginald home again on any plausible\r\npretence; he is not at all disposed to leave us, and I have given him as\r\nmany hints of my father's precarious state of health as common decency\r\nwill allow me to do in my own house. Her power over him must now be\r\nboundless, as she has entirely effaced all his former ill-opinion,\r\nand persuaded him not merely to forget but to justify her conduct. Mr.\r\nSmith's account of her proceedings at Langford, where he accused her of\r\nhaving made Mr. Mainwaring and a young man engaged to Miss Mainwaring\r\ndistractedly in love with her, which Reginald firmly believed when he\r\ncame here, is now, he is persuaded, only a scandalous invention. He\r\nhas told me so with a warmth of manner which spoke his regret at having\r\nbelieved the contrary himself. How sincerely do I grieve that she\r\never entered this house! I always looked forward to her coming with\r\nuneasiness; but very far was it from originating in anxiety for\r\nReginald. I expected a most disagreeable companion for myself, but could\r\nnot imagine that my brother would be in the smallest danger of being\r\ncaptivated by a woman with whose principles he was so well acquainted,\r\nand whose character he so heartily despised. If you can get him away it\r\nwill be a good thing.\r\n\r\nYours, &c.,\r\n\r\nCATHERINE VERNON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR REGINALD DE COURCY TO HIS SON\r\n\r\n\r\nParklands.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know that young men in general do not admit of any enquiry even from\r\ntheir nearest relations into affairs of the heart, but I hope, my dear\r\nReginald, that you will be superior to such as allow nothing for a\r\nfather's anxiety, and think themselves privileged to refuse him their\r\nconfidence and slight his advice. You must be sensible that as an only\r\nson, and the representative of an ancient family, your conduct in life\r\nis most interesting to your connections; and in the very important\r\nconcern of marriage especially, there is everything at stake--your own\r\nhappiness, that of your parents, and the credit of your name. I do not\r\nsuppose that you would deliberately form an absolute engagement of that\r\nnature without acquainting your mother and myself, or at least, without\r\nbeing convinced that we should approve of your choice; but I cannot help\r\nfearing that you may be drawn in, by the lady who has lately attached\r\nyou, to a marriage which the whole of your family, far and near, must\r\nhighly reprobate. Lady Susan's age is itself a material objection, but\r\nher want of character is one so much more serious, that the difference\r\nof even twelve years becomes in comparison of small amount. Were you not\r\nblinded by a sort of fascination, it would be ridiculous in me to repeat\r\nthe instances of great misconduct on her side so very generally known.\r\n\r\nHer neglect of her husband, her encouragement of other men, her\r\nextravagance and dissipation, were so gross and notorious that no one\r\ncould be ignorant of them at the time, nor can now have forgotten them.\r\nTo our family she has always been represented in softened colours by\r\nthe benevolence of Mr. Charles Vernon, and yet, in spite of his generous\r\nendeavours to excuse her, we know that she did, from the most selfish\r\nmotives, take all possible pains to prevent his marriage with Catherine.\r\n\r\nMy years and increasing infirmities make me very desirous of seeing you\r\nsettled in the world. To the fortune of a wife, the goodness of my own\r\nwill make me indifferent, but her family and character must be equally\r\nunexceptionable. When your choice is fixed so that no objection can be\r\nmade to it, then I can promise you a ready and cheerful consent; but it\r\nis my duty to oppose a match which deep art only could render possible,\r\nand must in the end make wretched. It is possible her behaviour may\r\narise only from vanity, or the wish of gaining the admiration of a man\r\nwhom she must imagine to be particularly prejudiced against her; but it\r\nis more likely that she should aim at something further. She is poor,\r\nand may naturally seek an alliance which must be advantageous to\r\nherself; you know your own rights, and that it is out of my power to\r\nprevent your inheriting the family estate. My ability of distressing\r\nyou during my life would be a species of revenge to which I could hardly\r\nstoop under any circumstances.\r\n\r\nI honestly tell you my sentiments and intentions: I do not wish to work\r\non your fears, but on your sense and affection. It would destroy every\r\ncomfort of my life to know that you were married to Lady Susan Vernon;\r\nit would be the death of that honest pride with which I have hitherto\r\nconsidered my son; I should blush to see him, to hear of him, to think\r\nof him. I may perhaps do no good but that of relieving my own mind by\r\nthis letter, but I felt it my duty to tell you that your partiality for\r\nLady Susan is no secret to your friends, and to warn you against her.\r\nI should be glad to hear your reasons for disbelieving Mr. Smith's\r\nintelligence; you had no doubt of its authenticity a month ago. If\r\nyou can give me your assurance of having no design beyond enjoying\r\nthe conversation of a clever woman for a short period, and of yielding\r\nadmiration only to her beauty and abilities, without being blinded by\r\nthem to her faults, you will restore me to happiness; but, if you cannot\r\ndo this, explain to me, at least, what has occasioned so great an\r\nalteration in your opinion of her.\r\n\r\nI am, &c., &c,\r\n\r\nREGINALD DE COURCY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY DE COURCY TO MRS. VERNON\r\n\r\n\r\nParklands.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Catherine,--Unluckily I was confined to my room when your last\r\nletter came, by a cold which affected my eyes so much as to prevent my\r\nreading it myself, so I could not refuse your father when he offered\r\nto read it to me, by which means he became acquainted, to my great\r\nvexation, with all your fears about your brother. I had intended to\r\nwrite to Reginald myself as soon as my eyes would let me, to point out,\r\nas well as I could, the danger of an intimate acquaintance, with so\r\nartful a woman as Lady Susan, to a young man of his age, and high\r\nexpectations. I meant, moreover, to have reminded him of our being quite\r\nalone now, and very much in need of him to keep up our spirits these\r\nlong winter evenings. Whether it would have done any good can never be\r\nsettled now, but I am excessively vexed that Sir Reginald should know\r\nanything of a matter which we foresaw would make him so uneasy. He\r\ncaught all your fears the moment he had read your letter, and I am sure\r\nhe has not had the business out of his head since. He wrote by the same\r\npost to Reginald a long letter full of it all, and particularly asking\r\nan explanation of what he may have heard from Lady Susan to contradict\r\nthe late shocking reports. His answer came this morning, which I shall\r\nenclose to you, as I think you will like to see it. I wish it was more\r\nsatisfactory; but it seems written with such a determination to think\r\nwell of Lady Susan, that his assurances as to marriage, &c., do not set\r\nmy heart at ease. I say all I can, however, to satisfy your father, and\r\nhe is certainly less uneasy since Reginald's letter. How provoking it\r\nis, my dear Catherine, that this unwelcome guest of yours should not\r\nonly prevent our meeting this Christmas, but be the occasion of so much\r\nvexation and trouble! Kiss the dear children for me.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate mother,\r\n\r\nC. DE COURCY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. DE COURCY TO SIR REGINALD\r\n\r\n\r\nChurchhill.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,--I have this moment received your letter, which has given\r\nme more astonishment than I ever felt before. I am to thank my sister,\r\nI suppose, for having represented me in such a light as to injure me\r\nin your opinion, and give you all this alarm. I know not why she should\r\nchoose to make herself and her family uneasy by apprehending an\r\nevent which no one but herself, I can affirm, would ever have thought\r\npossible. To impute such a design to Lady Susan would be taking from her\r\nevery claim to that excellent understanding which her bitterest enemies\r\nhave never denied her; and equally low must sink my pretensions to\r\ncommon sense if I am suspected of matrimonial views in my behaviour\r\nto her. Our difference of age must be an insuperable objection, and I\r\nentreat you, my dear father, to quiet your mind, and no longer harbour\r\na suspicion which cannot be more injurious to your own peace than to our\r\nunderstandings. I can have no other view in remaining with Lady Susan,\r\nthan to enjoy for a short time (as you have yourself expressed it) the\r\nconversation of a woman of high intellectual powers. If Mrs. Vernon\r\nwould allow something to my affection for herself and her husband in the\r\nlength of my visit, she would do more justice to us all; but my sister\r\nis unhappily prejudiced beyond the hope of conviction against Lady\r\nSusan. From an attachment to her husband, which in itself does honour to\r\nboth, she cannot forgive the endeavours at preventing their union, which\r\nhave been attributed to selfishness in Lady Susan; but in this case, as\r\nwell as in many others, the world has most grossly injured that lady, by\r\nsupposing the worst where the motives of her conduct have been doubtful.\r\nLady Susan had heard something so materially to the disadvantage of my\r\nsister as to persuade her that the happiness of Mr. Vernon, to whom she\r\nwas always much attached, would be wholly destroyed by the marriage. And\r\nthis circumstance, while it explains the true motives of Lady Susan's\r\nconduct, and removes all the blame which has been so lavished on her,\r\nmay also convince us how little the general report of anyone ought to\r\nbe credited; since no character, however upright, can escape the\r\nmalevolence of slander. If my sister, in the security of retirement,\r\nwith as little opportunity as inclination to do evil, could not avoid\r\ncensure, we must not rashly condemn those who, living in the world and\r\nsurrounded with temptations, should be accused of errors which they are\r\nknown to have the power of committing.\r\n\r\nI blame myself severely for having so easily believed the slanderous\r\ntales invented by Charles Smith to the prejudice of Lady Susan, as I\r\nam now convinced how greatly they have traduced her. As to Mrs.\r\nMainwaring's jealousy it was totally his own invention, and his account\r\nof her attaching Miss Mainwaring's lover was scarcely better founded.\r\nSir James Martin had been drawn in by that young lady to pay her some\r\nattention; and as he is a man of fortune, it was easy to see HER views\r\nextended to marriage. It is well known that Miss M. is absolutely on the\r\ncatch for a husband, and no one therefore can pity her for losing, by\r\nthe superior attractions of another woman, the chance of being able to\r\nmake a worthy man completely wretched. Lady Susan was far from intending\r\nsuch a conquest, and on finding how warmly Miss Mainwaring resented her\r\nlover's defection, determined, in spite of Mr. and Mrs. Mainwaring's\r\nmost urgent entreaties, to leave the family. I have reason to imagine\r\nshe did receive serious proposals from Sir James, but her removing to\r\nLangford immediately on the discovery of his attachment, must acquit her\r\non that article with any mind of common candour. You will, I am sure, my\r\ndear Sir, feel the truth of this, and will hereby learn to do justice to\r\nthe character of a very injured woman. I know that Lady Susan in coming\r\nto Churchhill was governed only by the most honourable and amiable\r\nintentions; her prudence and economy are exemplary, her regard for Mr.\r\nVernon equal even to HIS deserts; and her wish of obtaining my sister's\r\ngood opinion merits a better return than it has received. As a mother\r\nshe is unexceptionable; her solid affection for her child is shown by\r\nplacing her in hands where her education will be properly attended to;\r\nbut because she has not the blind and weak partiality of most mothers,\r\nshe is accused of wanting maternal tenderness. Every person of sense,\r\nhowever, will know how to value and commend her well-directed affection,\r\nand will join me in wishing that Frederica Vernon may prove more worthy\r\nthan she has yet done of her mother's tender care. I have now, my dear\r\nfather, written my real sentiments of Lady Susan; you will know from\r\nthis letter how highly I admire her abilities, and esteem her character;\r\nbut if you are not equally convinced by my full and solemn assurance\r\nthat your fears have been most idly created, you will deeply mortify and\r\ndistress me.\r\n\r\nI am, &c., &c.,\r\n\r\nR. DE COURCY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. VERNON TO LADY DE COURCY\r\n\r\n\r\nChurchhill\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Mother,--I return you Reginald's letter, and rejoice with all\r\nmy heart that my father is made easy by it: tell him so, with my\r\ncongratulations; but, between ourselves, I must own it has only\r\nconvinced ME of my brother's having no PRESENT intention of marrying\r\nLady Susan, not that he is in no danger of doing so three months hence.\r\nHe gives a very plausible account of her behaviour at Langford; I wish\r\nit may be true, but his intelligence must come from herself, and I\r\nam less disposed to believe it than to lament the degree of intimacy\r\nsubsisting between them, implied by the discussion of such a subject. I\r\nam sorry to have incurred his displeasure, but can expect nothing better\r\nwhile he is so very eager in Lady Susan's justification. He is very\r\nsevere against me indeed, and yet I hope I have not been hasty in\r\nmy judgment of her. Poor woman! though I have reasons enough for\r\nmy dislike, I cannot help pitying her at present, as she is in real\r\ndistress, and with too much cause. She had this morning a letter from\r\nthe lady with whom she has placed her daughter, to request that Miss\r\nVernon might be immediately removed, as she had been detected in an\r\nattempt to run away. Why, or whither she intended to go, does not\r\nappear; but, as her situation seems to have been unexceptionable, it is\r\na sad thing, and of course highly distressing to Lady Susan. Frederica\r\nmust be as much as sixteen, and ought to know better; but from what\r\nher mother insinuates, I am afraid she is a perverse girl. She has\r\nbeen sadly neglected, however, and her mother ought to remember it. Mr.\r\nVernon set off for London as soon as she had determined what should be\r\ndone. He is, if possible, to prevail on Miss Summers to let Frederica\r\ncontinue with her; and if he cannot succeed, to bring her to Churchhill\r\nfor the present, till some other situation can be found for her.\r\nHer ladyship is comforting herself meanwhile by strolling along the\r\nshrubbery with Reginald, calling forth all his tender feelings, I\r\nsuppose, on this distressing occasion. She has been talking a great deal\r\nabout it to me. She talks vastly well; I am afraid of being ungenerous,\r\nor I should say, TOO well to feel so very deeply; but I will not look\r\nfor her faults; she may be Reginald's wife! Heaven forbid it! but why\r\nshould I be quicker-sighted than anyone else? Mr. Vernon declares that\r\nhe never saw deeper distress than hers, on the receipt of the letter;\r\nand is his judgment inferior to mine? She was very unwilling that\r\nFrederica should be allowed to come to Churchhill, and justly enough, as\r\nit seems a sort of reward to behaviour deserving very differently; but\r\nit was impossible to take her anywhere else, and she is not to remain\r\nhere long. \"It will be absolutely necessary,\" said she, \"as you, my dear\r\nsister, must be sensible, to treat my daughter with some severity while\r\nshe is here; a most painful necessity, but I will ENDEAVOUR to submit to\r\nit. I am afraid I have often been too indulgent, but my poor Frederica's\r\ntemper could never bear opposition well: you must support and encourage\r\nme; you must urge the necessity of reproof if you see me too lenient.\"\r\nAll this sounds very reasonable. Reginald is so incensed against the\r\npoor silly girl. Surely it is not to Lady Susan's credit that he should\r\nbe so bitter against her daughter; his idea of her must be drawn from\r\nthe mother's description. Well, whatever may be his fate, we have the\r\ncomfort of knowing that we have done our utmost to save him. We must\r\ncommit the event to a higher power.\r\n\r\nYours ever, &c.,\r\n\r\nCATHERINE VERNON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY SUSAN TO MRS. JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\nChurchhill.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever, my dearest Alicia, was I so provoked in my life as by a letter\r\nthis morning from Miss Summers. That horrid girl of mine has been trying\r\nto run away. I had not a notion of her being such a little devil before,\r\nshe seemed to have all the Vernon milkiness; but on receiving the letter\r\nin which I declared my intention about Sir James, she actually attempted\r\nto elope; at least, I cannot otherwise account for her doing it. She\r\nmeant, I suppose, to go to the Clarkes in Staffordshire, for she has no\r\nother acquaintances. But she shall be punished, she shall have him. I\r\nhave sent Charles to town to make matters up if he can, for I do not\r\nby any means want her here. If Miss Summers will not keep her, you must\r\nfind me out another school, unless we can get her married immediately.\r\nMiss S. writes word that she could not get the young lady to assign\r\nany cause for her extraordinary conduct, which confirms me in my own\r\nprevious explanation of it. Frederica is too shy, I think, and too much\r\nin awe of me to tell tales, but if the mildness of her uncle should get\r\nanything out of her, I am not afraid. I trust I shall be able to make my\r\nstory as good as hers. If I am vain of anything, it is of my eloquence.\r\nConsideration and esteem as surely follow command of language as\r\nadmiration waits on beauty, and here I have opportunity enough for the\r\nexercise of my talent, as the chief of my time is spent in conversation.\r\n\r\nReginald is never easy unless we are by ourselves, and when the weather\r\nis tolerable, we pace the shrubbery for hours together. I like him on\r\nthe whole very well; he is clever and has a good deal to say, but he\r\nis sometimes impertinent and troublesome. There is a sort of ridiculous\r\ndelicacy about him which requires the fullest explanation of whatever he\r\nmay have heard to my disadvantage, and is never satisfied till he thinks\r\nhe has ascertained the beginning and end of everything. This is one sort\r\nof love, but I confess it does not particularly recommend itself to me.\r\nI infinitely prefer the tender and liberal spirit of Mainwaring, which,\r\nimpressed with the deepest conviction of my merit, is satisfied that\r\nwhatever I do must be right; and look with a degree of contempt on\r\nthe inquisitive and doubtful fancies of that heart which seems always\r\ndebating on the reasonableness of its emotions. Mainwaring is indeed,\r\nbeyond all compare, superior to Reginald--superior in everything but the\r\npower of being with me! Poor fellow! he is much distracted by jealousy,\r\nwhich I am not sorry for, as I know no better support of love. He has\r\nbeen teazing me to allow of his coming into this country, and lodging\r\nsomewhere near INCOG.; but I forbade everything of the kind. Those women\r\nare inexcusable who forget what is due to themselves, and the opinion of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nYours ever, S. VERNON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. VERNON TO LADY DE COURCY\r\n\r\n\r\nChurchhill.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Mother,--Mr. Vernon returned on Thursday night, bringing his\r\nniece with him. Lady Susan had received a line from him by that day's\r\npost, informing her that Miss Summers had absolutely refused to allow of\r\nMiss Vernon's continuance in her academy; we were therefore prepared for\r\nher arrival, and expected them impatiently the whole evening. They came\r\nwhile we were at tea, and I never saw any creature look so frightened as\r\nFrederica when she entered the room. Lady Susan, who had been shedding\r\ntears before, and showing great agitation at the idea of the meeting,\r\nreceived her with perfect self-command, and without betraying the\r\nleast tenderness of spirit. She hardly spoke to her, and on Frederica's\r\nbursting into tears as soon as we were seated, took her out of the room,\r\nand did not return for some time. When she did, her eyes looked very red\r\nand she was as much agitated as before. We saw no more of her daughter.\r\nPoor Reginald was beyond measure concerned to see his fair friend in\r\nsuch distress, and watched her with so much tender solicitude, that I,\r\nwho occasionally caught her observing his countenance with exultation,\r\nwas quite out of patience. This pathetic representation lasted the whole\r\nevening, and so ostentatious and artful a display has entirely convinced\r\nme that she did in fact feel nothing. I am more angry with her than ever\r\nsince I have seen her daughter; the poor girl looks so unhappy that my\r\nheart aches for her. Lady Susan is surely too severe, for Frederica\r\ndoes not seem to have the sort of temper to make severity necessary.\r\nShe looks perfectly timid, dejected, and penitent. She is very\r\npretty, though not so handsome as her mother, nor at all like her. Her\r\ncomplexion is delicate, but neither so fair nor so blooming as Lady\r\nSusan's, and she has quite the Vernon cast of countenance, the oval face\r\nand mild dark eyes, and there is peculiar sweetness in her look when she\r\nspeaks either to her uncle or me, for as we behave kindly to her we have\r\nof course engaged her gratitude.\r\n\r\nHer mother has insinuated that her temper is intractable, but I never\r\nsaw a face less indicative of any evil disposition than hers; and from\r\nwhat I can see of the behaviour of each to the other, the invariable\r\nseverity of Lady Susan and the silent dejection of Frederica, I am\r\nled to believe as heretofore that the former has no real love for her\r\ndaughter, and has never done her justice or treated her affectionately.\r\nI have not been able to have any conversation with my niece; she is shy,\r\nand I think I can see that some pains are taken to prevent her being\r\nmuch with me. Nothing satisfactory transpires as to her reason for\r\nrunning away. Her kind-hearted uncle, you may be sure, was too fearful\r\nof distressing her to ask many questions as they travelled. I wish it\r\nhad been possible for me to fetch her instead of him. I think I should\r\nhave discovered the truth in the course of a thirty-mile journey. The\r\nsmall pianoforte has been removed within these few days, at Lady Susan's\r\nrequest, into her dressing-room, and Frederica spends great part of the\r\nday there, practising as it is called; but I seldom hear any noise when\r\nI pass that way; what she does with herself there I do not know. There\r\nare plenty of books, but it is not every girl who has been running\r\nwild the first fifteen years of her life, that can or will read. Poor\r\ncreature! the prospect from her window is not very instructive, for that\r\nroom overlooks the lawn, you know, with the shrubbery on one side,\r\nwhere she may see her mother walking for an hour together in earnest\r\nconversation with Reginald. A girl of Frederica's age must be childish\r\nindeed, if such things do not strike her. Is it not inexcusable to give\r\nsuch an example to a daughter? Yet Reginald still thinks Lady Susan the\r\nbest of mothers, and still condemns Frederica as a worthless girl! He\r\nis convinced that her attempt to run away proceeded from no, justifiable\r\ncause, and had no provocation. I am sure I cannot say that it HAD,\r\nbut while Miss Summers declares that Miss Vernon showed no signs of\r\nobstinacy or perverseness during her whole stay in Wigmore Street, till\r\nshe was detected in this scheme, I cannot so readily credit what Lady\r\nSusan has made him, and wants to make me believe, that it was merely\r\nan impatience of restraint and a desire of escaping from the tuition of\r\nmasters which brought on the plan of an elopement. O Reginald, how is\r\nyour judgment enslaved! He scarcely dares even allow her to be handsome,\r\nand when I speak of her beauty, replies only that her eyes have no\r\nbrilliancy! Sometimes he is sure she is deficient in understanding, and\r\nat others that her temper only is in fault. In short, when a person is\r\nalways to deceive, it is impossible to be consistent. Lady Susan\r\nfinds it necessary that Frederica should be to blame, and probably has\r\nsometimes judged it expedient to excuse her of ill-nature and sometimes\r\nto lament her want of sense. Reginald is only repeating after her\r\nladyship.\r\n\r\nI remain, &c., &c.,\r\n\r\nCATHERINE VERNON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE SAME TO THE SAME\r\n\r\n\r\nChurchhill.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Mother,--I am very glad to find that my description of Frederica\r\nVernon has interested you, for I do believe her truly deserving of your\r\nregard; and when I have communicated a notion which has recently struck\r\nme, your kind impressions in her favour will, I am sure, be heightened.\r\nI cannot help fancying that she is growing partial to my brother. I so\r\nvery often see her eyes fixed on his face with a remarkable expression\r\nof pensive admiration. He is certainly very handsome; and yet more,\r\nthere is an openness in his manner that must be highly prepossessing,\r\nand I am sure she feels it so. Thoughtful and pensive in general, her\r\ncountenance always brightens into a smile when Reginald says anything\r\namusing; and, let the subject be ever so serious that he may be\r\nconversing on, I am much mistaken if a syllable of his uttering escapes\r\nher. I want to make him sensible of all this, for we know the power\r\nof gratitude on such a heart as his; and could Frederica's artless\r\naffection detach him from her mother, we might bless the day which\r\nbrought her to Churchhill. I think, my dear mother, you would not\r\ndisapprove of her as a daughter. She is extremely young, to be sure,\r\nhas had a wretched education, and a dreadful example of levity in her\r\nmother; but yet I can pronounce her disposition to be excellent, and her\r\nnatural abilities very good. Though totally without accomplishments, she\r\nis by no means so ignorant as one might expect to find her, being fond\r\nof books and spending the chief of her time in reading. Her mother\r\nleaves her more to herself than she did, and I have her with me as much\r\nas possible, and have taken great pains to overcome her timidity. We\r\nare very good friends, and though she never opens her lips before her\r\nmother, she talks enough when alone with me to make it clear that, if\r\nproperly treated by Lady Susan, she would always appear to much greater\r\nadvantage. There cannot be a more gentle, affectionate heart; or more\r\nobliging manners, when acting without restraint; and her little cousins\r\nare all very fond of her.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate daughter,\r\n\r\nC. VERNON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY SUSAN TO MRS. JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\nChurchhill.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will be eager, I know, to hear something further of Frederica, and\r\nperhaps may think me negligent for not writing before. She arrived with\r\nher uncle last Thursday fortnight, when, of course, I lost no time in\r\ndemanding the cause of her behaviour; and soon found myself to have been\r\nperfectly right in attributing it to my own letter. The prospect of\r\nit frightened her so thoroughly, that, with a mixture of true girlish\r\nperverseness and folly, she resolved on getting out of the house and\r\nproceeding directly by the stage to her friends, the Clarkes; and had\r\nreally got as far as the length of two streets in her journey when\r\nshe was fortunately missed, pursued, and overtaken. Such was the first\r\ndistinguished exploit of Miss Frederica Vernon; and, if we consider that\r\nit was achieved at the tender age of sixteen, we shall have room for\r\nthe most flattering prognostics of her future renown. I am excessively\r\nprovoked, however, at the parade of propriety which prevented Miss\r\nSummers from keeping the girl; and it seems so extraordinary a piece of\r\nnicety, considering my daughter's family connections, that I can only\r\nsuppose the lady to be governed by the fear of never getting her money.\r\nBe that as it may, however, Frederica is returned on my hands; and,\r\nhaving nothing else to employ her, is busy in pursuing the plan of\r\nromance begun at Langford. She is actually falling in love with Reginald\r\nDe Courcy! To disobey her mother by refusing an unexceptionable offer\r\nis not enough; her affections must also be given without her mother's\r\napprobation. I never saw a girl of her age bid fairer to be the sport\r\nof mankind. Her feelings are tolerably acute, and she is so charmingly\r\nartless in their display as to afford the most reasonable hope of her\r\nbeing ridiculous, and despised by every man who sees her.\r\n\r\nArtlessness will never do in love matters; and that girl is born a\r\nsimpleton who has it either by nature or affectation. I am not yet\r\ncertain that Reginald sees what she is about, nor is it of much\r\nconsequence. She is now an object of indifference to him, and she would\r\nbe one of contempt were he to understand her emotions. Her beauty is\r\nmuch admired by the Vernons, but it has no effect on him. She is in high\r\nfavour with her aunt altogether, because she is so little like myself,\r\nof course. She is exactly the companion for Mrs. Vernon, who dearly\r\nloves to be firm, and to have all the sense and all the wit of the\r\nconversation to herself: Frederica will never eclipse her. When she\r\nfirst came I was at some pains to prevent her seeing much of her aunt;\r\nbut I have relaxed, as I believe I may depend on her observing the rules\r\nI have laid down for their discourse. But do not imagine that with all\r\nthis lenity I have for a moment given up my plan of her marriage. No; I\r\nam unalterably fixed on this point, though I have not yet quite decided\r\non the manner of bringing it about. I should not chuse to have the\r\nbusiness brought on here, and canvassed by the wise heads of Mr. and\r\nMrs. Vernon; and I cannot just now afford to go to town. Miss Frederica\r\nmust therefore wait a little.\r\n\r\nYours ever,\r\n\r\nS. VERNON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. VERNON TO LADY DE COURCY\r\n\r\n\r\nChurchhill\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have a very unexpected guest with us at present, my dear Mother: he\r\narrived yesterday. I heard a carriage at the door, as I was sitting with\r\nmy children while they dined; and supposing I should be wanted, left the\r\nnursery soon afterwards, and was half-way downstairs, when Frederica,\r\nas pale as ashes, came running up, and rushed by me into her own room.\r\nI instantly followed, and asked her what was the matter. \"Oh!\" said\r\nshe, \"he is come--Sir James is come, and what shall I do?\" This was no\r\nexplanation; I begged her to tell me what she meant. At that moment we\r\nwere interrupted by a knock at the door: it was Reginald, who came, by\r\nLady Susan's direction, to call Frederica down. \"It is Mr. De Courcy!\"\r\nsaid she, colouring violently. \"Mamma has sent for me; I must go.\"\r\nWe all three went down together; and I saw my brother examining the\r\nterrified face of Frederica with surprize. In the breakfast-room we\r\nfound Lady Susan, and a young man of gentlemanlike appearance, whom she\r\nintroduced by the name of Sir James Martin--the very person, as you may\r\nremember, whom it was said she had been at pains to detach from Miss\r\nMainwaring; but the conquest, it seems, was not designed for herself,\r\nor she has since transferred it to her daughter; for Sir James is now\r\ndesperately in love with Frederica, and with full encouragement from\r\nmamma. The poor girl, however, I am sure, dislikes him; and though his\r\nperson and address are very well, he appears, both to Mr. Vernon and\r\nme, a very weak young man. Frederica looked so shy, so confused, when\r\nwe entered the room, that I felt for her exceedingly. Lady Susan behaved\r\nwith great attention to her visitor; and yet I thought I could perceive\r\nthat she had no particular pleasure in seeing him. Sir James talked a\r\ngreat deal, and made many civil excuses to me for the liberty he had\r\ntaken in coming to Churchhill--mixing more frequent laughter with his\r\ndiscourse than the subject required--said many things over and over\r\nagain, and told Lady Susan three times that he had seen Mrs. Johnson\r\na few evenings before. He now and then addressed Frederica, but more\r\nfrequently her mother. The poor girl sat all this time without opening\r\nher lips--her eyes cast down, and her colour varying every instant;\r\nwhile Reginald observed all that passed in perfect silence. At length\r\nLady Susan, weary, I believe, of her situation, proposed walking; and\r\nwe left the two gentlemen together, to put on our pelisses. As we went\r\nupstairs Lady Susan begged permission to attend me for a few moments in\r\nmy dressing-room, as she was anxious to speak with me in private. I led\r\nher thither accordingly, and as soon as the door was closed, she said:\r\n\"I was never more surprized in my life than by Sir James's arrival,\r\nand the suddenness of it requires some apology to you, my dear sister;\r\nthough to ME, as a mother, it is highly flattering. He is so extremely\r\nattached to my daughter that he could not exist longer without seeing\r\nher. Sir James is a young man of an amiable disposition and excellent\r\ncharacter; a little too much of the rattle, perhaps, but a year or two\r\nwill rectify THAT: and he is in other respects so very eligible a match\r\nfor Frederica, that I have always observed his attachment with the\r\ngreatest pleasure; and am persuaded that you and my brother will give\r\nthe alliance your hearty approbation. I have never before mentioned the\r\nlikelihood of its taking place to anyone, because I thought that whilst\r\nFrederica continued at school it had better not be known to exist;\r\nbut now, as I am convinced that Frederica is too old ever to submit to\r\nschool confinement, and have, therefore, begun to consider her union\r\nwith Sir James as not very distant, I had intended within a few days to\r\nacquaint yourself and Mr. Vernon with the whole business. I am sure, my\r\ndear sister, you will excuse my remaining silent so long, and agree\r\nwith me that such circumstances, while they continue from any cause\r\nin suspense, cannot be too cautiously concealed. When you have the\r\nhappiness of bestowing your sweet little Catherine, some years hence, on\r\na man who in connection and character is alike unexceptionable, you\r\nwill know what I feel now; though, thank Heaven, you cannot have all my\r\nreasons for rejoicing in such an event. Catherine will be amply provided\r\nfor, and not, like my Frederica, indebted to a fortunate\r\nestablishment for the comforts of life.\" She concluded by demanding\r\nmy congratulations. I gave them somewhat awkwardly, I believe; for, in\r\nfact, the sudden disclosure of so important a matter took from me the\r\npower of speaking with any clearness. She thanked me, however, most\r\naffectionately, for my kind concern in the welfare of herself and\r\ndaughter; and then said: \"I am not apt to deal in professions, my\r\ndear Mrs. Vernon, and I never had the convenient talent of affecting\r\nsensations foreign to my heart; and therefore I trust you will believe\r\nme when I declare, that much as I had heard in your praise before I knew\r\nyou, I had no idea that I should ever love you as I now do; and I\r\nmust further say that your friendship towards me is more particularly\r\ngratifying because I have reason to believe that some attempts were made\r\nto prejudice you against me. I only wish that they, whoever they are,\r\nto whom I am indebted for such kind intentions, could see the terms on\r\nwhich we now are together, and understand the real affection we feel\r\nfor each other; but I will not detain you any longer. God bless you, for\r\nyour goodness to me and my girl, and continue to you all your present\r\nhappiness.\" What can one say of such a woman, my dear mother? Such\r\nearnestness such solemnity of expression! and yet I cannot help\r\nsuspecting the truth of everything she says. As for Reginald, I believe\r\nhe does not know what to make of the matter. When Sir James came, he\r\nappeared all astonishment and perplexity; the folly of the young man and\r\nthe confusion of Frederica entirely engrossed him; and though a little\r\nprivate discourse with Lady Susan has since had its effect, he is still\r\nhurt, I am sure, at her allowing of such a man's attentions to her\r\ndaughter. Sir James invited himself with great composure to remain here\r\na few days--hoped we would not think it odd, was aware of its being very\r\nimpertinent, but he took the liberty of a relation; and concluded by\r\nwishing, with a laugh, that he might be really one very soon. Even Lady\r\nSusan seemed a little disconcerted by this forwardness; in her heart I\r\nam persuaded she sincerely wished him gone. But something must be done\r\nfor this poor girl, if her feelings are such as both I and her uncle\r\nbelieve them to be. She must not be sacrificed to policy or ambition,\r\nand she must not be left to suffer from the dread of it. The girl whose\r\nheart can distinguish Reginald De Courcy, deserves, however he may\r\nslight her, a better fate than to be Sir James Martin's wife. As soon\r\nas I can get her alone, I will discover the real truth; but she seems to\r\nwish to avoid me. I hope this does not proceed from anything wrong, and\r\nthat I shall not find out I have thought too well of her. Her\r\nbehaviour to Sir James certainly speaks the greatest consciousness and\r\nembarrassment, but I see nothing in it more like encouragement. Adieu,\r\nmy dear mother.\r\n\r\nYours, &c.,\r\n\r\nC. VERNON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nMISS VERNON TO MR DE COURCY\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,--I hope you will excuse this liberty; I am forced upon it by the\r\ngreatest distress, or I should be ashamed to trouble you. I am very\r\nmiserable about Sir James Martin, and have no other way in the world of\r\nhelping myself but by writing to you, for I am forbidden even speaking\r\nto my uncle and aunt on the subject; and this being the case, I am\r\nafraid my applying to you will appear no better than equivocation, and\r\nas if I attended to the letter and not the spirit of mamma's commands.\r\nBut if you do not take my part and persuade her to break it off, I shall\r\nbe half distracted, for I cannot bear him. No human being but YOU could\r\nhave any chance of prevailing with her. If you will, therefore, have the\r\nunspeakably great kindness of taking my part with her, and persuading\r\nher to send Sir James away, I shall be more obliged to you than it is\r\npossible for me to express. I always disliked him from the first: it is\r\nnot a sudden fancy, I assure you, sir; I always thought him silly and\r\nimpertinent and disagreeable, and now he is grown worse than ever. I\r\nwould rather work for my bread than marry him. I do not know how\r\nto apologize enough for this letter; I know it is taking so great a\r\nliberty. I am aware how dreadfully angry it will make mamma, but I\r\nremember the risk.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, your most humble servant,\r\n\r\nF. S. V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY SUSAN TO MRS. JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\nChurchhill.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is insufferable! My dearest friend, I was never so enraged before,\r\nand must relieve myself by writing to you, who I know will enter into\r\nall my feelings. Who should come on Tuesday but Sir James Martin! Guess\r\nmy astonishment, and vexation--for, as you well know, I never wished him\r\nto be seen at Churchhill. What a pity that you should not have known\r\nhis intentions! Not content with coming, he actually invited himself to\r\nremain here a few days. I could have poisoned him! I made the best of\r\nit, however, and told my story with great success to Mrs. Vernon, who,\r\nwhatever might be her real sentiments, said nothing in opposition to\r\nmine. I made a point also of Frederica's behaving civilly to Sir James,\r\nand gave her to understand that I was absolutely determined on her\r\nmarrying him. She said something of her misery, but that was all. I have\r\nfor some time been more particularly resolved on the match from seeing\r\nthe rapid increase of her affection for Reginald, and from not feeling\r\nsecure that a knowledge of such affection might not in the end awaken\r\na return. Contemptible as a regard founded only on compassion must make\r\nthem both in my eyes, I felt by no means assured that such might not be\r\nthe consequence. It is true that Reginald had not in any degree grown\r\ncool towards me; but yet he has lately mentioned Frederica spontaneously\r\nand unnecessarily, and once said something in praise of her person.\r\nHE was all astonishment at the appearance of my visitor, and at first\r\nobserved Sir James with an attention which I was pleased to see not\r\nunmixed with jealousy; but unluckily it was impossible for me really\r\nto torment him, as Sir James, though extremely gallant to me, very\r\nsoon made the whole party understand that his heart was devoted to my\r\ndaughter. I had no great difficulty in convincing De Courcy, when we\r\nwere alone, that I was perfectly justified, all things considered,\r\nin desiring the match; and the whole business seemed most comfortably\r\narranged. They could none of them help perceiving that Sir James was no\r\nSolomon; but I had positively forbidden Frederica complaining to Charles\r\nVernon or his wife, and they had therefore no pretence for interference;\r\nthough my impertinent sister, I believe, wanted only opportunity for\r\ndoing so. Everything, however, was going on calmly and quietly; and,\r\nthough I counted the hours of Sir James's stay, my mind was entirely\r\nsatisfied with the posture of affairs. Guess, then, what I must feel at\r\nthe sudden disturbance of all my schemes; and that, too, from a quarter\r\nwhere I had least reason to expect it. Reginald came this morning into\r\nmy dressing-room with a very unusual solemnity of countenance, and after\r\nsome preface informed me in so many words that he wished to reason with\r\nme on the impropriety and unkindness of allowing Sir James Martin to\r\naddress my daughter contrary to her inclinations. I was all amazement.\r\nWhen I found that he was not to be laughed out of his design, I calmly\r\nbegged an explanation, and desired to know by what he was impelled, and\r\nby whom commissioned, to reprimand me. He then told me, mixing in\r\nhis speech a few insolent compliments and ill-timed expressions of\r\ntenderness, to which I listened with perfect indifference, that my\r\ndaughter had acquainted him with some circumstances concerning herself,\r\nSir James, and me which had given him great uneasiness. In short, I\r\nfound that she had in the first place actually written to him to request\r\nhis interference, and that, on receiving her letter, he had conversed\r\nwith her on the subject of it, in order to understand the particulars,\r\nand to assure himself of her real wishes. I have not a doubt but that\r\nthe girl took this opportunity of making downright love to him. I am\r\nconvinced of it by the manner in which he spoke of her. Much good may\r\nsuch love do him! I shall ever despise the man who can be gratified by\r\nthe passion which he never wished to inspire, nor solicited the avowal\r\nof. I shall always detest them both. He can have no true regard for\r\nme, or he would not have listened to her; and SHE, with her little\r\nrebellious heart and indelicate feelings, to throw herself into the\r\nprotection of a young man with whom she has scarcely ever exchanged\r\ntwo words before! I am equally confounded at HER impudence and HIS\r\ncredulity. How dared he believe what she told him in my disfavour! Ought\r\nhe not to have felt assured that I must have unanswerable motives for\r\nall that I had done? Where was his reliance on my sense and goodness\r\nthen? Where the resentment which true love would have dictated against\r\nthe person defaming me--that person, too, a chit, a child, without\r\ntalent or education, whom he had been always taught to despise? I\r\nwas calm for some time; but the greatest degree of forbearance may be\r\novercome, and I hope I was afterwards sufficiently keen. He endeavoured,\r\nlong endeavoured, to soften my resentment; but that woman is a\r\nfool indeed who, while insulted by accusation, can be worked on by\r\ncompliments. At length he left me, as deeply provoked as myself; and\r\nhe showed his anger more. I was quite cool, but he gave way to the most\r\nviolent indignation; I may therefore expect it will the sooner subside,\r\nand perhaps his may be vanished for ever, while mine will be found still\r\nfresh and implacable. He is now shut up in his apartment, whither I\r\nheard him go on leaving mine. How unpleasant, one would think, must be\r\nhis reflections! but some people's feelings are incomprehensible. I have\r\nnot yet tranquillised myself enough to see Frederica. SHE shall not soon\r\nforget the occurrences of this day; she shall find that she has poured\r\nforth her tender tale of love in vain, and exposed herself for ever\r\nto the contempt of the whole world, and the severest resentment of her\r\ninjured mother.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate\r\n\r\nS. VERNON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. VERNON TO LADY DE COURCY\r\n\r\n\r\nChurchhill.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me congratulate you, my dearest Mother! The affair which has given\r\nus so much anxiety is drawing to a happy conclusion. Our prospect is\r\nmost delightful, and since matters have now taken so favourable a turn,\r\nI am quite sorry that I ever imparted my apprehensions to you; for the\r\npleasure of learning that the danger is over is perhaps dearly purchased\r\nby all that you have previously suffered. I am so much agitated by\r\ndelight that I can scarcely hold a pen; but am determined to send you\r\na few short lines by James, that you may have some explanation of what\r\nmust so greatly astonish you, as that Reginald should be returning to\r\nParklands. I was sitting about half an hour ago with Sir James in\r\nthe breakfast parlour, when my brother called me out of the room. I\r\ninstantly saw that something was the matter; his complexion was raised,\r\nand he spoke with great emotion; you know his eager manner, my dear\r\nmother, when his mind is interested. \"Catherine,\" said he, \"I am going\r\nhome to-day; I am sorry to leave you, but I must go: it is a great while\r\nsince I have seen my father and mother. I am going to send James forward\r\nwith my hunters immediately; if you have any letter, therefore, he can\r\ntake it. I shall not be at home myself till Wednesday or Thursday, as I\r\nshall go through London, where I have business; but before I leave you,\"\r\nhe continued, speaking in a lower tone, and with still greater energy,\r\n\"I must warn you of one thing--do not let Frederica Vernon be made\r\nunhappy by that Martin. He wants to marry her; her mother promotes the\r\nmatch, but she cannot endure the idea of it. Be assured that I speak\r\nfrom the fullest conviction of the truth of what I say; I know that\r\nFrederica is made wretched by Sir James's continuing here. She is a\r\nsweet girl, and deserves a better fate. Send him away immediately; he is\r\nonly a fool: but what her mother can mean, Heaven only knows! Good bye,\"\r\nhe added, shaking my hand with earnestness; \"I do not know when you will\r\nsee me again; but remember what I tell you of Frederica; you MUST make\r\nit your business to see justice done her. She is an amiable girl, and\r\nhas a very superior mind to what we have given her credit for.\" He then\r\nleft me, and ran upstairs. I would not try to stop him, for I know what\r\nhis feelings must be. The nature of mine, as I listened to him, I need\r\nnot attempt to describe; for a minute or two I remained in the same\r\nspot, overpowered by wonder of a most agreeable sort indeed; yet it\r\nrequired some consideration to be tranquilly happy. In about ten minutes\r\nafter my return to the parlour Lady Susan entered the room. I concluded,\r\nof course, that she and Reginald had been quarrelling; and looked with\r\nanxious curiosity for a confirmation of my belief in her face. Mistress\r\nof deceit, however, she appeared perfectly unconcerned, and after\r\nchatting on indifferent subjects for a short time, said to me, \"I find\r\nfrom Wilson that we are going to lose Mr. De Courcy--is it true that\r\nhe leaves Churchhill this morning?\" I replied that it was. \"He told\r\nus nothing of all this last night,\" said she, laughing, \"or even this\r\nmorning at breakfast; but perhaps he did not know it himself. Young men\r\nare often hasty in their resolutions, and not more sudden in forming\r\nthan unsteady in keeping them. I should not be surprised if he were to\r\nchange his mind at last, and not go.\" She soon afterwards left the room.\r\nI trust, however, my dear mother, that we have no reason to fear an\r\nalteration of his present plan; things have gone too far. They must have\r\nquarrelled, and about Frederica, too. Her calmness astonishes me. What\r\ndelight will be yours in seeing him again; in seeing him still worthy\r\nyour esteem, still capable of forming your happiness! When I next\r\nwrite I shall be able to tell you that Sir James is gone, Lady Susan\r\nvanquished, and Frederica at peace. We have much to do, but it shall\r\nbe done. I am all impatience to hear how this astonishing change was\r\neffected. I finish as I began, with the warmest congratulations.\r\n\r\nYours ever, &c.,\r\n\r\nCATH. VERNON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE SAME TO THE SAME\r\n\r\n\r\nChurchhill.\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle did I imagine, my dear Mother, when I sent off my last letter,\r\nthat the delightful perturbation of spirits I was then in would undergo\r\nso speedy, so melancholy a reverse. I never can sufficiently regret that\r\nI wrote to you at all. Yet who could have foreseen what has happened?\r\nMy dear mother, every hope which made me so happy only two hours ago has\r\nvanished. The quarrel between Lady Susan and Reginald is made up, and we\r\nare all as we were before. One point only is gained. Sir James Martin is\r\ndismissed. What are we now to look forward to? I am indeed disappointed;\r\nReginald was all but gone, his horse was ordered and all but brought\r\nto the door; who would not have felt safe? For half an hour I was in\r\nmomentary expectation of his departure. After I had sent off my letter\r\nto you, I went to Mr. Vernon, and sat with him in his room talking over\r\nthe whole matter, and then determined to look for Frederica, whom I had\r\nnot seen since breakfast. I met her on the stairs, and saw that she was\r\ncrying. \"My dear aunt,\" said she, \"he is going--Mr. De Courcy is going,\r\nand it is all my fault. I am afraid you will be very angry with me, but\r\nindeed I had no idea it would end so.\" \"My love,\" I replied, \"do not\r\nthink it necessary to apologize to me on that account. I shall feel\r\nmyself under an obligation to anyone who is the means of sending my\r\nbrother home, because,\" recollecting myself, \"I know my father wants\r\nvery much to see him. But what is it you have done to occasion all\r\nthis?\" She blushed deeply as she answered: \"I was so unhappy about Sir\r\nJames that I could not help--I have done something very wrong, I know;\r\nbut you have not an idea of the misery I have been in: and mamma had\r\nordered me never to speak to you or my uncle about it, and--\" \"You\r\ntherefore spoke to my brother to engage his interference,\" said I, to\r\nsave her the explanation. \"No, but I wrote to him--I did indeed, I got\r\nup this morning before it was light, and was two hours about it; and\r\nwhen my letter was done I thought I never should have courage to give\r\nit. After breakfast however, as I was going to my room, I met him in the\r\npassage, and then, as I knew that everything must depend on that moment,\r\nI forced myself to give it. He was so good as to take it immediately. I\r\ndared not look at him, and ran away directly. I was in such a fright I\r\ncould hardly breathe. My dear aunt, you do not know how miserable I\r\nhave been.\" \"Frederica\" said I, \"you ought to have told me all your\r\ndistresses. You would have found in me a friend always ready to assist\r\nyou. Do you think that your uncle or I should not have espoused your\r\ncause as warmly as my brother?\" \"Indeed, I did not doubt your kindness,\"\r\nsaid she, colouring again, \"but I thought Mr. De Courcy could do\r\nanything with my mother; but I was mistaken: they have had a dreadful\r\nquarrel about it, and he is going away. Mamma will never forgive me,\r\nand I shall be worse off than ever.\" \"No, you shall not,\" I replied;\r\n\"in such a point as this your mother's prohibition ought not to have\r\nprevented your speaking to me on the subject. She has no right to\r\nmake you unhappy, and she shall NOT do it. Your applying, however, to\r\nReginald can be productive only of good to all parties. I believe it\r\nis best as it is. Depend upon it that you shall not be made unhappy any\r\nlonger.\" At that moment how great was my astonishment at seeing Reginald\r\ncome out of Lady Susan's dressing-room. My heart misgave me instantly.\r\nHis confusion at seeing me was very evident. Frederica immediately\r\ndisappeared. \"Are you going?\" I said; \"you will find Mr. Vernon in his\r\nown room.\" \"No, Catherine,\" he replied, \"I am not going. Will you let\r\nme speak to you a moment?\" We went into my room. \"I find,\" he continued,\r\nhis confusion increasing as he spoke, \"that I have been acting with my\r\nusual foolish impetuosity. I have entirely misunderstood Lady Susan, and\r\nwas on the point of leaving the house under a false impression of\r\nher conduct. There has been some very great mistake; we have been all\r\nmistaken, I fancy. Frederica does not know her mother. Lady Susan means\r\nnothing but her good, but she will not make a friend of her. Lady Susan\r\ndoes not always know, therefore, what will make her daughter happy.\r\nBesides, I could have no right to interfere. Miss Vernon was mistaken in\r\napplying to me. In short, Catherine, everything has gone wrong, but it\r\nis now all happily settled. Lady Susan, I believe, wishes to speak to\r\nyou about it, if you are at leisure.\" \"Certainly,\" I replied, deeply\r\nsighing at the recital of so lame a story. I made no comments, however,\r\nfor words would have been vain.\r\n\r\nReginald was glad to get away, and I went to Lady Susan, curious,\r\nindeed, to hear her account of it. \"Did I not tell you,\" said she with\r\na smile, \"that your brother would not leave us after all?\" \"You did,\r\nindeed,\" replied I very gravely; \"but I flattered myself you would be\r\nmistaken.\" \"I should not have hazarded such an opinion,\" returned she,\r\n\"if it had not at that moment occurred to me that his resolution of\r\ngoing might be occasioned by a conversation in which we had been this\r\nmorning engaged, and which had ended very much to his dissatisfaction,\r\nfrom our not rightly understanding each other's meaning. This idea\r\nstruck me at the moment, and I instantly determined that an accidental\r\ndispute, in which I might probably be as much to blame as himself,\r\nshould not deprive you of your brother. If you remember, I left the room\r\nalmost immediately. I was resolved to lose no time in clearing up those\r\nmistakes as far as I could. The case was this--Frederica had set herself\r\nviolently against marrying Sir James.\" \"And can your ladyship wonder\r\nthat she should?\" cried I with some warmth; \"Frederica has an excellent\r\nunderstanding, and Sir James has none.\" \"I am at least very far from\r\nregretting it, my dear sister,\" said she; \"on the contrary, I am\r\ngrateful for so favourable a sign of my daughter's sense. Sir James is\r\ncertainly below par (his boyish manners make him appear worse); and had\r\nFrederica possessed the penetration and the abilities which I could have\r\nwished in my daughter, or had I even known her to possess as much as she\r\ndoes, I should not have been anxious for the match.\" \"It is odd that\r\nyou should alone be ignorant of your daughter's sense!\" \"Frederica never\r\ndoes justice to herself; her manners are shy and childish, and besides\r\nshe is afraid of me. During her poor father's life she was a spoilt\r\nchild; the severity which it has since been necessary for me to show\r\nhas alienated her affection; neither has she any of that brilliancy\r\nof intellect, that genius or vigour of mind which will force itself\r\nforward.\" \"Say rather that she has been unfortunate in her education!\"\r\n\"Heaven knows, my dearest Mrs. Vernon, how fully I am aware of that; but\r\nI would wish to forget every circumstance that might throw blame on the\r\nmemory of one whose name is sacred with me.\" Here she pretended to cry;\r\nI was out of patience with her. \"But what,\" said I, \"was your ladyship\r\ngoing to tell me about your disagreement with my brother?\" \"It\r\noriginated in an action of my daughter's, which equally marks her want\r\nof judgment and the unfortunate dread of me I have been mentioning--she\r\nwrote to Mr. De Courcy.\" \"I know she did; you had forbidden her speaking\r\nto Mr. Vernon or to me on the cause of her distress; what could she do,\r\ntherefore, but apply to my brother?\" \"Good God!\" she exclaimed, \"what an\r\nopinion you must have of me! Can you possibly suppose that I was\r\naware of her unhappiness! that it was my object to make my own child\r\nmiserable, and that I had forbidden her speaking to you on the subject\r\nfrom a fear of your interrupting the diabolical scheme? Do you think\r\nme destitute of every honest, every natural feeling? Am I capable of\r\nconsigning HER to everlasting misery whose welfare it is my first\r\nearthly duty to promote? The idea is horrible!\" \"What, then, was your\r\nintention when you insisted on her silence?\" \"Of what use, my dear\r\nsister, could be any application to you, however the affair might stand?\r\nWhy should I subject you to entreaties which I refused to attend to\r\nmyself? Neither for your sake nor for hers, nor for my own, could such\r\na thing be desirable. When my own resolution was taken I could not\r\nwish for the interference, however friendly, of another person. I was\r\nmistaken, it is true, but I believed myself right.\" \"But what was this\r\nmistake to which your ladyship so often alludes! from whence arose so\r\nastonishing a misconception of your daughter's feelings! Did you not\r\nknow that she disliked Sir James?\" \"I knew that he was not absolutely\r\nthe man she would have chosen, but I was persuaded that her objections\r\nto him did not arise from any perception of his deficiency. You must\r\nnot question me, however, my dear sister, too minutely on this point,\"\r\ncontinued she, taking me affectionately by the hand; \"I honestly own\r\nthat there is something to conceal. Frederica makes me very unhappy! Her\r\napplying to Mr. De Courcy hurt me particularly.\" \"What is it you mean\r\nto infer,\" said I, \"by this appearance of mystery? If you think your\r\ndaughter at all attached to Reginald, her objecting to Sir James could\r\nnot less deserve to be attended to than if the cause of her objecting\r\nhad been a consciousness of his folly; and why should your ladyship,\r\nat any rate, quarrel with my brother for an interference which, you must\r\nknow, it is not in his nature to refuse when urged in such a manner?\"\r\n\r\n\"His disposition, you know, is warm, and he came to expostulate with\r\nme; his compassion all alive for this ill-used girl, this heroine in\r\ndistress! We misunderstood each other: he believed me more to blame than\r\nI really was; I considered his interference less excusable than I\r\nnow find it. I have a real regard for him, and was beyond expression\r\nmortified to find it, as I thought, so ill bestowed. We were both warm,\r\nand of course both to blame. His resolution of leaving Churchhill is\r\nconsistent with his general eagerness. When I understood his intention,\r\nhowever, and at the same time began to think that we had been perhaps\r\nequally mistaken in each other's meaning, I resolved to have an\r\nexplanation before it was too late. For any member of your family I must\r\nalways feel a degree of affection, and I own it would have sensibly hurt\r\nme if my acquaintance with Mr. De Courcy had ended so gloomily. I have\r\nnow only to say further, that as I am convinced of Frederica's having\r\na reasonable dislike to Sir James, I shall instantly inform him that he\r\nmust give up all hope of her. I reproach myself for having, even though\r\ninnocently, made her unhappy on that score. She shall have all the\r\nretribution in my power to make; if she value her own happiness as much\r\nas I do, if she judge wisely, and command herself as she ought, she may\r\nnow be easy. Excuse me, my dearest sister, for thus trespassing on your\r\ntime, but I owe it to my own character; and after this explanation I\r\ntrust I am in no danger of sinking in your opinion.\" I could have\r\nsaid, \"Not much, indeed!\" but I left her almost in silence. It was\r\nthe greatest stretch of forbearance I could practise. I could not have\r\nstopped myself had I begun. Her assurance! her deceit! but I will not\r\nallow myself to dwell on them; they will strike you sufficiently. My\r\nheart sickens within me. As soon as I was tolerably composed I returned\r\nto the parlour. Sir James's carriage was at the door, and he, merry\r\nas usual, soon afterwards took his leave. How easily does her ladyship\r\nencourage or dismiss a lover! In spite of this release, Frederica still\r\nlooks unhappy: still fearful, perhaps, of her mother's anger; and though\r\ndreading my brother's departure, jealous, it may be, of his staying. I\r\nsee how closely she observes him and Lady Susan, poor girl! I have now\r\nno hope for her. There is not a chance of her affection being returned.\r\nHe thinks very differently of her from what he used to do; he does her\r\nsome justice, but his reconciliation with her mother precludes every\r\ndearer hope. Prepare, my dear mother, for the worst! The probability of\r\ntheir marrying is surely heightened! He is more securely hers than ever.\r\nWhen that wretched event takes place, Frederica must belong wholly to\r\nus. I am thankful that my last letter will precede this by so little, as\r\nevery moment that you can be saved from feeling a joy which leads only\r\nto disappointment is of consequence.\r\n\r\nYours ever, &c.,\r\n\r\nCATHERINE VERNON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY SUSAN TO MRS. JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\nChurchhill.\r\n\r\n\r\nI call on you, dear Alicia, for congratulations: I am my own self, gay\r\nand triumphant! When I wrote to you the other day I was, in truth, in\r\nhigh irritation, and with ample cause. Nay, I know not whether I ought\r\nto be quite tranquil now, for I have had more trouble in restoring\r\npeace than I ever intended to submit to--a spirit, too, resulting from\r\na fancied sense of superior integrity, which is peculiarly insolent! I\r\nshall not easily forgive him, I assure you. He was actually on the point\r\nof leaving Churchhill! I had scarcely concluded my last, when Wilson\r\nbrought me word of it. I found, therefore, that something must be done;\r\nfor I did not choose to leave my character at the mercy of a man whose\r\npassions are so violent and so revengeful. It would have been trifling\r\nwith my reputation to allow of his departing with such an impression in\r\nmy disfavour; in this light, condescension was necessary. I sent\r\nWilson to say that I desired to speak with him before he went; he came\r\nimmediately. The angry emotions which had marked every feature when we\r\nlast parted were partially subdued. He seemed astonished at the summons,\r\nand looked as if half wishing and half fearing to be softened by what I\r\nmight say. If my countenance expressed what I aimed at, it was composed\r\nand dignified; and yet, with a degree of pensiveness which might\r\nconvince him that I was not quite happy. \"I beg your pardon, sir, for\r\nthe liberty I have taken in sending for you,\" said I; \"but as I have\r\njust learnt your intention of leaving this place to-day, I feel it my\r\nduty to entreat that you will not on my account shorten your visit here\r\neven an hour. I am perfectly aware that after what has passed between\r\nus it would ill suit the feelings of either to remain longer in the same\r\nhouse: so very great, so total a change from the intimacy of friendship\r\nmust render any future intercourse the severest punishment; and your\r\nresolution of quitting Churchhill is undoubtedly in unison with our\r\nsituation, and with those lively feelings which I know you to possess.\r\nBut, at the same time, it is not for me to suffer such a sacrifice as it\r\nmust be to leave relations to whom you are so much attached, and are so\r\ndear. My remaining here cannot give that pleasure to Mr. and Mrs. Vernon\r\nwhich your society must; and my visit has already perhaps been too long.\r\nMy removal, therefore, which must, at any rate, take place soon, may,\r\nwith perfect convenience, be hastened; and I make it my particular\r\nrequest that I may not in any way be instrumental in separating a\r\nfamily so affectionately attached to each other. Where I go is of\r\nno consequence to anyone; of very little to myself; but you are of\r\nimportance to all your connections.\" Here I concluded, and I hope you\r\nwill be satisfied with my speech. Its effect on Reginald justifies some\r\nportion of vanity, for it was no less favourable than instantaneous. Oh,\r\nhow delightful it was to watch the variations of his countenance while I\r\nspoke! to see the struggle between returning tenderness and the remains\r\nof displeasure. There is something agreeable in feelings so easily\r\nworked on; not that I envy him their possession, nor would, for the\r\nworld, have such myself; but they are very convenient when one wishes\r\nto influence the passions of another. And yet this Reginald, whom a\r\nvery few words from me softened at once into the utmost submission, and\r\nrendered more tractable, more attached, more devoted than ever, would\r\nhave left me in the first angry swelling of his proud heart without\r\ndeigning to seek an explanation. Humbled as he now is, I cannot forgive\r\nhim such an instance of pride, and am doubtful whether I ought not to\r\npunish him by dismissing him at once after this reconciliation, or\r\nby marrying and teazing him for ever. But these measures are each too\r\nviolent to be adopted without some deliberation; at present my thoughts\r\nare fluctuating between various schemes. I have many things to compass:\r\nI must punish Frederica, and pretty severely too, for her application to\r\nReginald; I must punish him for receiving it so favourably, and for the\r\nrest of his conduct. I must torment my sister-in-law for the insolent\r\ntriumph of her look and manner since Sir James has been dismissed; for,\r\nin reconciling Reginald to me, I was not able to save that ill-fated\r\nyoung man; and I must make myself amends for the humiliation to which\r\nI have stooped within these few days. To effect all this I have various\r\nplans. I have also an idea of being soon in town; and whatever may be\r\nmy determination as to the rest, I shall probably put THAT project\r\nin execution; for London will be always the fairest field of action,\r\nhowever my views may be directed; and at any rate I shall there be\r\nrewarded by your society, and a little dissipation, for a ten weeks'\r\npenance at Churchhill. I believe I owe it to my character to complete\r\nthe match between my daughter and Sir James after having so long\r\nintended it. Let me know your opinion on this point. Flexibility of\r\nmind, a disposition easily biassed by others, is an attribute which you\r\nknow I am not very desirous of obtaining; nor has Frederica any claim\r\nto the indulgence of her notions at the expense of her mother's\r\ninclinations. Her idle love for Reginald, too! It is surely my duty to\r\ndiscourage such romantic nonsense. All things considered, therefore, it\r\nseems incumbent on me to take her to town and marry her immediately to\r\nSir James. When my own will is effected contrary to his, I shall have\r\nsome credit in being on good terms with Reginald, which at present, in\r\nfact, I have not; for though he is still in my power, I have given up\r\nthe very article by which our quarrel was produced, and at best the\r\nhonour of victory is doubtful. Send me your opinion on all these\r\nmatters, my dear Alicia, and let me know whether you can get lodgings to\r\nsuit me within a short distance of you.\r\n\r\nYour most attached\r\n\r\nS. VERNON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. JOHNSON TO LADY SUSAN\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am gratified by your reference, and this is my advice: that you come\r\nto town yourself, without loss of time, but that you leave Frederica\r\nbehind. It would surely be much more to the purpose to get yourself well\r\nestablished by marrying Mr. De Courcy, than to irritate him and the rest\r\nof his family by making her marry Sir James. You should think more of\r\nyourself and less of your daughter. She is not of a disposition to do\r\nyou credit in the world, and seems precisely in her proper place at\r\nChurchhill, with the Vernons. But you are fitted for society, and it\r\nis shameful to have you exiled from it. Leave Frederica, therefore,\r\nto punish herself for the plague she has given you, by indulging that\r\nromantic tender-heartedness which will always ensure her misery enough,\r\nand come to London as soon as you can. I have another reason for urging\r\nthis: Mainwaring came to town last week, and has contrived, in spite\r\nof Mr. Johnson, to make opportunities of seeing me. He is absolutely\r\nmiserable about you, and jealous to such a degree of De Courcy that it\r\nwould be highly unadvisable for them to meet at present. And yet, if you\r\ndo not allow him to see you here, I cannot answer for his not committing\r\nsome great imprudence--such as going to Churchhill, for instance, which\r\nwould be dreadful! Besides, if you take my advice, and resolve to marry\r\nDe Courcy, it will be indispensably necessary to you to get Mainwaring\r\nout of the way; and you only can have influence enough to send him back\r\nto his wife. I have still another motive for your coming: Mr. Johnson\r\nleaves London next Tuesday; he is going for his health to Bath, where,\r\nif the waters are favourable to his constitution and my wishes, he will\r\nbe laid up with the gout many weeks. During his absence we shall be able\r\nto chuse our own society, and to have true enjoyment. I would ask you to\r\nEdward Street, but that once he forced from me a kind of promise never\r\nto invite you to my house; nothing but my being in the utmost distress\r\nfor money should have extorted it from me. I can get you, however,\r\na nice drawing-room apartment in Upper Seymour Street, and we may be\r\nalways together there or here; for I consider my promise to Mr. Johnson\r\nas comprehending only (at least in his absence) your not sleeping in the\r\nhouse. Poor Mainwaring gives me such histories of his wife's jealousy.\r\nSilly woman to expect constancy from so charming a man! but she always\r\nwas silly--intolerably so in marrying him at all, she the heiress of a\r\nlarge fortune and he without a shilling: one title, I know, she might\r\nhave had, besides baronets. Her folly in forming the connection was so\r\ngreat that, though Mr. Johnson was her guardian, and I do not in general\r\nshare HIS feelings, I never can forgive her.\r\n\r\nAdieu. Yours ever,\r\n\r\nALICIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. VERNON TO LADY DE COURCY\r\n\r\n\r\nChurchhill.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter, my dear Mother, will be brought you by Reginald. His long\r\nvisit is about to be concluded at last, but I fear the separation takes\r\nplace too late to do us any good. She is going to London to see her\r\nparticular friend, Mrs. Johnson. It was at first her intention that\r\nFrederica should accompany her, for the benefit of masters, but we\r\noverruled her there. Frederica was wretched in the idea of going, and\r\nI could not bear to have her at the mercy of her mother; not all the\r\nmasters in London could compensate for the ruin of her comfort. I\r\nshould have feared, too, for her health, and for everything but her\r\nprinciples--there I believe she is not to be injured by her mother, or\r\nher mother's friends; but with those friends she must have mixed (a very\r\nbad set, I doubt not), or have been left in total solitude, and I can\r\nhardly tell which would have been worse for her. If she is with her\r\nmother, moreover, she must, alas! in all probability be with Reginald,\r\nand that would be the greatest evil of all. Here we shall in time be in\r\npeace, and our regular employments, our books and conversations, with\r\nexercise, the children, and every domestic pleasure in my power to\r\nprocure her, will, I trust, gradually overcome this youthful attachment.\r\nI should not have a doubt of it were she slighted for any other woman in\r\nthe world than her own mother. How long Lady Susan will be in town, or\r\nwhether she returns here again, I know not. I could not be cordial in my\r\ninvitation, but if she chuses to come no want of cordiality on my part\r\nwill keep her away. I could not help asking Reginald if he intended\r\nbeing in London this winter, as soon as I found her ladyship's\r\nsteps would be bent thither; and though he professed himself quite\r\nundetermined, there was something in his look and voice as he spoke\r\nwhich contradicted his words. I have done with lamentation; I look upon\r\nthe event as so far decided that I resign myself to it in despair. If he\r\nleaves you soon for London everything will be concluded.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate, &c.,\r\n\r\nC. VERNON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. JOHNSON TO LADY SUSAN\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dearest Friend,--I write in the greatest distress; the most\r\nunfortunate event has just taken place. Mr. Johnson has hit on the most\r\neffectual manner of plaguing us all. He had heard, I imagine, by some\r\nmeans or other, that you were soon to be in London, and immediately\r\ncontrived to have such an attack of the gout as must at least delay his\r\njourney to Bath, if not wholly prevent it. I am persuaded the gout is\r\nbrought on or kept off at pleasure; it was the same when I wanted to\r\njoin the Hamiltons to the Lakes; and three years ago, when I had a fancy\r\nfor Bath, nothing could induce him to have a gouty symptom.\r\n\r\nI am pleased to find that my letter had so much effect on you, and that\r\nDe Courcy is certainly your own. Let me hear from you as soon as you\r\narrive, and in particular tell me what you mean to do with Mainwaring.\r\nIt is impossible to say when I shall be able to come to you; my\r\nconfinement must be great. It is such an abominable trick to be ill here\r\ninstead of at Bath that I can scarcely command myself at all. At Bath\r\nhis old aunts would have nursed him, but here it all falls upon me; and\r\nhe bears pain with such patience that I have not the common excuse for\r\nlosing my temper.\r\n\r\nYours ever,\r\n\r\nALICIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY SUSAN VERNON TO MRS. JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\nUpper Seymour Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Alicia,--There needed not this last fit of the gout to make\r\nme detest Mr. Johnson, but now the extent of my aversion is not to\r\nbe estimated. To have you confined as nurse in his apartment! My dear\r\nAlicia, of what a mistake were you guilty in marrying a man of his age!\r\njust old enough to be formal, ungovernable, and to have the gout; too\r\nold to be agreeable, too young to die. I arrived last night about five,\r\nhad scarcely swallowed my dinner when Mainwaring made his appearance.\r\nI will not dissemble what real pleasure his sight afforded me, nor how\r\nstrongly I felt the contrast between his person and manners and those of\r\nReginald, to the infinite disadvantage of the latter. For an hour or two\r\nI was even staggered in my resolution of marrying him, and though this\r\nwas too idle and nonsensical an idea to remain long on my mind, I do not\r\nfeel very eager for the conclusion of my marriage, nor look forward with\r\nmuch impatience to the time when Reginald, according to our agreement,\r\nis to be in town. I shall probably put off his arrival under some\r\npretence or other. He must not come till Mainwaring is gone. I am still\r\ndoubtful at times as to marrying; if the old man would die I might not\r\nhesitate, but a state of dependance on the caprice of Sir Reginald will\r\nnot suit the freedom of my spirit; and if I resolve to wait for that\r\nevent, I shall have excuse enough at present in having been scarcely ten\r\nmonths a widow. I have not given Mainwaring any hint of my intention, or\r\nallowed him to consider my acquaintance with Reginald as more than the\r\ncommonest flirtation, and he is tolerably appeased. Adieu, till we meet;\r\nI am enchanted with my lodgings.\r\n\r\nYours ever,\r\n\r\nS. VERNON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY SUSAN VERNON TO MR. DE COURCY\r\n\r\n\r\nUpper Seymour Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have received your letter, and though I do not attempt to conceal that\r\nI am gratified by your impatience for the hour of meeting, I yet\r\nfeel myself under the necessity of delaying that hour beyond the time\r\noriginally fixed. Do not think me unkind for such an exercise of my\r\npower, nor accuse me of instability without first hearing my reasons.\r\nIn the course of my journey from Churchhill I had ample leisure for\r\nreflection on the present state of our affairs, and every review has\r\nserved to convince me that they require a delicacy and cautiousness of\r\nconduct to which we have hitherto been too little attentive. We have\r\nbeen hurried on by our feelings to a degree of precipitation which ill\r\naccords with the claims of our friends or the opinion of the world. We\r\nhave been unguarded in forming this hasty engagement, but we must not\r\ncomplete the imprudence by ratifying it while there is so much reason\r\nto fear the connection would be opposed by those friends on whom you\r\ndepend. It is not for us to blame any expectations on your father's side\r\nof your marrying to advantage; where possessions are so extensive as\r\nthose of your family, the wish of increasing them, if not strictly\r\nreasonable, is too common to excite surprize or resentment. He has a\r\nright to require; a woman of fortune in his daughter-in-law, and I am\r\nsometimes quarrelling with myself for suffering you to form a connection\r\nso imprudent; but the influence of reason is often acknowledged too late\r\nby those who feel like me. I have now been but a few months a widow,\r\nand, however little indebted to my husband's memory for any happiness\r\nderived from him during a union of some years, I cannot forget that the\r\nindelicacy of so early a second marriage must subject me to the censure\r\nof the world, and incur, what would be still more insupportable, the\r\ndispleasure of Mr. Vernon. I might perhaps harden myself in time against\r\nthe injustice of general reproach, but the loss of HIS valued esteem\r\nI am, as you well know, ill-fitted to endure; and when to this may be\r\nadded the consciousness of having injured you with your family, how am I\r\nto support myself? With feelings so poignant as mine, the conviction of\r\nhaving divided the son from his parents would make me, even with you,\r\nthe most miserable of beings. It will surely, therefore, be advisable to\r\ndelay our union--to delay it till appearances are more promising--till\r\naffairs have taken a more favourable turn. To assist us in such a\r\nresolution I feel that absence will be necessary. We must not meet.\r\nCruel as this sentence may appear, the necessity of pronouncing it,\r\nwhich can alone reconcile it to myself, will be evident to you when you\r\nhave considered our situation in the light in which I have found myself\r\nimperiously obliged to place it. You may be--you must be--well assured\r\nthat nothing but the strongest conviction of duty could induce me\r\nto wound my own feelings by urging a lengthened separation, and of\r\ninsensibility to yours you will hardly suspect me. Again, therefore,\r\nI say that we ought not, we must not, yet meet. By a removal for some\r\nmonths from each other we shall tranquillise the sisterly fears of Mrs.\r\nVernon, who, accustomed herself to the enjoyment of riches, considers\r\nfortune as necessary everywhere, and whose sensibilities are not of a\r\nnature to comprehend ours. Let me hear from you soon--very soon. Tell me\r\nthat you submit to my arguments, and do not reproach me for using such.\r\nI cannot bear reproaches: my spirits are not so high as to need being\r\nrepressed. I must endeavour to seek amusement, and fortunately many\r\nof my friends are in town; amongst them the Mainwarings; you know how\r\nsincerely I regard both husband and wife.\r\n\r\nI am, very faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nS. VERNON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY SUSAN TO MRS. JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\nUpper Seymour Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Friend,--That tormenting creature, Reginald, is here. My letter,\r\nwhich was intended to keep him longer in the country, has hastened him\r\nto town. Much as I wish him away, however, I cannot help being pleased\r\nwith such a proof of attachment. He is devoted to me, heart and soul.\r\nHe will carry this note himself, which is to serve as an introduction to\r\nyou, with whom he longs to be acquainted. Allow him to spend the evening\r\nwith you, that I may be in no danger of his returning here. I have told\r\nhim that I am not quite well, and must be alone; and should he call\r\nagain there might be confusion, for it is impossible to be sure of\r\nservants. Keep him, therefore, I entreat you, in Edward Street. You will\r\nnot find him a heavy companion, and I allow you to flirt with him as\r\nmuch as you like. At the same time, do not forget my real interest; say\r\nall that you can to convince him that I shall be quite wretched if he\r\nremains here; you know my reasons--propriety, and so forth. I would\r\nurge them more myself, but that I am impatient to be rid of him, as\r\nMainwaring comes within half an hour. Adieu!\r\n\r\nS VERNON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. JOHNSON TO LADY SUSAN\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Creature,--I am in agonies, and know not what to do. Mr. De\r\nCourcy arrived just when he should not. Mrs. Mainwaring had that instant\r\nentered the house, and forced herself into her guardian's presence,\r\nthough I did not know a syllable of it till afterwards, for I was out\r\nwhen both she and Reginald came, or I should have sent him away at all\r\nevents; but she was shut up with Mr. Johnson, while he waited in the\r\ndrawing-room for me. She arrived yesterday in pursuit of her husband,\r\nbut perhaps you know this already from himself. She came to this house\r\nto entreat my husband's interference, and before I could be aware of\r\nit, everything that you could wish to be concealed was known to him, and\r\nunluckily she had wormed out of Mainwaring's servant that he had visited\r\nyou every day since your being in town, and had just watched him to your\r\ndoor herself! What could I do! Facts are such horrid things! All is by\r\nthis time known to De Courcy, who is now alone with Mr. Johnson. Do not\r\naccuse me; indeed, it was impossible to prevent it. Mr. Johnson has for\r\nsome time suspected De Courcy of intending to marry you, and would\r\nspeak with him alone as soon as he knew him to be in the house. That\r\ndetestable Mrs. Mainwaring, who, for your comfort, has fretted herself\r\nthinner and uglier than ever, is still here, and they have been all\r\ncloseted together. What can be done? At any rate, I hope he will plague\r\nhis wife more than ever. With anxious wishes, Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nALICIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY SUSAN TO MRS. JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\nUpper Seymour Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis eclaircissement is rather provoking. How unlucky that you should\r\nhave been from home! I thought myself sure of you at seven! I am\r\nundismayed however. Do not torment yourself with fears on my account;\r\ndepend on it, I can make my story good with Reginald. Mainwaring is just\r\ngone; he brought me the news of his wife's arrival. Silly woman, what\r\ndoes she expect by such manoeuvres? Yet I wish she had stayed quietly\r\nat Langford. Reginald will be a little enraged at first, but by\r\nto-morrow's dinner, everything will be well again.\r\n\r\nAdieu!\r\n\r\nS. V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. DE COURCY TO LADY SUSAN\r\n\r\n\r\n--Hotel\r\n\r\n\r\nI write only to bid you farewell, the spell is removed; I see you as\r\nyou are. Since we parted yesterday, I have received from indisputable\r\nauthority such a history of you as must bring the most mortifying\r\nconviction of the imposition I have been under, and the absolute\r\nnecessity of an immediate and eternal separation from you. You\r\ncannot doubt to what I allude. Langford! Langford! that word will be\r\nsufficient. I received my information in Mr. Johnson's house, from Mrs.\r\nMainwaring herself. You know how I have loved you; you can intimately\r\njudge of my present feelings, but I am not so weak as to find indulgence\r\nin describing them to a woman who will glory in having excited their\r\nanguish, but whose affection they have never been able to gain.\r\n\r\nR. DE COURCY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY SUSAN TO MR. DE COURCY\r\n\r\n\r\nUpper Seymour Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to describe my astonishment in reading the note this\r\nmoment received from you. I am bewildered in my endeavours to form\r\nsome rational conjecture of what Mrs. Mainwaring can have told you\r\nto occasion so extraordinary a change in your sentiments. Have I not\r\nexplained everything to you with respect to myself which could bear a\r\ndoubtful meaning, and which the ill-nature of the world had interpreted\r\nto my discredit? What can you now have heard to stagger your esteem for\r\nme? Have I ever had a concealment from you? Reginald, you agitate\r\nme beyond expression, I cannot suppose that the old story of Mrs.\r\nMainwaring's jealousy can be revived again, or at least be LISTENED to\r\nagain. Come to me immediately, and explain what is at present absolutely\r\nincomprehensible. Believe me the single word of Langford is not of such\r\npotent intelligence as to supersede the necessity of more. If we ARE to\r\npart, it will at least be handsome to take your personal leave--but\r\nI have little heart to jest; in truth, I am serious enough; for to be\r\nsunk, though but for an hour, in your esteem is a humiliation to which I\r\nknow not how to submit. I shall count every minute till your arrival.\r\n\r\nS. V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. DE COURCY TO LADY SUSAN\r\n\r\n\r\n----Hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy would you write to me? Why do you require particulars? But, since\r\nit must be so, I am obliged to declare that all the accounts of your\r\nmisconduct during the life, and since the death of Mr. Vernon, which had\r\nreached me, in common with the world in general, and gained my entire\r\nbelief before I saw you, but which you, by the exertion of your\r\nperverted abilities, had made me resolved to disallow, have been\r\nunanswerably proved to me; nay more, I am assured that a connection,\r\nof which I had never before entertained a thought, has for some time\r\nexisted, and still continues to exist, between you and the man whose\r\nfamily you robbed of its peace in return for the hospitality with which\r\nyou were received into it; that you have corresponded with him ever\r\nsince your leaving Langford; not with his wife, but with him, and that\r\nhe now visits you every day. Can you, dare you deny it? and all this at\r\nthe time when I was an encouraged, an accepted lover! From what have I\r\nnot escaped! I have only to be grateful. Far from me be all complaint,\r\nevery sigh of regret. My own folly had endangered me, my preservation I\r\nowe to the kindness, the integrity of another; but the unfortunate Mrs.\r\nMainwaring, whose agonies while she related the past seemed to threaten\r\nher reason, how is SHE to be consoled! After such a discovery as this,\r\nyou will scarcely affect further wonder at my meaning in bidding you\r\nadieu. My understanding is at length restored, and teaches no less to\r\nabhor the artifices which had subdued me than to despise myself for the\r\nweakness on which their strength was founded.\r\n\r\nR. DE COURCY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY SUSAN TO MR. DE COURCY\r\n\r\n\r\nUpper Seymour Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am satisfied, and will trouble you no more when these few lines are\r\ndismissed. The engagement which you were eager to form a fortnight ago\r\nis no longer compatible with your views, and I rejoice to find that\r\nthe prudent advice of your parents has not been given in vain. Your\r\nrestoration to peace will, I doubt not, speedily follow this act of\r\nfilial obedience, and I flatter myself with the hope of surviving my\r\nshare in this disappointment.\r\n\r\nS. V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. JOHNSON TO LADY SUSAN VERNON\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward Street\r\n\r\n\r\nI am grieved, though I cannot be astonished at your rupture with Mr.\r\nDe Courcy; he has just informed Mr. Johnson of it by letter. He leaves\r\nLondon, he says, to-day. Be assured that I partake in all your feelings,\r\nand do not be angry if I say that our intercourse, even by letter, must\r\nsoon be given up. It makes me miserable; but Mr. Johnson vows that if I\r\npersist in the connection, he will settle in the country for the rest of\r\nhis life, and you know it is impossible to submit to such an extremity\r\nwhile any other alternative remains. You have heard of course that the\r\nMainwarings are to part, and I am afraid Mrs. M. will come home to us\r\nagain; but she is still so fond of her husband, and frets so much about\r\nhim, that perhaps she may not live long. Miss Mainwaring is just come to\r\ntown to be with her aunt, and they say that she declares she will have\r\nSir James Martin before she leaves London again. If I were you, I would\r\ncertainly get him myself. I had almost forgot to give you my opinion of\r\nMr. De Courcy; I am really delighted with him; he is full as handsome, I\r\nthink, as Mainwaring, and with such an open, good-humoured countenance,\r\nthat one cannot help loving him at first sight. Mr. Johnson and he\r\nare the greatest friends in the world. Adieu, my dearest Susan, I wish\r\nmatters did not go so perversely. That unlucky visit to Langford! but I\r\ndare say you did all for the best, and there is no defying destiny.\r\n\r\nYour sincerely attached\r\n\r\nALICIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY SUSAN TO MRS. JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\nUpper Seymour Street.\r\n\r\nMy dear Alicia,--I yield to the necessity which parts us. Under\r\ncircumstances you could not act otherwise. Our friendship cannot\r\nbe impaired by it, and in happier times, when your situation is as\r\nindependent as mine, it will unite us again in the same intimacy as\r\never. For this I shall impatiently wait, and meanwhile can safely assure\r\nyou that I never was more at ease, or better satisfied with myself and\r\neverything about me than at the present hour. Your husband I abhor,\r\nReginald I despise, and I am secure of never seeing either again. Have\r\nI not reason to rejoice? Mainwaring is more devoted to me than ever; and\r\nwere we at liberty, I doubt if I could resist even matrimony offered by\r\nHIM. This event, if his wife live with you, it may be in your power to\r\nhasten. The violence of her feelings, which must wear her out, may be\r\neasily kept in irritation. I rely on your friendship for this. I am now\r\nsatisfied that I never could have brought myself to marry Reginald, and\r\nam equally determined that Frederica never shall. To-morrow, I shall\r\nfetch her from Churchhill, and let Maria Mainwaring tremble for the\r\nconsequence. Frederica shall be Sir James's wife before she quits my\r\nhouse, and she may whimper, and the Vernons may storm, I regard them\r\nnot. I am tired of submitting my will to the caprices of others; of\r\nresigning my own judgment in deference to those to whom I owe no duty,\r\nand for whom I feel no respect. I have given up too much, have been too\r\neasily worked on, but Frederica shall now feel the difference. Adieu,\r\ndearest of friends; may the next gouty attack be more favourable! and\r\nmay you always regard me as unalterably yours,\r\n\r\nS. VERNON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY DE COURCY TO MRS. VERNON\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Catherine,--I have charming news for you, and if I had not sent\r\noff my letter this morning you might have been spared the vexation of\r\nknowing of Reginald's being gone to London, for he is returned. Reginald\r\nis returned, not to ask our consent to his marrying Lady Susan, but to\r\ntell us they are parted for ever. He has been only an hour in the house,\r\nand I have not been able to learn particulars, for he is so very low\r\nthat I have not the heart to ask questions, but I hope we shall soon\r\nknow all. This is the most joyful hour he has ever given us since the\r\nday of his birth. Nothing is wanting but to have you here, and it is our\r\nparticular wish and entreaty that you would come to us as soon as you\r\ncan. You have owed us a visit many long weeks; I hope nothing will make\r\nit inconvenient to Mr. Vernon; and pray bring all my grand-children; and\r\nyour dear niece is included, of course; I long to see her. It has been\r\na sad, heavy winter hitherto, without Reginald, and seeing nobody from\r\nChurchhill. I never found the season so dreary before; but this happy\r\nmeeting will make us young again. Frederica runs much in my thoughts,\r\nand when Reginald has recovered his usual good spirits (as I trust he\r\nsoon will) we will try to rob him of his heart once more, and I am full\r\nof hopes of seeing their hands joined at no great distance.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate mother,\r\n\r\nC. DE COURCY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. VERNON TO LADY DE COURCY\r\n\r\n\r\nChurchhill.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Mother,--Your letter has surprized me beyond measure! Can it be\r\ntrue that they are really separated--and for ever? I should be overjoyed\r\nif I dared depend on it, but after all that I have seen how can one be\r\nsecure. And Reginald really with you! My surprize is the greater because\r\non Wednesday, the very day of his coming to Parklands, we had a most\r\nunexpected and unwelcome visit from Lady Susan, looking all cheerfulness\r\nand good-humour, and seeming more as if she were to marry him when she\r\ngot to London than as if parted from him for ever. She stayed nearly two\r\nhours, was as affectionate and agreeable as ever, and not a syllable,\r\nnot a hint was dropped, of any disagreement or coolness between them.\r\nI asked her whether she had seen my brother since his arrival in town;\r\nnot, as you may suppose, with any doubt of the fact, but merely to see\r\nhow she looked. She immediately answered, without any embarrassment,\r\nthat he had been kind enough to call on her on Monday; but she believed\r\nhe had already returned home, which I was very far from crediting. Your\r\nkind invitation is accepted by us with pleasure, and on Thursday next we\r\nand our little ones will be with you. Pray heaven, Reginald may not be\r\nin town again by that time! I wish we could bring dear Frederica too,\r\nbut I am sorry to say that her mother's errand hither was to fetch her\r\naway; and, miserable as it made the poor girl, it was impossible to\r\ndetain her. I was thoroughly unwilling to let her go, and so was her\r\nuncle; and all that could be urged we did urge; but Lady Susan declared\r\nthat as she was now about to fix herself in London for several months,\r\nshe could not be easy if her daughter were not with her for masters,\r\n&c. Her manner, to be sure, was very kind and proper, and Mr. Vernon\r\nbelieves that Frederica will now be treated with affection. I wish I\r\ncould think so too. The poor girl's heart was almost broke at taking\r\nleave of us. I charged her to write to me very often, and to remember\r\nthat if she were in any distress we should be always her friends. I took\r\ncare to see her alone, that I might say all this, and I hope made her a\r\nlittle more comfortable; but I shall not be easy till I can go to town\r\nand judge of her situation myself. I wish there were a better prospect\r\nthan now appears of the match which the conclusion of your letter\r\ndeclares your expectations of. At present, it is not very likely,\r\n\r\nYours ever, &c.,\r\n\r\nC. VERNON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThis correspondence, by a meeting between some of the parties, and a\r\nseparation between the others, could not, to the great detriment of the\r\nPost Office revenue, be continued any longer. Very little assistance\r\nto the State could be derived from the epistolary intercourse of Mrs.\r\nVernon and her niece; for the former soon perceived, by the style\r\nof Frederica's letters, that they were written under her mother's\r\ninspection! and therefore, deferring all particular enquiry till she\r\ncould make it personally in London, ceased writing minutely or often.\r\nHaving learnt enough, in the meanwhile, from her open-hearted brother,\r\nof what had passed between him and Lady Susan to sink the latter lower\r\nthan ever in her opinion, she was proportionably more anxious to get\r\nFrederica removed from such a mother, and placed under her own care;\r\nand, though with little hope of success, was resolved to leave nothing\r\nunattempted that might offer a chance of obtaining her sister-in-law's\r\nconsent to it. Her anxiety on the subject made her press for an early\r\nvisit to London; and Mr. Vernon, who, as it must already have appeared,\r\nlived only to do whatever he was desired, soon found some accommodating\r\nbusiness to call him thither. With a heart full of the matter, Mrs.\r\nVernon waited on Lady Susan shortly after her arrival in town, and was\r\nmet with such an easy and cheerful affection, as made her almost turn\r\nfrom her with horror. No remembrance of Reginald, no consciousness of\r\nguilt, gave one look of embarrassment; she was in excellent spirits, and\r\nseemed eager to show at once by ever possible attention to her brother\r\nand sister her sense of their kindness, and her pleasure in their\r\nsociety. Frederica was no more altered than Lady Susan; the same\r\nrestrained manners, the same timid look in the presence of her mother as\r\nheretofore, assured her aunt of her situation being uncomfortable, and\r\nconfirmed her in the plan of altering it. No unkindness, however, on the\r\npart of Lady Susan appeared. Persecution on the subject of Sir James was\r\nentirely at an end; his name merely mentioned to say that he was not in\r\nLondon; and indeed, in all her conversation, she was solicitous only for\r\nthe welfare and improvement of her daughter, acknowledging, in terms of\r\ngrateful delight, that Frederica was now growing every day more and more\r\nwhat a parent could desire. Mrs. Vernon, surprized and incredulous,\r\nknew not what to suspect, and, without any change in her own views,\r\nonly feared greater difficulty in accomplishing them. The first hope\r\nof anything better was derived from Lady Susan's asking her whether she\r\nthought Frederica looked quite as well as she had done at Churchhill, as\r\nshe must confess herself to have sometimes an anxious doubt of London's\r\nperfectly agreeing with her. Mrs. Vernon, encouraging the doubt,\r\ndirectly proposed her niece's returning with them into the country. Lady\r\nSusan was unable to express her sense of such kindness, yet knew not,\r\nfrom a variety of reasons, how to part with her daughter; and as, though\r\nher own plans were not yet wholly fixed, she trusted it would ere long\r\nbe in her power to take Frederica into the country herself, concluded by\r\ndeclining entirely to profit by such unexampled attention. Mrs. Vernon\r\npersevered, however, in the offer of it, and though Lady Susan continued\r\nto resist, her resistance in the course of a few days seemed somewhat\r\nless formidable. The lucky alarm of an influenza decided what might not\r\nhave been decided quite so soon. Lady Susan's maternal fears were then\r\ntoo much awakened for her to think of anything but Frederica's removal\r\nfrom the risk of infection; above all disorders in the world she most\r\ndreaded the influenza for her daughter's constitution!\r\n\r\nFrederica returned to Churchhill with her uncle and aunt; and three\r\nweeks afterwards, Lady Susan announced her being married to Sir James\r\nMartin. Mrs. Vernon was then convinced of what she had only suspected\r\nbefore, that she might have spared herself all the trouble of urging\r\na removal which Lady Susan had doubtless resolved on from the first.\r\nFrederica's visit was nominally for six weeks, but her mother, though\r\ninviting her to return in one or two affectionate letters, was very\r\nready to oblige the whole party by consenting to a prolongation of her\r\nstay, and in the course of two months ceased to write of her absence,\r\nand in the course of two or more to write to her at all. Frederica was\r\ntherefore fixed in the family of her uncle and aunt till such time as\r\nReginald De Courcy could be talked, flattered, and finessed into an\r\naffection for her which, allowing leisure for the conquest of his\r\nattachment to her mother, for his abjuring all future attachments, and\r\ndetesting the sex, might be reasonably looked for in the course of a\r\ntwelvemonth. Three months might have done it in general, but Reginald's\r\nfeelings were no less lasting than lively. Whether Lady Susan was or\r\nwas not happy in her second choice, I do not see how it can ever be\r\nascertained; for who would take her assurance of it on either side of\r\nthe question? The world must judge from probabilities; she had nothing\r\nagainst her but her husband, and her conscience. Sir James may seem to\r\nhave drawn a harder lot than mere folly merited; I leave him, therefore,\r\nto all the pity that anybody can give him. For myself, I confess that I\r\ncan pity only Miss Mainwaring; who, coming to town, and putting herself\r\nto an expense in clothes which impoverished her for two years, on\r\npurpose to secure him, was defrauded of her due by a woman ten years\r\nolder than herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Lady Susan, by Jane Austen\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LADY SUSAN ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 946.txt or 946.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/9/4/946/\r\n\r\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n",

The shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion, or by\r\nguesswork; but painstakingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and\r\nsupport of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech.\r\n\r\nI make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers\r\nwould suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and\r\nnot succeeding.\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUCKLEBERRY FINN\r\n\r\nScene: The Mississippi Valley Time: Forty to fifty years ago\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The\r\nAdventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter. That book was made\r\nby Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things\r\nwhich he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I\r\nnever seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt\r\nPolly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly--Tom's Aunt Polly, she\r\nis--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which\r\nis mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.\r\n\r\nNow the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money\r\nthat the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six\r\nthousand dollars apiece--all gold. It was an awful sight of money when\r\nit was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out\r\nat interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year\r\nround--more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas\r\nshe took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was\r\nrough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular\r\nand decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand\r\nit no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead\r\nagain, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and\r\nsaid he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I\r\nwould go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back.\r\n\r\nThe widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she\r\ncalled me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by\r\nit. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but\r\nsweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing\r\ncommenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come\r\nto time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but\r\nyou had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little\r\nover the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with\r\nthem,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself. In a\r\nbarrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the\r\njuice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.\r\n\r\nAfter supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the\r\nBulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and\r\nby she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so\r\nthen I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in\r\ndead people.\r\n\r\nPretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she\r\nwouldn't. She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must\r\ntry to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They\r\nget down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it. Here she was\r\na-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,\r\nbeing gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a\r\nthing that had some good in it. And she took snuff, too; of course that\r\nwas all right, because she done it herself.\r\n\r\nHer sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,\r\nhad just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a\r\nspelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then\r\nthe widow made her ease up. I couldn't stood it much longer. Then for\r\nan hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say,\r\n\u201cDon't put your feet up there, Huckleberry;\u201d and \u201cDon't scrunch up\r\nlike that, Huckleberry--set up straight;\u201d and pretty soon she would\r\nsay, \u201cDon't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don't you try to\r\nbehave?\u201d Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished\r\nI was there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm. All I wanted\r\nwas to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular.\r\nShe said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for\r\nthe whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.\r\nWell, I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I\r\nmade up my mind I wouldn't try for it. But I never said so, because it\r\nwould only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.\r\n\r\nNow she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good\r\nplace. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all\r\nday long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn't think\r\nmuch of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer\r\nwould go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad\r\nabout that, because I wanted him and me to be together.\r\n\r\nMiss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.\r\nBy and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then\r\neverybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle,\r\nand put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and\r\ntried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use. I felt\r\nso lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the\r\nleaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away\r\noff, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a\r\ndog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying\r\nto whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so\r\nit made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard\r\nthat kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about\r\nsomething that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so\r\ncan't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night\r\ngrieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some\r\ncompany. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I\r\nflipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it\r\nwas all shriveled up. I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was\r\nan awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared\r\nand most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my\r\ntracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied\r\nup a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But\r\nI hadn't no confidence. You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that\r\nyou've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever\r\nheard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed\r\na spider.\r\n\r\nI set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;\r\nfor the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't\r\nknow. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town\r\ngo boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than\r\never. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the\r\ntrees--something was a stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I\r\ncould just barely hear a \u201cme-yow! me-yow!\u201d down there. That was good!\r\nSays I, \u201cme-yow! me-yow!\u201d as soft as I could, and then I put out the\r\nlight and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped\r\ndown to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,\r\nthere was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of\r\nthe widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our\r\nheads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made\r\na noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson's big nigger,\r\nnamed Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty\r\nclear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and stretched\r\nhis neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWho dah?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right\r\nbetween us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was\r\nminutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so close\r\ntogether. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I\r\ndasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,\r\nright between my shoulders. Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch.\r\nWell, I've noticed that thing plenty times since. If you are with\r\nthe quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't\r\nsleepy--if you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why\r\nyou will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn' hear sumf'n.\r\nWell, I know what I's gwyne to do: I's gwyne to set down here and\r\nlisten tell I hears it agin.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up\r\nagainst a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched\r\none of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears come into\r\nmy eyes. But I dasn't scratch. Then it begun to itch on the inside.\r\nNext I got to itching underneath. I didn't know how I was going to set\r\nstill. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but\r\nit seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in eleven different\r\nplaces now. I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer,\r\nbut I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then Jim begun\r\nto breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon\r\ncomfortable again.\r\n\r\nTom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we\r\nwent creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off Tom\r\nwhispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I said\r\nno; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out I\r\nwarn't in. Then Tom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip\r\nin the kitchen and get some more. I didn't want him to try. I said Jim\r\nmight wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there\r\nand got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.\r\nThen we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do\r\nTom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play\r\nsomething on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was\r\nso still and lonesome.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,\r\nand by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of\r\nthe house. Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it\r\non a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn't wake.\r\nAfterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,\r\nand rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,\r\nand hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time Jim told\r\nit he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every\r\ntime he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they\r\nrode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back\r\nwas all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he\r\ngot so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come\r\nmiles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any\r\nnigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their mouths\r\nopen and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers is\r\nalways talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but\r\nwhenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things,\r\nJim would happen in and say, \u201cHm! What you know 'bout witches?\u201d and\r\nthat nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. Jim always kept\r\nthat five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a\r\ncharm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could\r\ncure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by\r\nsaying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it.\r\nNiggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they\r\nhad, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch\r\nit, because the devil had had his hands on it. Jim was most ruined for\r\na servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil\r\nand been rode by witches.\r\n\r\nWell, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down\r\ninto the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where\r\nthere was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever\r\nso fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and\r\nawful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and\r\nBen Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.\r\nSo we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half,\r\nto the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.\r\n\r\nWe went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the\r\nsecret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest\r\npart of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our\r\nhands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave\r\nopened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked\r\nunder a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole. We\r\nwent along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and\r\nsweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang.\r\nEverybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name\r\nin blood.\u201d\r\n\r\nEverybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had\r\nwrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the\r\nband, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to\r\nany boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and\r\nhis family must do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he\r\nhad killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign\r\nof the band. And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that\r\nmark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be\r\nkilled. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he\r\nmust have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the\r\nashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with\r\nblood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it\r\nand be forgot forever.\r\n\r\nEverybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got\r\nit out of his own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was out of\r\npirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSome thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told\r\nthe secrets. Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote\r\nit in. Then Ben Rogers says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHere's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; what you going to do 'bout\r\nhim?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, hain't he got a father?\u201d says Tom Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him these days. He\r\nused to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain't been seen\r\nin these parts for a year or more.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they\r\nsaid every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it\r\nwouldn't be fair and square for the others. Well, nobody could think of\r\nanything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still. I was most ready\r\nto cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss\r\nWatson--they could kill her. Everybody said:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, she'll do. That's all right. Huck can come in.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,\r\nand I made my mark on the paper.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d says Ben Rogers, \u201cwhat's the line of business of this Gang?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing only robbery and murder,\u201d Tom said.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery; it's burglary,\u201d\r\n says Tom Sawyer.  \u201cWe ain't burglars. That ain't no sort of style. We\r\nare highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks\r\non, and kill the people and take their watches and money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMust we always kill the people?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, certainly. It's best. Some authorities think different, but\r\nmostly it's considered best to kill them--except some that you bring to\r\nthe cave here, and keep them till they're ransomed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRansomed? What's that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't know. But that's what they do. I've seen it in books; and so\r\nof course that's what we've got to do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how can we do it if we don't know what it is?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, blame it all, we've _got_ to do it. Don't I tell you it's in the\r\nbooks? Do you want to go to doing different from what's in the books,\r\nand get things all muddled up?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that's all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation\r\nare these fellows going to be ransomed if we don't know how to do it\r\nto them?--that's the thing I want to get at. Now, what do you reckon it\r\nis?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don't know. But per'aps if we keep them till they're ransomed,\r\nit means that we keep them till they're dead.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, that's something _like_. That'll answer. Why couldn't you said\r\nthat before? We'll keep them till they're ransomed to death; and a\r\nbothersome lot they'll be, too--eating up everything, and always trying\r\nto get loose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when there's a guard\r\nover them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA guard! Well, that _is_ good. So somebody's got to set up all night\r\nand never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. I think that's\r\nfoolishness. Why can't a body take a club and ransom them as soon as\r\nthey get here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause it ain't in the books so--that's why. Now, Ben Rogers, do you\r\nwant to do things regular, or don't you?--that's the idea. Don't you\r\nreckon that the people that made the books knows what's the correct\r\nthing to do? Do you reckon _you_ can learn 'em anything? Not by a good\r\ndeal. No, sir, we'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right. I don't mind; but I say it's a fool way, anyhow. Say, do\r\nwe kill the women, too?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn't let on. Kill\r\nthe women? No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that. You\r\nfetch them to the cave, and you're always as polite as pie to them;\r\nand by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any\r\nmore.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, if that's the way I'm agreed, but I don't take no stock in it.\r\nMighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows\r\nwaiting to be ransomed, that there won't be no place for the robbers.\r\nBut go ahead, I ain't got nothing to say.\u201d\r\n\r\nLittle Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was\r\nscared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn't\r\nwant to be a robber any more.\r\n\r\nSo they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him\r\nmad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets. But\r\nTom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and\r\nmeet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.\r\n\r\nBen Rogers said he couldn't get out much, only Sundays, and so he wanted\r\nto begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it\r\non Sunday, and that settled the thing. They agreed to get together and\r\nfix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer first\r\ncaptain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started home.\r\n\r\nI clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was\r\nbreaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was\r\ndog-tired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on\r\naccount of my clothes; but the widow she didn't scold, but only cleaned\r\noff the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would\r\nbehave awhile if I could. Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet\r\nand prayed, but nothing come of it. She told me to pray every day, and\r\nwhatever I asked for I would get it. But it warn't so. I tried it.\r\nOnce I got a fish-line, but no hooks. It warn't any good to me without\r\nhooks. I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I\r\ncouldn't make it work. By and by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to\r\ntry for me, but she said I was a fool. She never told me why, and I\r\ncouldn't make it out no way.\r\n\r\nI set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it.\r\nI says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don't\r\nDeacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork? Why can't the widow get\r\nback her silver snuffbox that was stole? Why can't Miss Watson fat up?\r\nNo, says I to my self, there ain't nothing in it. I went and told the\r\nwidow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for\r\nit was \u201cspiritual gifts.\u201d This was too many for me, but she told me\r\nwhat she meant--I must help other people, and do everything I could for\r\nother people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about\r\nmyself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it. I went out in the\r\nwoods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn't see no\r\nadvantage about it--except for the other people; so at last I reckoned\r\nI wouldn't worry about it any more, but just let it go. Sometimes the\r\nwidow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make\r\na body's mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold\r\nand knock it all down again. I judged I could see that there was two\r\nProvidences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the\r\nwidow's Providence, but if Miss Watson's got him there warn't no help\r\nfor him any more. I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong\r\nto the widow's if he wanted me, though I couldn't make out how he was\r\na-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was\r\nso ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.\r\n\r\nPap he hadn't been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable\r\nfor me; I didn't want to see him no more. He used to always whale me\r\nwhen he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to take\r\nto the woods most of the time when he was around. Well, about this time\r\nhe was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so\r\npeople said. They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man was\r\njust his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all\r\nlike pap; but they couldn't make nothing out of the face, because it had\r\nbeen in the water so long it warn't much like a face at all. They said\r\nhe was floating on his back in the water. They took him and buried him\r\non the bank. But I warn't comfortable long, because I happened to think\r\nof something. I knowed mighty well that a drownded man don't float on\r\nhis back, but on his face. So I knowed, then, that this warn't pap, but\r\na woman dressed up in a man's clothes. So I was uncomfortable again.\r\nI judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished he\r\nwouldn't.\r\n\r\nWe played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned. All\r\nthe boys did. We hadn't robbed nobody, hadn't killed any people, but\r\nonly just pretended. We used to hop out of the woods and go charging\r\ndown on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market,\r\nbut we never hived any of them. Tom Sawyer called the hogs \u201cingots,\u201d\r\n and he called the turnips and stuff \u201cjulery,\u201d and we would go to the\r\ncave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed\r\nand marked. But I couldn't see no profit in it. One time Tom sent a\r\nboy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan\r\n(which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he\r\nhad got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish\r\nmerchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two\r\nhundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand \u201csumter\u201d\r\n mules, all loaded down with di'monds, and they didn't have only a guard\r\nof four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called\r\nit, and kill the lot and scoop the things. He said we must slick up\r\nour swords and guns, and get ready. He never could go after even a\r\nturnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it,\r\nthough they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them\r\ntill you rotted, and then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashes more\r\nthan what they was before. I didn't believe we could lick such a crowd\r\nof Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants,\r\nso I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got\r\nthe word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill. But there warn't\r\nno Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn't no camels nor no elephants.\r\nIt warn't anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class\r\nat that. We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we\r\nnever got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got\r\na rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the\r\nteacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.\r\n\r\nI didn't see no di'monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so. He said there was\r\nloads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too,\r\nand elephants and things. I said, why couldn't we see them, then? He\r\nsaid if I warn't so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I\r\nwould know without asking. He said it was all done by enchantment. He\r\nsaid there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure,\r\nand so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had\r\nturned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite.\r\nI said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for the\r\nmagicians. Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said he, \u201ca magician could call up a lot of genies, and they\r\nwould hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson. They\r\nare as tall as a tree and as big around as a church.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I says, \u201cs'pose we got some genies to help _us_--can't we lick\r\nthe other crowd then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow you going to get them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't know. How do _they_ get them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies\r\ncome tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the\r\nsmoke a-rolling, and everything they're told to do they up and do it.\r\nThey don't think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots, and\r\nbelting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it--or any\r\nother man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho makes them tear around so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring. They belong to whoever rubs\r\nthe lamp or the ring, and they've got to do whatever he says. If he\r\ntells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di'monds, and fill\r\nit full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor's\r\ndaughter from China for you to marry, they've got to do it--and they've\r\ngot to do it before sun-up next morning, too. And more: they've got\r\nto waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it, you\r\nunderstand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d says I, \u201cI think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping\r\nthe palace themselves 'stead of fooling them away like that. And what's\r\nmore--if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would\r\ndrop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow you talk, Huck Finn. Why, you'd _have_ to come when he rubbed it,\r\nwhether you wanted to or not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church? All right, then;\r\nI _would_ come; but I lay I'd make that man climb the highest tree there\r\nwas in the country.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShucks, it ain't no use to talk to you, Huck Finn. You don't seem to\r\nknow anything, somehow--perfect saphead.\u201d\r\n\r\nI thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I\r\nwould see if there was anything in it. I got an old tin lamp and an\r\niron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat\r\nlike an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn't\r\nno use, none of the genies come. So then I judged that all that stuff\r\nwas only just one of Tom Sawyer's lies. I reckoned he believed in the\r\nA-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different. It had all\r\nthe marks of a Sunday-school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter\r\nnow. I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and\r\nwrite just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six\r\ntimes seven is thirty-five, and I don't reckon I could ever get any\r\nfurther than that if I was to live forever. I don't take no stock in\r\nmathematics, anyway.\r\n\r\nAt first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it.\r\nWhenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next\r\nday done me good and cheered me up. So the longer I went to school the\r\neasier it got to be. I was getting sort of used to the widow's ways,\r\ntoo, and they warn't so raspy on me. Living in a house and sleeping in\r\na bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather I\r\nused to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a\r\nrest to me. I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the\r\nnew ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along slow but\r\nsure, and doing very satisfactory. She said she warn't ashamed of me.\r\n\r\nOne morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast.\r\nI reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left\r\nshoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me,\r\nand crossed me off. She says, \u201cTake your hands away, Huckleberry; what\r\na mess you are always making!\u201d The widow put in a good word for me, but\r\nthat warn't going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough.\r\nI started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and\r\nwondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be.\r\nThere is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn't one\r\nof them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along\r\nlow-spirited and on the watch-out.\r\n\r\nI went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go\r\nthrough the high board fence. There was an inch of new snow on the\r\nground, and I seen somebody's tracks. They had come up from the quarry\r\nand stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the garden\r\nfence. It was funny they hadn't come in, after standing around so. I\r\ncouldn't make it out. It was very curious, somehow. I was going to\r\nfollow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first. I didn't\r\nnotice anything at first, but next I did. There was a cross in the left\r\nboot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil.\r\n\r\nI was up in a second and shinning down the hill. I looked over my\r\nshoulder every now and then, but I didn't see nobody. I was at Judge\r\nThatcher's as quick as I could get there. He said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, my boy, you are all out of breath. Did you come for your\r\ninterest?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d I says; \u201cis there some for me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night--over a hundred and fifty\r\ndollars. Quite a fortune for you. You had better let me invest it\r\nalong with your six thousand, because if you take it you'll spend it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d I says, \u201cI don't want to spend it. I don't want it at\r\nall--nor the six thousand, nuther. I want you to take it; I want to give\r\nit to you--the six thousand and all.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked surprised. He couldn't seem to make it out. He says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what can you mean, my boy?\u201d\r\n\r\nI says, \u201cDon't you ask me no questions about it, please. You'll take\r\nit--won't you?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I'm puzzled. Is something the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease take it,\u201d says I, \u201cand don't ask me nothing--then I won't have to\r\ntell no lies.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe studied a while, and then he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cOho-o! I think I see. You want to _sell_ all your property to me--not\r\ngive it. That's the correct idea.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cThere; you see it says 'for a consideration.' That means I have bought\r\nit of you and paid you for it. Here's a dollar for you. Now you sign\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo I signed it, and left.\r\n\r\nMiss Watson's nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which\r\nhad been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do\r\nmagic with it. He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed\r\neverything. So I went to him that night and told him pap was here\r\nagain, for I found his tracks in the snow. What I wanted to know was,\r\nwhat he was going to do, and was he going to stay? Jim got out his\r\nhair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and dropped\r\nit on the floor. It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch.\r\nJim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same.\r\nJim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and listened.\r\nBut it warn't no use; he said it wouldn't talk. He said sometimes it\r\nwouldn't talk without money. I told him I had an old slick counterfeit\r\nquarter that warn't no good because the brass showed through the silver\r\na little, and it wouldn't pass nohow, even if the brass didn't show,\r\nbecause it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it\r\nevery time. (I reckoned I wouldn't say nothing about the dollar I got\r\nfrom the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball\r\nwould take it, because maybe it wouldn't know the difference. Jim smelt\r\nit and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball\r\nwould think it was good. He said he would split open a raw Irish potato\r\nand stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next\r\nmorning you couldn't see no brass, and it wouldn't feel greasy no more,\r\nand so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball.\r\nWell, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it.\r\n\r\nJim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened\r\nagain. This time he said the hair-ball was all right. He said it\r\nwould tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to. I says, go on. So the\r\nhair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me. He says:\r\n\r\n\u201cYo' ole father doan' know yit what he's a-gwyne to do. Sometimes he\r\nspec he'll go 'way, en den agin he spec he'll stay. De bes' way is to\r\nres' easy en let de ole man take his own way. Dey's two angels hoverin'\r\nroun' 'bout him. One uv 'em is white en shiny, en t'other one is black.\r\nDe white one gits him to go right a little while, den de black one sail\r\nin en bust it all up. A body can't tell yit which one gwyne to fetch\r\nhim at de las'. But you is all right. You gwyne to have considable\r\ntrouble in yo' life, en considable joy. Sometimes you gwyne to git\r\nhurt, en sometimes you gwyne to git sick; but every time you's gwyne\r\nto git well agin. Dey's two gals flyin' 'bout you in yo' life. One\r\nuv 'em's light en t'other one is dark. One is rich en t'other is po'.\r\nYou's gwyne to marry de po' one fust en de rich one by en by. You\r\nwants to keep 'way fum de water as much as you kin, en don't run no\r\nresk, 'kase it's down in de bills dat you's gwyne to git hung.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap his\r\nown self!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had shut the door to. Then I turned around and there he was. I used\r\nto be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much. I reckoned I\r\nwas scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was mistaken--that is, after\r\nthe first jolt, as you may say, when my breath sort of hitched, he being\r\nso unexpected; but right away after I see I warn't scared of him worth\r\nbothring about.\r\n\r\nHe was most fifty, and he looked it. His hair was long and tangled and\r\ngreasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through\r\nlike he was behind vines. It was all black, no gray; so was his long,\r\nmixed-up whiskers. There warn't no color in his face, where his face\r\nshowed; it was white; not like another man's white, but a white to make\r\na body sick, a white to make a body's flesh crawl--a tree-toad white, a\r\nfish-belly white. As for his clothes--just rags, that was all. He had\r\none ankle resting on t'other knee; the boot on that foot was busted, and\r\ntwo of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now and then. His hat\r\nwas laying on the floor--an old black slouch with the top caved in, like\r\na lid.\r\n\r\nI stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chair\r\ntilted back a little. I set the candle down. I noticed the window was\r\nup; so he had clumb in by the shed. He kept a-looking me all over. By\r\nand by he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cStarchy clothes--very. You think you're a good deal of a big-bug,\r\n_don't_ you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe I am, maybe I ain't,\u201d I says.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon't you give me none o' your lip,\u201d says he.  \u201cYou've put on\r\nconsiderable many frills since I been away. I'll take you down a peg\r\nbefore I get done with you. You're educated, too, they say--can read and\r\nwrite. You think you're better'n your father, now, don't you, because\r\nhe can't? _I'll_ take it out of you. Who told you you might meddle\r\nwith such hifalut'n foolishness, hey?--who told you you could?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe widow. She told me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe widow, hey?--and who told the widow she could put in her shovel\r\nabout a thing that ain't none of her business?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNobody never told her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I'll learn her how to meddle. And looky here--you drop that\r\nschool, you hear? I'll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs\r\nover his own father and let on to be better'n what _he_ is. You lemme\r\ncatch you fooling around that school again, you hear? Your mother\r\ncouldn't read, and she couldn't write, nuther, before she died. None\r\nof the family couldn't before _they_ died. I can't; and here you're\r\na-swelling yourself up like this. I ain't the man to stand it--you hear?\r\nSay, lemme hear you read.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the\r\nwars. When I'd read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a whack\r\nwith his hand and knocked it across the house. He says:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's so. You can do it. I had my doubts when you told me. Now looky\r\nhere; you stop that putting on frills. I won't have it. I'll lay for\r\nyou, my smarty; and if I catch you about that school I'll tan you good.\r\nFirst you know you'll get religion, too. I never see such a son.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat's this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's something they give me for learning my lessons good.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe tore it up, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI'll give you something better--I'll give you a cowhide.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:\r\n\r\n\u201c_Ain't_ you a sweet-scented dandy, though? A bed; and bedclothes; and\r\na look'n'-glass; and a piece of carpet on the floor--and your own father\r\ngot to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard. I never see such a son. I\r\nbet I'll take some o' these frills out o' you before I'm done with you.\r\nWhy, there ain't no end to your airs--they say you're rich. Hey?--how's\r\nthat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey lie--that's how.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLooky here--mind how you talk to me; I'm a-standing about all I can\r\nstand now--so don't gimme no sass. I've been in town two days, and I\r\nhain't heard nothing but about you bein' rich. I heard about it\r\naway down the river, too. That's why I come. You git me that money\r\nto-morrow--I want it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hain't got no money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's a lie. Judge Thatcher's got it. You git it. I want it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hain't got no money, I tell you. You ask Judge Thatcher; he'll tell\r\nyou the same.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right. I'll ask him; and I'll make him pungle, too, or I'll know\r\nthe reason why. Say, how much you got in your pocket? I want it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hain't got only a dollar, and I want that to--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt don't make no difference what you want it for--you just shell it\r\nout.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was\r\ngoing down town to get some whisky; said he hadn't had a drink all day.\r\nWhen he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed\r\nme for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I\r\nreckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me\r\nto mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick\r\nme if I didn't drop that.\r\n\r\nNext day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher's and bullyragged\r\nhim, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn't, and then\r\nhe swore he'd make the law force him.\r\n\r\nThe judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away\r\nfrom him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that\r\nhad just come, and he didn't know the old man; so he said courts mustn't\r\ninterfere and separate families if they could help it; said he'd druther\r\nnot take a child away from its father. So Judge Thatcher and the widow\r\nhad to quit on the business.\r\n\r\nThat pleased the old man till he couldn't rest. He said he'd cowhide\r\nme till I was black and blue if I didn't raise some money for him. I\r\nborrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and got\r\ndrunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying\r\non; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight;\r\nthen they jailed him, and next day they had him before court, and jailed\r\nhim again for a week. But he said _he_ was satisfied; said he was boss\r\nof his son, and he'd make it warm for _him_.\r\n\r\nWhen he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him.\r\nSo he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and\r\nhad him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just\r\nold pie to him, so to speak. And after supper he talked to him about\r\ntemperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he'd been\r\na fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn over\r\na new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn't be ashamed of, and he hoped the\r\njudge would help him and not look down on him. The judge said he could\r\nhug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again; pap\r\nsaid he'd been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the\r\njudge said he believed it. The old man said that what a man wanted\r\nthat was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they cried\r\nagain. And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his\r\nhand, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it.\r\nThere's a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain't so no more; it's\r\nthe hand of a man that's started in on a new life, and'll die before\r\nhe'll go back. You mark them words--don't forget I said them. It's a\r\nclean hand now; shake it--don't be afeard.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried. The\r\njudge's wife she kissed it. Then the old man he signed a pledge--made\r\nhis mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on record, or something\r\nlike that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which was\r\nthe spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and\r\nclumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his\r\nnew coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old\r\ntime; and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and\r\nrolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was most\r\nfroze to death when somebody found him after sun-up. And when they come\r\nto look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could\r\nnavigate it.\r\n\r\nThe judge he felt kind of sore. He said he reckoned a body could reform\r\nthe old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn't know no other way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went\r\nfor Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he\r\nwent for me, too, for not stopping school. He catched me a couple of\r\ntimes and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged\r\nhim or outrun him most of the time. I didn't want to go to school much\r\nbefore, but I reckoned I'd go now to spite pap. That law trial was a\r\nslow business--appeared like they warn't ever going to get started on it;\r\nso every now and then I'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge\r\nfor him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. Every time he got money he\r\ngot drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and\r\nevery time he raised Cain he got jailed. He was just suited--this kind\r\nof thing was right in his line.\r\n\r\nHe got to hanging around the widow's too much and so she told him at\r\nlast that if he didn't quit using around there she would make trouble\r\nfor him. Well, _wasn't_ he mad? He said he would show who was Huck\r\nFinn's boss. So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and\r\ncatched me, and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, and\r\ncrossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn't\r\nno houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick\r\nyou couldn't find it if you didn't know where it was.\r\n\r\nHe kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off.\r\nWe lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the\r\nkey under his head nights. He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon,\r\nand we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. Every little\r\nwhile he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the\r\nferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got\r\ndrunk and had a good time, and licked me. The widow she found out where\r\nI was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but\r\npap drove him off with the gun, and it warn't long after that till I was\r\nused to being where I was, and liked it--all but the cowhide part.\r\n\r\nIt was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking\r\nand fishing, and no books nor study. Two months or more run along, and\r\nmy clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn't see how I'd ever\r\ngot to like it so well at the widow's, where you had to wash, and eat on\r\na plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever\r\nbothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the\r\ntime. I didn't want to go back no more. I had stopped cussing, because\r\nthe widow didn't like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn't\r\nno objections. It was pretty good times up in the woods there, take it\r\nall around.\r\n\r\nBut by and by pap got too handy with his hick'ry, and I couldn't stand\r\nit. I was all over welts. He got to going away so much, too, and\r\nlocking me in. Once he locked me in and was gone three days. It was\r\ndreadful lonesome. I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn't ever\r\ngoing to get out any more. I was scared. I made up my mind I would fix\r\nup some way to leave there. I had tried to get out of that cabin many\r\na time, but I couldn't find no way. There warn't a window to it big\r\nenough for a dog to get through. I couldn't get up the chimbly; it\r\nwas too narrow. The door was thick, solid oak slabs. Pap was pretty\r\ncareful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away;\r\nI reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I\r\nwas most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in\r\nthe time. But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty\r\nwood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the\r\nclapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work. There was an\r\nold horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin\r\nbehind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and\r\nputting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the blanket,\r\nand went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out--big enough\r\nto let me through. Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting\r\ntowards the end of it when I heard pap's gun in the woods. I got rid of\r\nthe signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty\r\nsoon pap come in.\r\n\r\nPap warn't in a good humor--so he was his natural self. He said he was\r\ndown town, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer said he reckoned\r\nhe would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on\r\nthe trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge\r\nThatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there'd be\r\nanother trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my\r\nguardian, and they guessed it would win this time. This shook me up\r\nconsiderable, because I didn't want to go back to the widow's any more\r\nand be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it. Then the old man\r\ngot to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of,\r\nand then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn't skipped any,\r\nand after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round,\r\nincluding a considerable parcel of people which he didn't know the names\r\nof, and so called them what's-his-name when he got to them, and went\r\nright along with his cussing.\r\n\r\nHe said he would like to see the widow get me. He said he would watch\r\nout, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place\r\nsix or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they\r\ndropped and they couldn't find me. That made me pretty uneasy again,\r\nbut only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn't stay on hand till he got\r\nthat chance.\r\n\r\nThe old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had\r\ngot. There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon,\r\nammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two\r\nnewspapers for wadding, besides some tow. I toted up a load, and went\r\nback and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all\r\nover, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and\r\ntake to the woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn't stay in one\r\nplace, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and\r\nhunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor\r\nthe widow couldn't ever find me any more. I judged I would saw out and\r\nleave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would. I\r\ngot so full of it I didn't notice how long I was staying till the old\r\nman hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.\r\n\r\nI got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. While\r\nI was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of\r\nwarmed up, and went to ripping again. He had been drunk over in town,\r\nand laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at. A body\r\nwould a thought he was Adam--he was just all mud. Whenever his liquor\r\nbegun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cCall this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it's like.\r\nHere's the law a-standing ready to take a man's son away from him--a\r\nman's own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety\r\nand all the expense of raising. Yes, just as that man has got that\r\nson raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin' for\r\n_him_ and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him. And they call\r\n_that_ govment! That ain't all, nuther. The law backs that old Judge\r\nThatcher up and helps him to keep me out o' my property. Here's what\r\nthe law does: The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and\r\nup'ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets\r\nhim go round in clothes that ain't fitten for a hog. They call that\r\ngovment! A man can't get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes\r\nI've a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes,\r\nand I _told_ 'em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face. Lots of 'em\r\nheard me, and can tell what I said. Says I, for two cents I'd leave the\r\nblamed country and never come a-near it agin. Them's the very words. I\r\nsays look at my hat--if you call it a hat--but the lid raises up and the\r\nrest of it goes down till it's below my chin, and then it ain't rightly\r\na hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o'\r\nstove-pipe. Look at it, says I--such a hat for me to wear--one of the\r\nwealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky here.\r\nThere was a free nigger there from Ohio--a mulatter, most as white as\r\na white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the\r\nshiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine\r\nclothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a\r\nsilver-headed cane--the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State. And\r\nwhat do you think? They said he was a p'fessor in a college, and could\r\ntalk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. And that ain't the\r\nwust. They said he could _vote_ when he was at home. Well, that let me\r\nout. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to? It was 'lection day,\r\nand I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn't too drunk to get\r\nthere; but when they told me there was a State in this country where\r\nthey'd let that nigger vote, I drawed out. I says I'll never vote agin.\r\nThem's the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may\r\nrot for all me--I'll never vote agin as long as I live. And to see the\r\ncool way of that nigger--why, he wouldn't a give me the road if I hadn't\r\nshoved him out o' the way. I says to the people, why ain't this nigger\r\nput up at auction and sold?--that's what I want to know. And what do you\r\nreckon they said? Why, they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in\r\nthe State six months, and he hadn't been there that long yet. There,\r\nnow--that's a specimen. They call that a govment that can't sell a free\r\nnigger till he's been in the State six months. Here's a govment that\r\ncalls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a\r\ngovment, and yet's got to set stock-still for six whole months before\r\nit can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free\r\nnigger, and--\u201d\r\n\r\nPap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was\r\ntaking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and\r\nbarked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind\r\nof language--mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give\r\nthe tub some, too, all along, here and there. He hopped around the\r\ncabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding\r\nfirst one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his\r\nleft foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. But it\r\nwarn't good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his\r\ntoes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that\r\nfairly made a body's hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and\r\nrolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over\r\nanything he had ever done previous. He said so his own self afterwards.\r\nHe had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid\r\nover him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.\r\n\r\nAfter supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there\r\nfor two drunks and one delirium tremens. That was always his word. I\r\njudged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal\r\nthe key, or saw myself out, one or t'other. He drank and drank, and\r\ntumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn't run my way.\r\nHe didn't go sound asleep, but was uneasy. He groaned and moaned and\r\nthrashed around this way and that for a long time. At last I got so\r\nsleepy I couldn't keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I\r\nknowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.\r\n\r\nI don't know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an\r\nawful scream and I was up. There was pap looking wild, and skipping\r\naround every which way and yelling about snakes. He said they was\r\ncrawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say\r\none had bit him on the cheek--but I couldn't see no snakes. He started\r\nand run round and round the cabin, hollering \u201cTake him off! take him\r\noff! he's biting me on the neck!\u201d I never see a man look so wild in the\r\neyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he\r\nrolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way,\r\nand striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and\r\nsaying there was devils a-hold of him. He wore out by and by, and laid\r\nstill a while, moaning. Then he laid stiller, and didn't make a sound.\r\nI could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it\r\nseemed terrible still. He was laying over by the corner. By and by he\r\nraised up part way and listened, with his head to one side. He says,\r\nvery low:\r\n\r\n\u201cTramp--tramp--tramp; that's the dead; tramp--tramp--tramp; they're coming\r\nafter me; but I won't go. Oh, they're here! don't touch me--don't! hands\r\noff--they're cold; let go. Oh, let a poor devil alone!\u201d\r\n\r\nThen he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him\r\nalone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the\r\nold pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. I could\r\nhear him through the blanket.\r\n\r\nBy and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he\r\nsee me and went for me. He chased me round and round the place with a\r\nclasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me,\r\nand then I couldn't come for him no more. I begged, and told him I\r\nwas only Huck; but he laughed _such_ a screechy laugh, and roared and\r\ncussed, and kept on chasing me up. Once when I turned short and\r\ndodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my\r\nshoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick\r\nas lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and\r\ndropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a\r\nminute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would\r\nsleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.\r\n\r\nSo he dozed off pretty soon. By and by I got the old split-bottom chair\r\nand clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down the\r\ngun. I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, then I\r\nlaid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down\r\nbehind it to wait for him to stir. And how slow and still the time did\r\ndrag along.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cGit up! What you 'bout?\u201d\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was. It\r\nwas after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep. Pap was standing over me\r\nlooking sour and sick, too. He says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat you doin' with this gun?\u201d\r\n\r\nI judged he didn't know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cSomebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy didn't you roust me out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I tried to, but I couldn't; I couldn't budge you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, all right. Don't stand there palavering all day, but out with\r\nyou and see if there's a fish on the lines for breakfast. I'll be along\r\nin a minute.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank. I noticed\r\nsome pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of\r\nbark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise. I reckoned I would have\r\ngreat times now if I was over at the town. The June rise used to be\r\nalways luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes\r\ncordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts--sometimes a dozen logs\r\ntogether; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the\r\nwood-yards and the sawmill.\r\n\r\nI went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t'other one out\r\nfor what the rise might fetch along. Well, all at once here comes a\r\ncanoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding\r\nhigh like a duck. I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog,\r\nclothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. I just expected\r\nthere'd be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that\r\nto fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd\r\nraise up and laugh at him. But it warn't so this time. It was a\r\ndrift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore. Thinks\r\nI, the old man will be glad when he sees this--she's worth ten dollars.\r\nBut when I got to shore pap wasn't in sight yet, and as I was running\r\nher into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and\r\nwillows, I struck another idea: I judged I'd hide her good, and then,\r\n'stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I'd go down the river\r\nabout fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a\r\nrough time tramping on foot.\r\n\r\nIt was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man\r\ncoming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around\r\na bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just\r\ndrawing a bead on a bird with his gun. So he hadn't seen anything.\r\n\r\nWhen he got along I was hard at it taking up a \u201ctrot\u201d line. He abused\r\nme a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and\r\nthat was what made me so long. I knowed he would see I was wet, and\r\nthen he would be asking questions. We got five catfish off the lines\r\nand went home.\r\n\r\nWhile we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about\r\nwore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap\r\nand the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing\r\nthan trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you\r\nsee, all kinds of things might happen. Well, I didn't see no way for a\r\nwhile, but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of\r\nwater, and he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cAnother time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you\r\nhear? That man warn't here for no good. I'd a shot him. Next time you\r\nroust me out, you hear?\u201d\r\n\r\nThen he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had been\r\nsaying give me the very idea I wanted. I says to myself, I can fix it\r\nnow so nobody won't think of following me.\r\n\r\nAbout twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank. The\r\nriver was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the\r\nrise. By and by along comes part of a log raft--nine logs fast together.\r\nWe went out with the skiff and towed it ashore. Then we had dinner.\r\nAnybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch\r\nmore stuff; but that warn't pap's style. Nine logs was enough for one\r\ntime; he must shove right over to town and sell. So he locked me in and\r\ntook the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three.\r\nI judged he wouldn't come back that night. I waited till I reckoned he\r\nhad got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that\r\nlog again. Before he was t'other side of the river I was out of the\r\nhole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.\r\n\r\nI took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and\r\nshoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same\r\nwith the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug. I took all the coffee and\r\nsugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the\r\nbucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two\r\nblankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot. I took fish-lines and\r\nmatches and other things--everything that was worth a cent. I cleaned\r\nout the place. I wanted an axe, but there wasn't any, only the one out\r\nat the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that. I fetched\r\nout the gun, and now I was done.\r\n\r\nI had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging\r\nout so many things. So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside\r\nby scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the\r\nsawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two\r\nrocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up\r\nat that place and didn't quite touch ground. If you stood four or five\r\nfoot away and didn't know it was sawed, you wouldn't never notice\r\nit; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn't likely\r\nanybody would go fooling around there.\r\n\r\nIt was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn't left a track. I\r\nfollowed around to see. I stood on the bank and looked out over the\r\nriver. All safe. So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,\r\nand was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon\r\nwent wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie\r\nfarms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.\r\n\r\nI took the axe and smashed in the door. I beat it and hacked it\r\nconsiderable a-doing it. I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly\r\nto the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down\r\non the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground--hard packed,\r\nand no boards. Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks\r\nin it--all I could drag--and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to\r\nthe door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and\r\ndown it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see that something had been\r\ndragged over the ground. I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he\r\nwould take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy\r\ntouches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nWell, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and\r\nstuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. Then I\r\ntook up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn't\r\ndrip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into\r\nthe river. Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the bag\r\nof meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.\r\nI took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the\r\nbottom of it with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on the\r\nplace--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking. Then\r\nI carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through\r\nthe willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide\r\nand full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season. There\r\nwas a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went\r\nmiles away, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river. The meal\r\nsifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. I dropped\r\npap's whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by\r\naccident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it\r\nwouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.\r\n\r\nIt was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some\r\nwillows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I\r\nmade fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid\r\ndown in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to myself,\r\nthey'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then\r\ndrag the river for me. And they'll follow that meal track to the lake\r\nand go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers\r\nthat killed me and took the things. They won't ever hunt the river for\r\nanything but my dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of that, and won't\r\nbother no more about me. All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.\r\nJackson's Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,\r\nand nobody ever comes there. And then I can paddle over to town nights,\r\nand slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson's Island's the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nI was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When\r\nI woke up I didn't know where I was for a minute. I set up and looked\r\naround, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and\r\nmiles across. The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs\r\nthat went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from\r\nshore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.\r\nYou know what I mean--I don't know the words to put it in.\r\n\r\nI took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start\r\nwhen I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon I\r\nmade it out. It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from\r\noars working in rowlocks when it's a still night. I peeped out through\r\nthe willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water.\r\nI couldn't tell how many was in it. It kept a-coming, and when it was\r\nabreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it. Think's I, maybe\r\nit's pap, though I warn't expecting him. He dropped below me with the\r\ncurrent, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,\r\nand he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him.\r\nWell, it _was_ pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he laid his\r\noars.\r\n\r\nI didn't lose no time. The next minute I was a-spinning down stream\r\nsoft but quick in the shade of the bank. I made two mile and a half,\r\nand then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of\r\nthe river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and\r\npeople might see me and hail me. I got out amongst the driftwood, and\r\nthen laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.\r\n\r\nI laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking\r\naway into the sky; not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so deep when\r\nyou lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.\r\nAnd how far a body can hear on the water such nights! I heard people\r\ntalking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too--every word\r\nof it. One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short\r\nnights now. T'other one said _this_ warn't one of the short ones, he\r\nreckoned--and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they\r\nlaughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and\r\nlaughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said\r\nlet him alone. The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his\r\nold woman--she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn't\r\nnothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it\r\nwas nearly three o'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than\r\nabout a week longer. After that the talk got further and further away,\r\nand I couldn't make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble,\r\nand now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.\r\n\r\nI was away below the ferry now. I rose up, and there was Jackson's\r\nIsland, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and\r\nstanding up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like\r\na steamboat without any lights. There warn't any signs of the bar at\r\nthe head--it was all under water now.\r\n\r\nIt didn't take me long to get there. I shot past the head at a ripping\r\nrate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and\r\nlanded on the side towards the Illinois shore. I run the canoe into\r\na deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow\r\nbranches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe\r\nfrom the outside.\r\n\r\nI went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked\r\nout on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,\r\nthree mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling. A\r\nmonstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,\r\nwith a lantern in the middle of it. I watched it come creeping down,\r\nand when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, \u201cStern\r\noars, there! heave her head to stabboard!\u201d I heard that just as plain\r\nas if the man was by my side.\r\n\r\nThere was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and\r\nlaid down for a nap before breakfast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight\r\no'clock. I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about\r\nthings, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. I\r\ncould see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees\r\nall about, and gloomy in there amongst them. There was freckled places\r\non the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the\r\nfreckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little\r\nbreeze up there. A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me\r\nvery friendly.\r\n\r\nI was powerful lazy and comfortable--didn't want to get up and cook\r\nbreakfast. Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep\r\nsound of \u201cboom!\u201d away up the river. I rouses up, and rests on my elbow\r\nand listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I hopped up, and went and\r\nlooked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying\r\non the water a long ways up--about abreast the ferry. And there was the\r\nferryboat full of people floating along down. I knowed what was the\r\nmatter now.  \u201cBoom!\u201d I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat's\r\nside. You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my\r\ncarcass come to the top.\r\n\r\nI was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire,\r\nbecause they might see the smoke. So I set there and watched the\r\ncannon-smoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide there,\r\nand it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a good\r\nenough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to\r\neat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in\r\nloaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the\r\ndrownded carcass and stop there. So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, and\r\nif any of them's floating around after me I'll give them a show. I\r\nchanged to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could\r\nhave, and I warn't disappointed. A big double loaf come along, and I\r\nmost got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out\r\nfurther. Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the\r\nshore--I knowed enough for that. But by and by along comes another one,\r\nand this time I won. I took out the plug and shook out the little dab\r\nof quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It was \u201cbaker's bread\u201d--what the\r\nquality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.\r\n\r\nI got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching\r\nthe bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied. And\r\nthen something struck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson\r\nor somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone\r\nand done it. So there ain't no doubt but there is something in that\r\nthing--that is, there's something in it when a body like the widow or the\r\nparson prays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't work for\r\nonly just the right kind.\r\n\r\nI lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. The\r\nferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a chance\r\nto see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in\r\nclose, where the bread did. When she'd got pretty well along down\r\ntowards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,\r\nand laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place. Where\r\nthe log forked I could peep through.\r\n\r\nBy and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could\r\na run out a plank and walked ashore. Most everybody was on the boat.\r\nPap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom\r\nSawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.\r\nEverybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\u201cLook sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he's\r\nwashed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge. I\r\nhope so, anyway.\u201d\r\n\r\nI didn't hope so. They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly\r\nin my face, and kept still, watching with all their might. I could see\r\nthem first-rate, but they couldn't see me. Then the captain sung out:\r\n\r\n\u201cStand away!\u201d and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that\r\nit made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and\r\nI judged I was gone. If they'd a had some bullets in, I reckon they'd\r\na got the corpse they was after. Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks to\r\ngoodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder\r\nof the island. I could hear the booming now and then, further and\r\nfurther off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more.\r\nThe island was three mile long. I judged they had got to the foot, and\r\nwas giving it up. But they didn't yet a while. They turned around\r\nthe foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side,\r\nunder steam, and booming once in a while as they went. I crossed over\r\nto that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the\r\nisland they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and\r\nwent home to the town.\r\n\r\nI knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come a-hunting after\r\nme. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick\r\nwoods. I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things\r\nunder so the rain couldn't get at them. I catched a catfish and haggled\r\nhim open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had\r\nsupper. Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.\r\n\r\nWhen it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well\r\nsatisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set\r\non the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the\r\nstars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;\r\nthere ain't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you\r\ncan't stay so, you soon get over it.\r\n\r\nAnd so for three days and nights. No difference--just the same thing.\r\nBut the next day I went exploring around down through the island. I was\r\nboss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know\r\nall about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. I found plenty\r\nstrawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green\r\nrazberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show. They\r\nwould all come handy by and by, I judged.\r\n\r\nWell, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't\r\nfar from the foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I hadn't shot\r\nnothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh\r\nhome. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake,\r\nand it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after\r\nit, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I\r\nbounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.\r\n\r\nMy heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look\r\nfurther, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as\r\nfast as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the\r\nthick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't hear\r\nnothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;\r\nand so on, and so on. If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod\r\non a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my\r\nbreaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't much sand\r\nin my craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around. So I\r\ngot all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,\r\nand I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an\r\nold last year's camp, and then clumb a tree.\r\n\r\nI reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see nothing,\r\nI didn't hear nothing--I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a\r\nthousand things. Well, I couldn't stay up there forever; so at last I\r\ngot down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the\r\ntime. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nBy the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good\r\nand dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the\r\nIllinois bank--about a quarter of a mile. I went out in the woods and\r\ncooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there\r\nall night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says\r\nto myself, horses coming; and next I hear people's voices. I got\r\neverything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping\r\nthrough the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn't got far when I\r\nhear a man say:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about\r\nbeat out. Let's look around.\u201d\r\n\r\nI didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in the\r\nold place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.\r\n\r\nI didn't sleep much. I couldn't, somehow, for thinking. And every time\r\nI waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. So the sleep didn't\r\ndo me no good. By and by I says to myself, I can't live this way; I'm\r\na-going to find out who it is that's here on the island with me; I'll\r\nfind it out or bust. Well, I felt better right off.\r\n\r\nSo I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and\r\nthen let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was\r\nshining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.\r\nI poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound\r\nasleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island. A\r\nlittle ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying\r\nthe night was about done. I give her a turn with the paddle and brung\r\nher nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge\r\nof the woods. I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the\r\nleaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket\r\nthe river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops,\r\nand knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped off towards\r\nwhere I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two\r\nto listen. But I hadn't no luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the\r\nplace. But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away\r\nthrough the trees. I went for it, cautious and slow. By and by I was\r\nclose enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground. It\r\nmost give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his\r\nhead was nearly in the fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes, in\r\nabout six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It was getting\r\ngray daylight now. Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove\r\noff the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim! I bet I was glad to see\r\nhim. I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHello, Jim!\u201d and skipped out.\r\n\r\nHe bounced up and stared at me wild. Then he drops down on his knees,\r\nand puts his hands together and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDoan' hurt me--don't! I hain't ever done no harm to a ghos'. I alwuz\r\nliked dead people, en done all I could for 'em. You go en git in de\r\nriver agin, whah you b'longs, en doan' do nuffn to Ole Jim, 'at 'uz\r\nawluz yo' fren'.\u201d\r\n\r\nWell, I warn't long making him understand I warn't dead. I was ever so\r\nglad to see Jim. I warn't lonesome now. I told him I warn't afraid of\r\n_him_ telling the people where I was. I talked along, but he only set\r\nthere and looked at me; never said nothing. Then I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's good daylight. Le's get breakfast. Make up your camp fire good.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich\r\ntruck? But you got a gun, hain't you? Den we kin git sumfn better den\r\nstrawbries.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStrawberries and such truck,\u201d I says.  \u201cIs that what you live on?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn' git nuffn else,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, how long you been on the island, Jim?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI come heah de night arter you's killed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat, all that time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes--indeedy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sah--nuffn else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you must be most starved, ain't you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reck'n I could eat a hoss. I think I could. How long you ben on de\r\nislan'?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSince the night I got killed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! W'y, what has you lived on? But you got a gun. Oh, yes, you got\r\na gun. Dat's good. Now you kill sumfn en I'll make up de fire.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in\r\na grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and\r\ncoffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the\r\nnigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done\r\nwith witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him\r\nwith his knife, and fried him.\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.\r\nJim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. Then\r\nwhen we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied. By and by\r\nJim says:\r\n\r\n\u201cBut looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat 'uz killed in dat shanty ef it\r\nwarn't you?\u201d\r\n\r\nThen I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. He said Tom\r\nSawyer couldn't get up no better plan than what I had. Then I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you come to be here, Jim, and how'd you get here?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked pretty uneasy, and didn't say nothing for a minute. Then he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe I better not tell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Jim?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, dey's reasons. But you wouldn' tell on me ef I uz to tell you,\r\nwould you, Huck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBlamed if I would, Jim.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I b'lieve you, Huck. I--_I run off_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJim!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut mind, you said you wouldn' tell--you know you said you wouldn' tell,\r\nHuck.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I did. I said I wouldn't, and I'll stick to it. Honest _injun_,\r\nI will. People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for\r\nkeeping mum--but that don't make no difference. I ain't a-going to tell,\r\nand I ain't a-going back there, anyways. So, now, le's know all about\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you see, it 'uz dis way. Ole missus--dat's Miss Watson--she pecks\r\non me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she\r\nwouldn' sell me down to Orleans. But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader\r\nroun' de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy. Well, one\r\nnight I creeps to de do' pooty late, en de do' warn't quite shet, en I\r\nhear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but\r\nshe didn' want to, but she could git eight hund'd dollars for me, en it\r\n'uz sich a big stack o' money she couldn' resis'. De widder she try to\r\ngit her to say she wouldn' do it, but I never waited to hear de res'. I\r\nlit out mighty quick, I tell you.\r\n\r\n\u201cI tuck out en shin down de hill, en 'spec to steal a skift 'long de\r\nsho' som'ers 'bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid\r\nin de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to\r\ngo 'way. Well, I wuz dah all night. Dey wuz somebody roun' all de time.\r\n 'Long 'bout six in de mawnin' skifts begin to go by, en 'bout eight er\r\nnine every skift dat went 'long wuz talkin' 'bout how yo' pap come over\r\nto de town en say you's killed. Dese las' skifts wuz full o' ladies en\r\ngenlmen a-goin' over for to see de place. Sometimes dey'd pull up at\r\nde sho' en take a res' b'fo' dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to\r\nknow all 'bout de killin'. I 'uz powerful sorry you's killed, Huck, but\r\nI ain't no mo' now.\r\n\r\n\u201cI laid dah under de shavin's all day. I 'uz hungry, but I warn't\r\nafeard; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin' to start to\r\nde camp-meet'n' right arter breakfas' en be gone all day, en dey knows\r\nI goes off wid de cattle 'bout daylight, so dey wouldn' 'spec to see me\r\nroun' de place, en so dey wouldn' miss me tell arter dark in de evenin'.\r\nDe yuther servants wouldn' miss me, kase dey'd shin out en take holiday\r\nsoon as de ole folks 'uz out'n de way.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went 'bout two\r\nmile er more to whah dey warn't no houses. I'd made up my mine 'bout\r\nwhat I's agwyne to do. You see, ef I kep' on tryin' to git away afoot,\r\nde dogs 'ud track me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey'd miss dat\r\nskift, you see, en dey'd know 'bout whah I'd lan' on de yuther side, en\r\nwhah to pick up my track. So I says, a raff is what I's arter; it doan'\r\n_make_ no track.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see a light a-comin' roun' de p'int bymeby, so I wade' in en shove'\r\na log ahead o' me en swum more'n half way acrost de river, en got in\r\n'mongst de drift-wood, en kep' my head down low, en kinder swum agin de\r\ncurrent tell de raff come along. Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck\r\na-holt. It clouded up en 'uz pooty dark for a little while. So I clumb\r\nup en laid down on de planks. De men 'uz all 'way yonder in de middle,\r\nwhah de lantern wuz. De river wuz a-risin', en dey wuz a good current;\r\nso I reck'n'd 'at by fo' in de mawnin' I'd be twenty-five mile down de\r\nriver, en den I'd slip in jis b'fo' daylight en swim asho', en take to\r\nde woods on de Illinois side.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I didn' have no luck. When we 'uz mos' down to de head er de\r\nislan' a man begin to come aft wid de lantern, I see it warn't no use\r\nfer to wait, so I slid overboard en struck out fer de islan'. Well, I\r\nhad a notion I could lan' mos' anywhers, but I couldn't--bank too bluff.\r\nI 'uz mos' to de foot er de islan' b'fo' I found' a good place. I went\r\ninto de woods en jedged I wouldn' fool wid raffs no mo', long as dey\r\nmove de lantern roun' so. I had my pipe en a plug er dog-leg, en some\r\nmatches in my cap, en dey warn't wet, so I 'uz all right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so you ain't had no meat nor bread to eat all this time? Why\r\ndidn't you get mud-turkles?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow you gwyne to git 'm? You can't slip up on um en grab um; en how's\r\na body gwyne to hit um wid a rock? How could a body do it in de night?\r\nEn I warn't gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that's so. You've had to keep in the woods all the time, of\r\ncourse. Did you hear 'em shooting the cannon?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes. I knowed dey was arter you. I see um go by heah--watched um\r\nthoo de bushes.\u201d\r\n\r\nSome young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and\r\nlighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain. He said it was\r\na sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the\r\nsame way when young birds done it. I was going to catch some of them,\r\nbut Jim wouldn't let me. He said it was death. He said his father laid\r\nmighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny\r\nsaid his father would die, and he did.\r\n\r\nAnd Jim said you mustn't count the things you are going to cook for\r\ndinner, because that would bring bad luck. The same if you shook the\r\ntable-cloth after sundown. And he said if a man owned a beehive\r\nand that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next\r\nmorning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die.\r\nJim said bees wouldn't sting idiots; but I didn't believe that, because\r\nI had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn't sting me.\r\n\r\nI had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. Jim\r\nknowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said\r\nit looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked\r\nhim if there warn't any good-luck signs. He says:\r\n\r\n\u201cMighty few--an' _dey_ ain't no use to a body. What you want to know\r\nwhen good luck's a-comin' for? Want to keep it off?\u201d And he said:  \u201cEf\r\nyou's got hairy arms en a hairy breas', it's a sign dat you's agwyne\r\nto be rich. Well, dey's some use in a sign like dat, 'kase it's so fur\r\nahead. You see, maybe you's got to be po' a long time fust, en so you\r\nmight git discourage' en kill yo'sef 'f you didn' know by de sign dat\r\nyou gwyne to be rich bymeby.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat's de use to ax dat question? Don't you see I has?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, are you rich?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin. Wunst I had\r\nfoteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat'n', en got busted out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you speculate in, Jim?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, fust I tackled stock.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat kind of stock?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, live stock--cattle, you know. I put ten dollars in a cow. But\r\nI ain' gwyne to resk no mo' money in stock. De cow up 'n' died on my\r\nhan's.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you lost the ten dollars.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I didn't lose it all. I on'y los' 'bout nine of it. I sole de\r\nhide en taller for a dollar en ten cents.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou had five dollars and ten cents left. Did you speculate any more?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. You know that one-laigged nigger dat b'longs to old Misto\r\nBradish? Well, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a dollar\r\nwould git fo' dollars mo' at de en' er de year. Well, all de niggers\r\nwent in, but dey didn't have much. I wuz de on'y one dat had much. So\r\nI stuck out for mo' dan fo' dollars, en I said 'f I didn' git it I'd\r\nstart a bank mysef. Well, o' course dat nigger want' to keep me out er\r\nde business, bekase he says dey warn't business 'nough for two banks, so\r\nhe say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en'\r\ner de year.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I done it. Den I reck'n'd I'd inves' de thirty-five dollars right\r\noff en keep things a-movin'. Dey wuz a nigger name' Bob, dat had\r\nketched a wood-flat, en his marster didn' know it; en I bought it off'n\r\nhim en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en' er de\r\nyear come; but somebody stole de wood-flat dat night, en nex day de\r\none-laigged nigger say de bank's busted. So dey didn' none uv us git no\r\nmoney.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you do with the ten cents, Jim?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I 'uz gwyne to spen' it, but I had a dream, en de dream tole me\r\nto give it to a nigger name' Balum--Balum's Ass dey call him for short;\r\nhe's one er dem chuckleheads, you know. But he's lucky, dey say, en I\r\nsee I warn't lucky. De dream say let Balum inves' de ten cents en he'd\r\nmake a raise for me. Well, Balum he tuck de money, en when he wuz in\r\nchurch he hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po' len' to de\r\nLord, en boun' to git his money back a hund'd times. So Balum he tuck\r\nen give de ten cents to de po', en laid low to see what wuz gwyne to\r\ncome of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what did come of it, Jim?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNuffn never come of it. I couldn' manage to k'leck dat money no way;\r\nen Balum he couldn'. I ain' gwyne to len' no mo' money 'dout I see de\r\nsecurity. Boun' to git yo' money back a hund'd times, de preacher says!\r\nEf I could git de ten _cents_ back, I'd call it squah, en be glad er de\r\nchanst.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it's all right anyway, Jim, long as you're going to be rich again\r\nsome time or other.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; en I's rich now, come to look at it. I owns mysef, en I's wuth\r\neight hund'd dollars. I wisht I had de money, I wouldn' want no mo'.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island\r\nthat I'd found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,\r\nbecause the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nThis place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot\r\nhigh. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and\r\nthe bushes so thick. We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by\r\nand by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the\r\nside towards Illinois. The cavern was as big as two or three rooms\r\nbunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it. It was cool in\r\nthere. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we\r\ndidn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.\r\n\r\nJim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps\r\nin the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island,\r\nand they would never find us without dogs. And, besides, he said them\r\nlittle birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to\r\nget wet?\r\n\r\nSo we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,\r\nand lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by\r\nto hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off\r\nof the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.\r\n\r\nThe door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one\r\nside of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a\r\ngood place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner.\r\n\r\nWe spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.\r\nWe put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern. Pretty\r\nsoon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was\r\nright about it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury,\r\ntoo, and I never see the wind blow so. It was one of these regular\r\nsummer storms. It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black\r\noutside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that\r\nthe trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would\r\ncome a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the\r\npale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would\r\nfollow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they\r\nwas just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and\r\nblackest--_FST_! it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a little\r\nglimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm,\r\nhundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again\r\nin a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash,\r\nand then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the\r\nunder side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs--where\r\nit's long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.\r\n\r\n\u201cJim, this is nice,\u201d I says.  \u201cI wouldn't want to be nowhere else but\r\nhere. Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you wouldn't a ben here 'f it hadn't a ben for Jim. You'd a ben\r\ndown dah in de woods widout any dinner, en gittn' mos' drownded, too;\r\ndat you would, honey. Chickens knows when it's gwyne to rain, en so do\r\nde birds, chile.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at\r\nlast it was over the banks. The water was three or four foot deep on\r\nthe island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom. On that side\r\nit was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same\r\nold distance across--a half a mile--because the Missouri shore was just a\r\nwall of high bluffs.\r\n\r\nDaytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool\r\nand shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside. We\r\nwent winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung\r\nso thick we had to back away and go some other way. Well, on every old\r\nbroken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and\r\nwhen the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on\r\naccount of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your\r\nhand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles--they would\r\nslide off in the water. The ridge our cavern was in was full of them.\r\nWe could a had pets enough if we'd wanted them.\r\n\r\nOne night we catched a little section of a lumber raft--nice pine planks.\r\nIt was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and\r\nthe top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor. We\r\ncould see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go;\r\nwe didn't show ourselves in daylight.\r\n\r\nAnother night when we was up at the head of the island, just before\r\ndaylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side. She was\r\na two-story, and tilted over considerable. We paddled out and got\r\naboard--clumb in at an upstairs window. But it was too dark to see yet,\r\nso we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.\r\n\r\nThe light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. Then\r\nwe looked in at the window. We could make out a bed, and a table, and\r\ntwo old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there\r\nwas clothes hanging against the wall. There was something laying on the\r\nfloor in the far corner that looked like a man. So Jim says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHello, you!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut it didn't budge. So I hollered again, and then Jim says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDe man ain't asleep--he's dead. You hold still--I'll go en see.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe went, and bent down and looked, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's a dead man. Yes, indeedy; naked, too. He's ben shot in de back.\r\nI reck'n he's ben dead two er three days. Come in, Huck, but doan' look\r\nat his face--it's too gashly.\u201d\r\n\r\nI didn't look at him at all. Jim throwed some old rags over him, but\r\nhe needn't done it; I didn't want to see him. There was heaps of old\r\ngreasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles,\r\nand a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls\r\nwas the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.\r\nThere was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some\r\nwomen's underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men's clothing,\r\ntoo. We put the lot into the canoe--it might come good. There was a\r\nboy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too. And there\r\nwas a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a\r\nbaby to suck. We would a took the bottle, but it was broke. There was\r\na seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke. They\r\nstood open, but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account.\r\nThe way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a\r\nhurry, and warn't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.\r\n\r\nWe got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and\r\na bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow\r\ncandles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty\r\nold bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and\r\nbeeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet\r\nand some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some\r\nmonstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar,\r\nand a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn't have no label\r\non them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb,\r\nand Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg. The straps\r\nwas broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though\r\nit was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn't find\r\nthe other one, though we hunted all around.\r\n\r\nAnd so, take it all around, we made a good haul. When we was ready to\r\nshove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty\r\nbroad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the\r\nquilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good\r\nways off. I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most\r\na half a mile doing it. I crept up the dead water under the bank, and\r\nhadn't no accidents and didn't see nobody. We got home all safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he\r\ncome to be killed, but Jim didn't want to. He said it would fetch bad\r\nluck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha'nt us; he said a man\r\nthat warn't buried was more likely to go a-ha'nting around than one\r\nthat was planted and comfortable. That sounded pretty reasonable, so\r\nI didn't say no more; but I couldn't keep from studying over it and\r\nwishing I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.\r\n\r\nWe rummaged the clothes we'd got, and found eight dollars in silver\r\nsewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat. Jim said he reckoned\r\nthe people in that house stole the coat, because if they'd a knowed the\r\nmoney was there they wouldn't a left it. I said I reckoned they killed\r\nhim, too; but Jim didn't want to talk about that. I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow you think it's bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in the\r\nsnake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday?\r\nYou said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin\r\nwith my hands. Well, here's your bad luck! We've raked in all this\r\ntruck and eight dollars besides. I wish we could have some bad luck\r\nlike this every day, Jim.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever you mind, honey, never you mind. Don't you git too peart. It's\r\na-comin'. Mind I tell you, it's a-comin'.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt did come, too. It was a Tuesday that we had that talk. Well, after\r\ndinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the\r\nridge, and got out of tobacco. I went to the cavern to get some, and\r\nfound a rattlesnake in there. I killed him, and curled him up on the\r\nfoot of Jim's blanket, ever so natural, thinking there'd be some fun\r\nwhen Jim found him there. Well, by night I forgot all about the snake,\r\nand when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light\r\nthe snake's mate was there, and bit him.\r\n\r\nHe jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the\r\nvarmint curled up and ready for another spring. I laid him out in a\r\nsecond with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap's whisky-jug and begun to pour\r\nit down.\r\n\r\nHe was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all\r\ncomes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave\r\na dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. Jim told\r\nme to chop off the snake's head and throw it away, and then skin the\r\nbody and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he eat it and said it\r\nwould help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around\r\nhis wrist, too. He said that that would help. Then I slid out quiet\r\nand throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn't going\r\nto let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.\r\n\r\nJim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his\r\nhead and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he\r\nwent to sucking at the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big, and\r\nso did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged\r\nhe was all right; but I'd druther been bit with a snake than pap's\r\nwhisky.\r\n\r\nJim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all\r\ngone and he was around again. I made up my mind I wouldn't ever take\r\na-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come\r\nof it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. And he said\r\nthat handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn't\r\ngot to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the new moon over his\r\nleft shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin\r\nin his hand. Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I've\r\nalways reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is\r\none of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do. Old Hank\r\nBunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years he\r\ngot drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so\r\nthat he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him\r\nedgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so\r\nthey say, but I didn't see it. Pap told me. But anyway it all come of\r\nlooking at the moon that way, like a fool.\r\n\r\nWell, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks\r\nagain; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big\r\nhooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was\r\nas big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two\r\nhundred pounds. We couldn't handle him, of course; he would a flung us\r\ninto Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around\r\ntill he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a round\r\nball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet,\r\nand there was a spool in it. Jim said he'd had it there a long time, to\r\ncoat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was ever\r\ncatched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn't ever seen\r\na bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at the village.\r\nThey peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house\r\nthere; everybody buys some of him; his meat's as white as snow and makes\r\na good fry.\r\n\r\nNext morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a\r\nstirring up some way. I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and\r\nfind out what was going on. Jim liked that notion; but he said I\r\nmust go in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and said,\r\ncouldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?\r\nThat was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the calico\r\ngowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it. Jim\r\nhitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. I put on the\r\nsun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in\r\nand see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe. Jim said\r\nnobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly. I practiced around\r\nall day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty\r\nwell in them, only Jim said I didn't walk like a girl; and he said\r\nI must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket. I took\r\nnotice, and done better.\r\n\r\nI started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.\r\n\r\nI started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and\r\nthe drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town. I\r\ntied up and started along the bank. There was a light burning in a\r\nlittle shanty that hadn't been lived in for a long time, and I wondered\r\nwho had took up quarters there. I slipped up and peeped in at the\r\nwindow. There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by\r\na candle that was on a pine table. I didn't know her face; she was a\r\nstranger, for you couldn't start a face in that town that I didn't know.\r\nNow this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had\r\ncome; people might know my voice and find me out. But if this woman had\r\nbeen in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to\r\nknow; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn't forget I\r\nwas a girl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in,\u201d says the woman, and I did. She says:  \u201cTake a cheer.\u201d\r\n\r\nI done it. She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat might your name be?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSarah Williams.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere 'bouts do you live? In this neighborhood?'\r\n\r\n\u201cNo'm. In Hookerville, seven mile below. I've walked all the way and\r\nI'm all tired out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHungry, too, I reckon. I'll find you something.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo'm, I ain't hungry. I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below\r\nhere at a farm; so I ain't hungry no more. It's what makes me so late.\r\nMy mother's down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come to\r\ntell my uncle Abner Moore. He lives at the upper end of the town, she\r\nsays. I hain't ever been here before. Do you know him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; but I don't know everybody yet. I haven't lived here quite two\r\nweeks. It's a considerable ways to the upper end of the town. You\r\nbetter stay here all night. Take off your bonnet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I says; \u201cI'll rest a while, I reckon, and go on. I ain't afeared\r\nof the dark.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe said she wouldn't let me go by myself, but her husband would be in\r\nby and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she'd send him along with me.\r\nThen she got to talking about her husband, and about her relations up\r\nthe river, and her relations down the river, and about how much better\r\noff they used to was, and how they didn't know but they'd made a mistake\r\ncoming to our town, instead of letting well alone--and so on and so on,\r\ntill I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what\r\nwas going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the\r\nmurder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along.\r\nShe told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only\r\nshe got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and what\r\na hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was murdered. I\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\u201cWho done it? We've heard considerable about these goings on down in\r\nHookerville, but we don't know who 'twas that killed Huck Finn.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I reckon there's a right smart chance of people _here_ that'd\r\nlike to know who killed him. Some think old Finn done it himself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo--is that so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMost everybody thought it at first. He'll never know how nigh he come\r\nto getting lynched. But before night they changed around and judged it\r\nwas done by a runaway nigger named Jim.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy _he_--\u201d\r\n\r\nI stopped. I reckoned I better keep still. She run on, and never\r\nnoticed I had put in at all:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed. So there's a\r\nreward out for him--three hundred dollars. And there's a reward out for\r\nold Finn, too--two hundred dollars. You see, he come to town the\r\nmorning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with 'em on the\r\nferryboat hunt, and right away after he up and left. Before night they\r\nwanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see. Well, next day they\r\nfound out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn't ben seen sence\r\nten o'clock the night the murder was done. So then they put it on him,\r\nyou see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn,\r\nand went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the\r\nnigger all over Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and that evening\r\nhe got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty\r\nhard-looking strangers, and then went off with them. Well, he hain't\r\ncome back sence, and they ain't looking for him back till this thing\r\nblows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and\r\nfixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he'd get\r\nHuck's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.\r\nPeople do say he warn't any too good to do it. Oh, he's sly, I reckon.\r\nIf he don't come back for a year he'll be all right. You can't prove\r\nanything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, and\r\nhe'll walk in Huck's money as easy as nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I reckon so, 'm. I don't see nothing in the way of it. Has\r\neverybody quit thinking the nigger done it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, not everybody. A good many thinks he done it. But they'll get\r\nthe nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it out of him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, are they after him yet?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you're innocent, ain't you! Does three hundred dollars lay\r\naround every day for people to pick up? Some folks think the nigger\r\nain't far from here. I'm one of them--but I hain't talked it around. A\r\nfew days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in\r\nthe log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to\r\nthat island over yonder that they call Jackson's Island. Don't anybody\r\nlive there? says I. No, nobody, says they. I didn't say any more, but\r\nI done some thinking. I was pretty near certain I'd seen smoke over\r\nthere, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says\r\nto myself, like as not that nigger's hiding over there; anyway, says\r\nI, it's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt. I hain't seen any\r\nsmoke sence, so I reckon maybe he's gone, if it was him; but husband's\r\ngoing over to see--him and another man. He was gone up the river; but he\r\ngot back to-day, and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had got so uneasy I couldn't set still. I had to do something with my\r\nhands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading\r\nit. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it. When the woman\r\nstopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curious\r\nand smiling a little. I put down the needle and thread, and let on to\r\nbe interested--and I was, too--and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cThree hundred dollars is a power of money. I wish my mother could get\r\nit. Is your husband going over there to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes. He went up-town with the man I was telling you of, to get a\r\nboat and see if they could borrow another gun. They'll go over after\r\nmidnight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCouldn't they see better if they was to wait till daytime?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. And couldn't the nigger see better, too? After midnight he'll\r\nlikely be asleep, and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up\r\nhis camp fire all the better for the dark, if he's got one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn't think of that.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn't feel a bit\r\ncomfortable. Pretty soon she says,\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you say your name was, honey?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cM--Mary Williams.\u201d\r\n\r\nSomehow it didn't seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I didn't\r\nlook up--seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of cornered,\r\nand was afeared maybe I was looking it, too. I wished the woman would\r\nsay something more; the longer she set still the uneasier I was. But\r\nnow she says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHoney, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes'm, I did. Sarah Mary Williams. Sarah's my first name. Some\r\ncalls me Sarah, some calls me Mary.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that's the way of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes'm.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway. I\r\ncouldn't look up yet.\r\n\r\nWell, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor\r\nthey had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the\r\nplace, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again. She was right\r\nabout the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner\r\nevery little while. She said she had to have things handy to throw at\r\nthem when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace. She showed\r\nme a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot\r\nwith it generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn't\r\nknow whether she could throw true now. But she watched for a chance,\r\nand directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said\r\n\u201cOuch!\u201d it hurt her arm so. Then she told me to try for the next one.\r\nI wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course\r\nI didn't let on. I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his\r\nnose I let drive, and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a\r\ntolerable sick rat. She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I\r\nwould hive the next one. She went and got the lump of lead and fetched\r\nit back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help\r\nher with. I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and\r\nwent on talking about her and her husband's matters. But she broke off\r\nto say:\r\n\r\n\u201cKeep your eye on the rats. You better have the lead in your lap,\r\nhandy.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped\r\nmy legs together on it and she went on talking. But only about a\r\nminute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face,\r\nand very pleasant, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, now, what's your real name?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWh--what, mum?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat's your real name? Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?--or what is it?\u201d\r\n\r\nI reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn't know hardly what to do. But\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease to don't poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum. If I'm in the\r\nway here, I'll--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, you won't. Set down and stay where you are. I ain't going to hurt\r\nyou, and I ain't going to tell on you, nuther. You just tell me your\r\nsecret, and trust me. I'll keep it; and, what's more, I'll help\r\nyou. So'll my old man if you want him to. You see, you're a runaway\r\n'prentice, that's all. It ain't anything. There ain't no harm in it.\r\nYou've been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut. Bless you,\r\nchild, I wouldn't tell on you. Tell me all about it now, that's a good\r\nboy.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo I said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it any longer, and I\r\nwould just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn't\r\ngo back on her promise. Then I told her my father and mother was dead,\r\nand the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty\r\nmile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn't stand it\r\nno longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my\r\nchance and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and\r\nI had been three nights coming the thirty miles. I traveled nights,\r\nand hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from\r\nhome lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. I said I believed my\r\nuncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck\r\nout for this town of Goshen.\r\n\r\n\u201cGoshen, child? This ain't Goshen. This is St. Petersburg. Goshen's\r\nten mile further up the river. Who told you this was Goshen?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn\r\ninto the woods for my regular sleep. He told me when the roads forked I\r\nmust take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was drunk, I reckon. He told you just exactly wrong.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain't no matter now. I got\r\nto be moving along. I'll fetch Goshen before daylight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHold on a minute. I'll put you up a snack to eat. You might want it.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo she put me up a snack, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, when a cow's laying down, which end of her gets up first? Answer\r\nup prompt now--don't stop to study over it. Which end gets up first?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe hind end, mum.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, a horse?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe for'rard end, mum.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich side of a tree does the moss grow on?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNorth side.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats with\r\ntheir heads pointed the same direction?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe whole fifteen, mum.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I reckon you _have_ lived in the country. I thought maybe you\r\nwas trying to hocus me again. What's your real name, now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGeorge Peters, mum.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, try to remember it, George. Don't forget and tell me it's\r\nElexander before you go, and then get out by saying it's George\r\nElexander when I catch you. And don't go about women in that old\r\ncalico. You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe.\r\nBless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don't hold the\r\nthread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and\r\npoke the thread at it; that's the way a woman most always does, but a\r\nman always does t'other way. And when you throw at a rat or anything,\r\nhitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as\r\nawkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw\r\nstiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to\r\nturn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out\r\nto one side, like a boy. And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch\r\nanything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don't clap them\r\ntogether, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead. Why, I\r\nspotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrived\r\nthe other things just to make certain. Now trot along to your uncle,\r\nSarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble\r\nyou send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I'll do what I can\r\nto get you out of it. Keep the river road all the way, and next time\r\nyou tramp take shoes and socks with you. The river road's a rocky one,\r\nand your feet'll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon.\u201d\r\n\r\nI went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks\r\nand slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house. I\r\njumped in, and was off in a hurry. I went up-stream far enough to\r\nmake the head of the island, and then started across. I took off the\r\nsun-bonnet, for I didn't want no blinders on then. When I was about the\r\nmiddle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the\r\nsound come faint over the water but clear--eleven. When I struck the\r\nhead of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but\r\nI shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started\r\na good fire there on a high and dry spot.\r\n\r\nThen I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half\r\nbelow, as hard as I could go. I landed, and slopped through the timber\r\nand up the ridge and into the cavern. There Jim laid, sound asleep on\r\nthe ground. I roused him out and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cGit up and hump yourself, Jim! There ain't a minute to lose. They're\r\nafter us!\u201d\r\n\r\nJim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he\r\nworked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared. By\r\nthat time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was\r\nready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid. We\r\nput out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn't show a\r\ncandle outside after that.\r\n\r\nI took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look;\r\nbut if there was a boat around I couldn't see it, for stars and shadows\r\nain't good to see by. Then we got out the raft and slipped along down\r\nin the shade, past the foot of the island dead still--never saying a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at\r\nlast, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. If a boat was to come\r\nalong we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois\r\nshore; and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever thought to\r\nput the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat. We\r\nwas in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things. It warn't\r\ngood judgment to put _everything_ on the raft.\r\n\r\nIf the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I\r\nbuilt, and watched it all night for Jim to come. Anyways, they stayed\r\naway from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn't no\r\nfault of mine. I played it as low down on them as I could.\r\n\r\nWhen the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a\r\nbig bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with\r\nthe hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there\r\nhad been a cave-in in the bank there. A tow-head is a sandbar that has\r\ncottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.\r\n\r\nWe had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois\r\nside, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we\r\nwarn't afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all day,\r\nand watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and\r\nup-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I told Jim all\r\nabout the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was\r\na smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set\r\ndown and watch a camp fire--no, sir, she'd fetch a dog. Well, then, I\r\nsaid, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog? Jim said he\r\nbet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he\r\nbelieved they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that\r\ntime, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile\r\nbelow the village--no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.\r\nSo I said I didn't care what was the reason they didn't get us as long\r\nas they didn't.\r\n\r\nWhen it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the\r\ncottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;\r\nso Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug\r\nwigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things\r\ndry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above\r\nthe level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of\r\nreach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a\r\nlayer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for\r\nto hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather\r\nor chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra\r\nsteering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag\r\nor something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern\r\non, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat\r\ncoming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't have\r\nto light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call\r\na \u201ccrossing\u201d; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being\r\nstill a little under water; so up-bound boats didn't always run the\r\nchannel, but hunted easy water.\r\n\r\nThis second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current\r\nthat was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked,\r\nand we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of\r\nsolemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking\r\nup at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it\r\nwarn't often that we laughed--only a little kind of a low chuckle. We\r\nhad mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to\r\nus at all--that night, nor the next, nor the next.\r\n\r\nEvery night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,\r\nnothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. The\r\nfifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.\r\nIn St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand\r\npeople in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful\r\nspread of lights at two o'clock that still night. There warn't a sound\r\nthere; everybody was asleep.\r\n\r\nEvery night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little\r\nvillage, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other\r\nstuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't roosting\r\ncomfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a chicken when\r\nyou get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself you can easy\r\nfind somebody that does, and a good deed ain't ever forgot. I never see\r\npap when he didn't want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to\r\nsay, anyway.\r\n\r\nMornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a\r\nwatermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of\r\nthat kind. Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you\r\nwas meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn't\r\nanything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.\r\nJim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly\r\nright; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things\r\nfrom the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more--then he reckoned\r\nit wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others. So we talked it over all\r\none night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds\r\nwhether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,\r\nor what. But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and\r\nconcluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons. We warn't feeling just\r\nright before that, but it was all comfortable now. I was glad the way\r\nit come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever good, and the p'simmons\r\nwouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.\r\n\r\nWe shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning\r\nor didn't go to bed early enough in the evening. Take it all round, we\r\nlived pretty high.\r\n\r\nThe fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with\r\na power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid\r\nsheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.\r\nWhen the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,\r\nand high, rocky bluffs on both sides. By and by says I, \u201cHel-_lo_, Jim,\r\nlooky yonder!\u201d It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.\r\nWe was drifting straight down for her. The lightning showed her very\r\ndistinct. She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above\r\nwater, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a\r\nchair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,\r\nwhen the flashes come.\r\n\r\nWell, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like,\r\nI felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck\r\nlaying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river. I\r\nwanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what\r\nthere was there. So I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cLe's land on her, Jim.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Jim was dead against it at first. He says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack. We's doin' blame' well,\r\nen we better let blame' well alone, as de good book says. Like as not\r\ndey's a watchman on dat wrack.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWatchman your grandmother,\u201d I says; \u201cthere ain't nothing to watch but\r\nthe texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody's going to resk\r\nhis life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when\r\nit's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?\u201d Jim\r\ncouldn't say nothing to that, so he didn't try.  \u201cAnd besides,\u201d I says,\r\n\u201cwe might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom.\r\nSeegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. Steamboat\r\ncaptains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_ don't\r\ncare a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it. Stick a\r\ncandle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging.\r\nDo you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing? Not for pie, he\r\nwouldn't. He'd call it an adventure--that's what he'd call it; and he'd\r\nland on that wreck if it was his last act. And wouldn't he throw style\r\ninto it?--wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing? Why, you'd think it\r\nwas Christopher C'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come. I wish Tom Sawyer\r\n_was_ here.\u201d\r\n\r\nJim he grumbled a little, but give in. He said we mustn't talk any more\r\nthan we could help, and then talk mighty low. The lightning showed us\r\nthe wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and\r\nmade fast there.\r\n\r\nThe deck was high out here. We went sneaking down the slope of it to\r\nlabboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our\r\nfeet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so\r\ndark we couldn't see no sign of them. Pretty soon we struck the forward\r\nend of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in\r\nfront of the captain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down\r\nthrough the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we\r\nseem to hear low voices in yonder!\r\n\r\nJim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come\r\nalong. I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just\r\nthen I heard a voice wail out and say:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother voice said, pretty loud:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's a lie, Jim Turner. You've acted this way before. You always want\r\nmore'n your share of the truck, and you've always got it, too, because\r\nyou've swore 't if you didn't you'd tell. But this time you've said\r\nit jest one time too many. You're the meanest, treacherousest hound in\r\nthis country.\u201d\r\n\r\nBy this time Jim was gone for the raft. I was just a-biling with\r\ncuriosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn't back out now,\r\nand so I won't either; I'm a-going to see what's going on here. So I\r\ndropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft\r\nin the dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and the\r\ncross-hall of the texas. Then in there I see a man stretched on the\r\nfloor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one\r\nof them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.\r\nThis one kept pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor, and\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\u201cI'd _like_ to! And I orter, too--a mean skunk!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man on the floor would shrivel up and say, \u201cOh, please don't, Bill;\r\nI hain't ever goin' to tell.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n\u201c'Deed you _ain't!_ You never said no truer thing 'n that, you bet\r\nyou.\u201d And once he said:  \u201cHear him beg! and yit if we hadn't got the\r\nbest of him and tied him he'd a killed us both. And what _for_? Jist\r\nfor noth'n. Jist because we stood on our _rights_--that's what for. But\r\nI lay you ain't a-goin' to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner. Put\r\n_up_ that pistol, Bill.\u201d\r\n\r\nBill says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't want to, Jake Packard. I'm for killin' him--and didn't he kill\r\nold Hatfield jist the same way--and don't he deserve it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I don't _want_ him killed, and I've got my reasons for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBless yo' heart for them words, Jake Packard! I'll never forgit you\r\nlong's I live!\u201d says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.\r\n\r\nPackard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail\r\nand started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill\r\nto come. I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat\r\nslanted so that I couldn't make very good time; so to keep from getting\r\nrun over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side.\r\nThe man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my\r\nstateroom, he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHere--come in here.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in I was up\r\nin the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood there,\r\nwith their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn't see\r\nthem, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they'd been having.\r\nI was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made much difference\r\nanyway, because most of the time they couldn't a treed me because I\r\ndidn't breathe. I was too scared. And, besides, a body _couldn't_\r\nbreathe and hear such talk. They talked low and earnest. Bill wanted\r\nto kill Turner. He says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHe's said he'll tell, and he will. If we was to give both our shares\r\nto him _now_ it wouldn't make no difference after the row and the way\r\nwe've served him. Shore's you're born, he'll turn State's evidence; now\r\nyou hear _me_. I'm for putting him out of his troubles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo'm I,\u201d says Packard, very quiet.\r\n\r\n\u201cBlame it, I'd sorter begun to think you wasn't. Well, then, that's all\r\nright. Le's go and do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHold on a minute; I hain't had my say yit. You listen to me.\r\nShooting's good, but there's quieter ways if the thing's _got_ to be\r\ndone. But what I say is this: it ain't good sense to go court'n around\r\nafter a halter if you can git at what you're up to in some way that's\r\njist as good and at the same time don't bring you into no resks. Ain't\r\nthat so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou bet it is. But how you goin' to manage it this time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, my idea is this: we'll rustle around and gather up whatever\r\npickins we've overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide\r\nthe truck. Then we'll wait. Now I say it ain't a-goin' to be more'n two\r\nhours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river. See?\r\nHe'll be drownded, and won't have nobody to blame for it but his own\r\nself. I reckon that's a considerble sight better 'n killin' of him.\r\nI'm unfavorable to killin' a man as long as you can git aroun' it; it\r\nain't good sense, it ain't good morals. Ain't I right?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I reck'n you are. But s'pose she _don't_ break up and wash off?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can't we?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, then; come along.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled\r\nforward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse\r\nwhisper, \u201cJim!\u201d and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a\r\nmoan, and I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick, Jim, it ain't no time for fooling around and moaning; there's a\r\ngang of murderers in yonder, and if we don't hunt up their boat and set\r\nher drifting down the river so these fellows can't get away from the\r\nwreck there's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix. But if we find their\r\nboat we can put _all_ of 'em in a bad fix--for the sheriff 'll get 'em.\r\nQuick--hurry! I'll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You\r\nstart at the raft, and--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my lordy, lordy! _raf'_? Dey ain' no raf' no mo'; she done broke\r\nloose en gone I--en here we is!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, I catched my breath and most fainted. Shut up on a wreck with\r\nsuch a gang as that! But it warn't no time to be sentimentering. We'd\r\n_got_ to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves. So we went\r\na-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was,\r\ntoo--seemed a week before we got to the stern. No sign of a boat. Jim\r\nsaid he didn't believe he could go any further--so scared he hadn't\r\nhardly any strength left, he said. But I said, come on, if we get left\r\non this wreck we are in a fix, sure. So on we prowled again. We struck\r\nfor the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along\r\nforwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the\r\nedge of the skylight was in the water. When we got pretty close to the\r\ncross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough! I could just barely\r\nsee her. I felt ever so thankful. In another second I would a been\r\naboard of her, but just then the door opened. One of the men stuck his\r\nhead out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone;\r\nbut he jerked it in again, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHeave that blame lantern out o' sight, Bill!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and\r\nset down. It was Packard. Then Bill _he_ come out and got in. Packard\r\nsays, in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cAll ready--shove off!\u201d\r\n\r\nI couldn't hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak. But Bill\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\u201cHold on--'d you go through him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. Didn't you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. So he's got his share o' the cash yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, won't he suspicion what we're up to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe he won't. But we got to have it anyway. Come along.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo they got out and went in.\r\n\r\nThe door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half\r\nsecond I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me. I out with my\r\nknife and cut the rope, and away we went!\r\n\r\nWe didn't touch an oar, and we didn't speak nor whisper, nor hardly even\r\nbreathe. We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the\r\npaddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a\r\nhundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every\r\nlast sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.\r\n\r\nWhen we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern\r\nshow like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed\r\nby that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to\r\nunderstand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.\r\n\r\nThen Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft. Now was the\r\nfirst time that I begun to worry about the men--I reckon I hadn't\r\nhad time to before. I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for\r\nmurderers, to be in such a fix. I says to myself, there ain't no\r\ntelling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how would\r\nI like it? So says I to Jim:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first light we see we'll land a hundred yards below it or above\r\nit, in a place where it's a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and\r\nthen I'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for\r\nthat gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung when\r\ntheir time comes.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again,\r\nand this time worse than ever. The rain poured down, and never a light\r\nshowed; everybody in bed, I reckon. We boomed along down the river,\r\nwatching for lights and watching for our raft. After a long time the\r\nrain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering,\r\nand by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we\r\nmade for it.\r\n\r\nIt was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again. We\r\nseen a light now away down to the right, on shore. So I said I would\r\ngo for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole\r\nthere on the wreck. We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told\r\nJim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone\r\nabout two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars\r\nand shoved for the light. As I got down towards it three or four more\r\nshowed--up on a hillside. It was a village. I closed in above the shore\r\nlight, and laid on my oars and floated. As I went by I see it was a\r\nlantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat. I skimmed\r\naround for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by and\r\nby I found him roosting on the bitts forward, with his head down between\r\nhis knees. I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun to\r\ncry.\r\n\r\nHe stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only\r\nme he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHello, what's up? Don't cry, bub. What's the trouble?\u201d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\u201cPap, and mam, and sis, and--\u201d\r\n\r\nThen I broke down. He says:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, dang it now, _don't_ take on so; we all has to have our troubles,\r\nand this 'n 'll come out all right. What's the matter with 'em?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey're--they're--are you the watchman of the boat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like.  \u201cI'm the captain\r\nand the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head\r\ndeck-hand; and sometimes I'm the freight and passengers. I ain't as\r\nrich as old Jim Hornback, and I can't be so blame' generous and good\r\nto Tom, Dick, and Harry as what he is, and slam around money the way he\r\ndoes; but I've told him a many a time 't I wouldn't trade places with\r\nhim; for, says I, a sailor's life's the life for me, and I'm derned if\r\n_I'd_ live two mile out o' town, where there ain't nothing ever goin'\r\non, not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it. Says I--\u201d\r\n\r\nI broke in and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cThey're in an awful peck of trouble, and--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Who_ is?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you'd take your\r\nferryboat and go up there--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUp where? Where are they?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the wreck.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat wreck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, there ain't but one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat, you don't mean the Walter Scott?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood land! what are they doin' _there_, for gracious sakes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, they didn't go there a-purpose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI bet they didn't! Why, great goodness, there ain't no chance for 'em\r\nif they don't git off mighty quick! Why, how in the nation did they\r\never git into such a scrape?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEasy enough. Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Booth's Landing--go on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was a-visiting there at Booth's Landing, and just in the edge of\r\nthe evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry\r\nto stay all night at her friend's house, Miss What-you-may-call-her I\r\ndisremember her name--and they lost their steering-oar, and swung\r\naround and went a-floating down, stern first, about two mile, and\r\nsaddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferryman and the nigger woman and\r\nthe horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard\r\nthe wreck. Well, about an hour after dark we come along down in our\r\ntrading-scow, and it was so dark we didn't notice the wreck till we was\r\nright on it; and so _we_ saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved but\r\nBill Whipple--and oh, he _was_ the best cretur!--I most wish 't it had\r\nbeen me, I do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy George! It's the beatenest thing I ever struck. And _then_ what\r\ndid you all do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we hollered and took on, but it's so wide there we couldn't\r\nmake nobody hear. So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help\r\nsomehow. I was the only one that could swim, so I made a dash for it,\r\nand Miss Hooker she said if I didn't strike help sooner, come here and\r\nhunt up her uncle, and he'd fix the thing. I made the land about a mile\r\nbelow, and been fooling along ever since, trying to get people to do\r\nsomething, but they said, 'What, in such a night and such a current?\r\nThere ain't no sense in it; go for the steam ferry.' Now if you'll go\r\nand--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy Jackson, I'd _like_ to, and, blame it, I don't know but I will; but\r\nwho in the dingnation's a-going' to _pay_ for it? Do you reckon your\r\npap--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy _that's_ all right. Miss Hooker she tole me, _particular_, that\r\nher uncle Hornback--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGreat guns! is _he_ her uncle? Looky here, you break for that light\r\nover yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and about a\r\nquarter of a mile out you'll come to the tavern; tell 'em to dart you\r\nout to Jim Hornback's, and he'll foot the bill. And don't you fool\r\naround any, because he'll want to know the news. Tell him I'll have\r\nhis niece all safe before he can get to town. Hump yourself, now; I'm\r\na-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer.\u201d\r\n\r\nI struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went back\r\nand got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore in\r\nthe easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among\r\nsome woodboats; for I couldn't rest easy till I could see the ferryboat\r\nstart. But take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on\r\naccounts of taking all this trouble for that gang, for not many would\r\na done it. I wished the widow knowed about it. I judged she would be\r\nproud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions and\r\ndead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest\r\nin.\r\n\r\nWell, before long here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding along\r\ndown! A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out for\r\nher. She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn't much chance\r\nfor anybody being alive in her. I pulled all around her and hollered\r\na little, but there wasn't any answer; all dead still. I felt a little\r\nbit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if they\r\ncould stand it I could.\r\n\r\nThen here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the middle of the river\r\non a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach\r\nI laid on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around the\r\nwreck for Miss Hooker's remainders, because the captain would know her\r\nuncle Hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give\r\nit up and went for the shore, and I laid into my work and went a-booming\r\ndown the river.\r\n\r\nIt did seem a powerful long time before Jim's light showed up; and when\r\nit did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off. By the time I\r\ngot there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east; so we\r\nstruck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turned\r\nin and slept like dead people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole\r\noff of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and all\r\nsorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and three\r\nboxes of seegars. We hadn't ever been this rich before in neither of\r\nour lives. The seegars was prime. We laid off all the afternoon in the\r\nwoods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good\r\ntime. I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the\r\nferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he said\r\nhe didn't want no more adventures. He said that when I went in the\r\ntexas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he\r\nnearly died, because he judged it was all up with _him_ anyway it could\r\nbe fixed; for if he didn't get saved he would get drownded; and if he\r\ndid get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get\r\nthe reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South, sure. Well, he\r\nwas right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head for a\r\nnigger.\r\n\r\nI read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such, and\r\nhow gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called each\r\nother your majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on, 'stead\r\nof mister; and Jim's eyes bugged out, and he was interested. He says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn' know dey was so many un um. I hain't hearn 'bout none un um,\r\nskasely, but ole King Sollermun, onless you counts dem kings dat's in a\r\npack er k'yards. How much do a king git?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGet?\u201d I says; \u201cwhy, they get a thousand dollars a month if they want\r\nit; they can have just as much as they want; everything belongs to\r\nthem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Ain'_ dat gay? En what dey got to do, Huck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_They_ don't do nothing! Why, how you talk! They just set around.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; is dat so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course it is. They just set around--except, maybe, when there's a\r\nwar; then they go to the war. But other times they just lazy around; or\r\ngo hawking--just hawking and sp--Sh!--d' you hear a noise?\u201d\r\n\r\nWe skipped out and looked; but it warn't nothing but the flutter of a\r\nsteamboat's wheel away down, coming around the point; so we come back.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d says I, \u201cand other times, when things is dull, they fuss with the\r\nparlyment; and if everybody don't go just so he whacks their heads off.\r\nBut mostly they hang round the harem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRoun' de which?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHarem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat's de harem?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe place where he keeps his wives. Don't you know about the harem?\r\nSolomon had one; he had about a million wives.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, yes, dat's so; I--I'd done forgot it. A harem's a bo'd'n-house, I\r\nreck'n. Mos' likely dey has rackety times in de nussery. En I reck'n\r\nde wives quarrels considable; en dat 'crease de racket. Yit dey say\r\nSollermun de wises' man dat ever live'. I doan' take no stock in\r\ndat. Bekase why: would a wise man want to live in de mids' er sich a\r\nblim-blammin' all de time? No--'deed he wouldn't. A wise man 'ud take\r\nen buil' a biler-factry; en den he could shet _down_ de biler-factry\r\nwhen he want to res'.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, but he _was_ the wisest man, anyway; because the widow she told\r\nme so, her own self.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI doan k'yer what de widder say, he _warn't_ no wise man nuther. He\r\nhad some er de dad-fetchedes' ways I ever see. Does you know 'bout dat\r\nchile dat he 'uz gwyne to chop in two?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, the widow told me all about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Well_, den! Warn' dat de beatenes' notion in de worl'? You jes'\r\ntake en look at it a minute. Dah's de stump, dah--dat's one er de women;\r\nheah's you--dat's de yuther one; I's Sollermun; en dish yer dollar bill's\r\nde chile. Bofe un you claims it. What does I do? Does I shin aroun'\r\nmongs' de neighbors en fine out which un you de bill _do_ b'long to, en\r\nhan' it over to de right one, all safe en soun', de way dat anybody dat\r\nhad any gumption would? No; I take en whack de bill in _two_, en give\r\nhalf un it to you, en de yuther half to de yuther woman. Dat's de way\r\nSollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile. Now I want to ast you: what's\r\nde use er dat half a bill?--can't buy noth'n wid it. En what use is a\r\nhalf a chile? I wouldn' give a dern for a million un um.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut hang it, Jim, you've clean missed the point--blame it, you've missed\r\nit a thousand mile.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho? Me? Go 'long. Doan' talk to me 'bout yo' pints. I reck'n I\r\nknows sense when I sees it; en dey ain' no sense in sich doin's as\r\ndat. De 'spute warn't 'bout a half a chile, de 'spute was 'bout a whole\r\nchile; en de man dat think he kin settle a 'spute 'bout a whole chile\r\nwid a half a chile doan' know enough to come in out'n de rain. Doan'\r\ntalk to me 'bout Sollermun, Huck, I knows him by de back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I tell you you don't get the point.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBlame de point! I reck'n I knows what I knows. En mine you, de _real_\r\npint is down furder--it's down deeper. It lays in de way Sollermun was\r\nraised. You take a man dat's got on'y one or two chillen; is dat man\r\ngwyne to be waseful o' chillen? No, he ain't; he can't 'ford it. _He_\r\nknow how to value 'em. But you take a man dat's got 'bout five million\r\nchillen runnin' roun' de house, en it's diffunt. _He_ as soon chop a\r\nchile in two as a cat. Dey's plenty mo'. A chile er two, mo' er less,\r\nwarn't no consekens to Sollermun, dad fatch him!\u201d\r\n\r\nI never see such a nigger. If he got a notion in his head once, there\r\nwarn't no getting it out again. He was the most down on Solomon of\r\nany nigger I ever see. So I went to talking about other kings, and let\r\nSolomon slide. I told about Louis Sixteenth that got his head cut off\r\nin France long time ago; and about his little boy the dolphin, that\r\nwould a been a king, but they took and shut him up in jail, and some say\r\nhe died there.\r\n\r\n\u201cPo' little chap.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut some says he got out and got away, and come to America.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDat's good! But he'll be pooty lonesome--dey ain' no kings here, is\r\ndey, Huck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDen he cain't git no situation. What he gwyne to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don't know. Some of them gets on the police, and some of them\r\nlearns people how to talk French.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Huck, doan' de French people talk de same way we does?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_No_, Jim; you couldn't understand a word they said--not a single word.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, now, I be ding-busted! How do dat come?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't know; but it's so. I got some of their jabber out of a book.\r\nS'pose a man was to come to you and say Polly-voo-franzy--what would you\r\nthink?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wouldn' think nuff'n; I'd take en bust him over de head--dat is, if he\r\nwarn't white. I wouldn't 'low no nigger to call me dat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShucks, it ain't calling you anything. It's only saying, do you know\r\nhow to talk French?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, den, why couldn't he _say_ it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, he _is_ a-saying it. That's a Frenchman's _way_ of saying it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it's a blame ridicklous way, en I doan' want to hear no mo' 'bout\r\nit. Dey ain' no sense in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLooky here, Jim; does a cat talk like we do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, a cat don't.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, does a cow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, a cow don't, nuther.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes a cat talk like a cow, or a cow talk like a cat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, dey don't.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other, ain't\r\nit?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCourse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd ain't it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk different\r\nfrom _us_?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, mos' sholy it is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, why ain't it natural and right for a _Frenchman_ to talk\r\ndifferent from us? You answer me that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs a cat a man, Huck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, den, dey ain't no sense in a cat talkin' like a man. Is a cow a\r\nman?--er is a cow a cat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, she ain't either of them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, den, she ain't got no business to talk like either one er the\r\nyuther of 'em. Is a Frenchman a man?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Well_, den! Dad blame it, why doan' he _talk_ like a man? You answer\r\nme _dat_!\u201d\r\n\r\nI see it warn't no use wasting words--you can't learn a nigger to argue.\r\nSo I quit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the bottom\r\nof Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that was what we was\r\nafter. We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the\r\nOhio amongst the free States, and then be out of trouble.\r\n\r\nWell, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a towhead\r\nto tie to, for it wouldn't do to try to run in a fog; but when I paddled\r\nahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there warn't anything\r\nbut little saplings to tie to. I passed the line around one of them\r\nright on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current, and\r\nthe raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and\r\naway she went. I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and\r\nscared I couldn't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me--and\r\nthen there warn't no raft in sight; you couldn't see twenty yards. I\r\njumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the paddle\r\nand set her back a stroke. But she didn't come. I was in such a hurry\r\nI hadn't untied her. I got up and tried to untie her, but I was so\r\nexcited my hands shook so I couldn't hardly do anything with them.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, right\r\ndown the towhead. That was all right as far as it went, but the towhead\r\nwarn't sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot\r\nout into the solid white fog, and hadn't no more idea which way I was\r\ngoing than a dead man.\r\n\r\nThinks I, it won't do to paddle; first I know I'll run into the bank\r\nor a towhead or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it's\r\nmighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time.\r\nI whooped and listened. Away down there somewheres I hears a small\r\nwhoop, and up comes my spirits. I went tearing after it, listening\r\nsharp to hear it again. The next time it come I see I warn't heading\r\nfor it, but heading away to the right of it. And the next time I was\r\nheading away to the left of it--and not gaining on it much either, for\r\nI was flying around, this way and that and t'other, but it was going\r\nstraight ahead all the time.\r\n\r\nI did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the\r\ntime, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops\r\nthat was making the trouble for me. Well, I fought along, and directly\r\nI hears the whoop _behind_ me. I was tangled good now. That was\r\nsomebody else's whoop, or else I was turned around.\r\n\r\nI throwed the paddle down. I heard the whoop again; it was behind me\r\nyet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its\r\nplace, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me again,\r\nand I knowed the current had swung the canoe's head down-stream, and I\r\nwas all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering.\r\nI couldn't tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don't look\r\nnatural nor sound natural in a fog.\r\n\r\nThe whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a\r\ncut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed\r\nme off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly\r\nroared, the currrent was tearing by them so swift.\r\n\r\nIn another second or two it was solid white and still again. I set\r\nperfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn't\r\ndraw a breath while it thumped a hundred.\r\n\r\nI just give up then. I knowed what the matter was. That cut bank\r\nwas an island, and Jim had gone down t'other side of it. It warn't no\r\ntowhead that you could float by in ten minutes. It had the big timber\r\nof a regular island; it might be five or six miles long and more than\r\nhalf a mile wide.\r\n\r\nI kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon. I\r\nwas floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don't\r\never think of that. No, you _feel_ like you are laying dead still on\r\nthe water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don't think to\r\nyourself how fast _you're_ going, but you catch your breath and think,\r\nmy! how that snag's tearing along. If you think it ain't dismal and\r\nlonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it\r\nonce--you'll see.\r\n\r\nNext, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears\r\nthe answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn't do\r\nit, and directly I judged I'd got into a nest of towheads, for I had\r\nlittle dim glimpses of them on both sides of me--sometimes just a narrow\r\nchannel between, and some that I couldn't see I knowed was there because\r\nI'd hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash\r\nthat hung over the banks. Well, I warn't long loosing the whoops down\r\namongst the towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little while,\r\nanyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o'-lantern. You never\r\nknowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.\r\n\r\nI had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to\r\nkeep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the\r\nraft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would\r\nget further ahead and clear out of hearing--it was floating a little\r\nfaster than what I was.\r\n\r\nWell, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn't\r\nhear no sign of a whoop nowheres. I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a\r\nsnag, maybe, and it was all up with him. I was good and tired, so I\r\nlaid down in the canoe and said I wouldn't bother no more. I didn't\r\nwant to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn't help it;\r\nso I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap.\r\n\r\nBut I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars\r\nwas shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a\r\nbig bend stern first. First I didn't know where I was; I thought I was\r\ndreaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come\r\nup dim out of last week.\r\n\r\nIt was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest\r\nkind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see\r\nby the stars. I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the\r\nwater. I took after it; but when I got to it it warn't nothing but a\r\ncouple of sawlogs made fast together. Then I see another speck, and\r\nchased that; then another, and this time I was right. It was the raft.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his\r\nknees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar. The\r\nother oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and\r\nbranches and dirt. So she'd had a rough time.\r\n\r\nI made fast and laid down under Jim's nose on the raft, and began to\r\ngap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHello, Jim, have I been asleep? Why didn't you stir me up?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGoodness gracious, is dat you, Huck? En you ain' dead--you ain'\r\ndrownded--you's back agin? It's too good for true, honey, it's too good\r\nfor true. Lemme look at you chile, lemme feel o' you. No, you ain'\r\ndead! you's back agin, 'live en soun', jis de same ole Huck--de same ole\r\nHuck, thanks to goodness!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat's the matter with you, Jim? You been a-drinking?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDrinkin'? Has I ben a-drinkin'? Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin'?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, what makes you talk so wild?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow does I talk wild?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_How_? Why, hain't you been talking about my coming back, and all that\r\nstuff, as if I'd been gone away?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHuck--Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye. _Hain't_ you\r\nben gone away?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGone away? Why, what in the nation do you mean? I hain't been gone\r\nanywheres. Where would I go to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, looky here, boss, dey's sumf'n wrong, dey is. Is I _me_, or who\r\n_is_ I? Is I heah, or whah _is_ I? Now dat's what I wants to know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I think you're here, plain enough, but I think you're a\r\ntangle-headed old fool, Jim.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI is, is I? Well, you answer me dis: Didn't you tote out de line in\r\nde canoe fer to make fas' to de tow-head?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I didn't. What tow-head? I hain't see no tow-head.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou hain't seen no towhead? Looky here, didn't de line pull loose en\r\nde raf' go a-hummin' down de river, en leave you en de canoe behine in\r\nde fog?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat fog?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, de fog!--de fog dat's been aroun' all night. En didn't you whoop,\r\nen didn't I whoop, tell we got mix' up in de islands en one un us got\r\nlos' en t'other one was jis' as good as los', 'kase he didn' know whah\r\nhe wuz? En didn't I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible\r\ntime en mos' git drownded? Now ain' dat so, boss--ain't it so? You\r\nanswer me dat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, this is too many for me, Jim. I hain't seen no fog, nor no\r\nislands, nor no troubles, nor nothing. I been setting here talking with\r\nyou all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I reckon\r\nI done the same. You couldn't a got drunk in that time, so of course\r\nyou've been dreaming.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn't any of it\r\nhappen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, Huck, it's all jis' as plain to me as--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt don't make no difference how plain it is; there ain't nothing in it.\r\nI know, because I've been here all the time.\u201d\r\n\r\nJim didn't say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studying\r\nover it. Then he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, den, I reck'n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain't\r\nde powerfullest dream I ever see. En I hain't ever had no dream b'fo'\r\ndat's tired me like dis one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, well, that's all right, because a dream does tire a body like\r\neverything sometimes. But this one was a staving dream; tell me all\r\nabout it, Jim.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as\r\nit happened, only he painted it up considerable. Then he said he must\r\nstart in and \u201c'terpret\u201d it, because it was sent for a warning. He said\r\nthe first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good, but\r\nthe current was another man that would get us away from him. The whoops\r\nwas warnings that would come to us every now and then, and if we didn't\r\ntry hard to make out to understand them they'd just take us into bad\r\nluck, 'stead of keeping us out of it. The lot of towheads was troubles\r\nwe was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean\r\nfolks, but if we minded our business and didn't talk back and aggravate\r\nthem, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big\r\nclear river, which was the free States, and wouldn't have no more\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nIt had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but it\r\nwas clearing up again now.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, well, that's all interpreted well enough as far as it goes, Jim,\u201d I\r\nsays; \u201cbut what does _these_ things stand for?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar. You\r\ncould see them first-rate now.\r\n\r\nJim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash\r\nagain. He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he\r\ncouldn't seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place\r\nagain right away. But when he did get the thing straightened around he\r\nlooked at me steady without ever smiling, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do dey stan' for? I'se gwyne to tell you. When I got all wore\r\nout wid work, en wid de callin' for you, en went to sleep, my heart wuz\r\nmos' broke bekase you wuz los', en I didn' k'yer no' mo' what become\r\ner me en de raf'. En when I wake up en fine you back agin, all safe\r\nen soun', de tears come, en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo'\r\nfoot, I's so thankful. En all you wuz thinkin' 'bout wuz how you could\r\nmake a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie. Dat truck dah is _trash_; en trash\r\nis what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren's en makes 'em\r\nashamed.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there without\r\nsaying anything but that. But that was enough. It made me feel so mean\r\nI could almost kissed _his_ foot to get him to take it back.\r\n\r\nIt was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble\r\nmyself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn't ever sorry for it\r\nafterwards, neither. I didn't do him no more mean tricks, and I\r\nwouldn't done that one if I'd a knowed it would make him feel that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a\r\nmonstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession. She had\r\nfour long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty\r\nmen, likely. She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open\r\ncamp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end. There was a\r\npower of style about her. It _amounted_ to something being a raftsman\r\non such a craft as that.\r\n\r\nWe went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got\r\nhot. The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on\r\nboth sides; you couldn't see a break in it hardly ever, or a light. We\r\ntalked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to\r\nit. I said likely we wouldn't, because I had heard say there warn't but\r\nabout a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happen to have them lit\r\nup, how was we going to know we was passing a town? Jim said if the two\r\nbig rivers joined together there, that would show. But I said maybe\r\nwe might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the\r\nsame old river again. That disturbed Jim--and me too. So the question\r\nwas, what to do? I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed,\r\nand tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and\r\nwas a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to\r\nCairo. Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and\r\nwaited.\r\n\r\nThere warn't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and\r\nnot pass it without seeing it. He said he'd be mighty sure to see it,\r\nbecause he'd be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it\r\nhe'd be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom. Every\r\nlittle while he jumps up and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDah she is?\u201d\r\n\r\nBut it warn't. It was Jack-o'-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set\r\ndown again, and went to watching, same as before. Jim said it made him\r\nall over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. Well, I can\r\ntell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him,\r\nbecause I begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free--and\r\nwho was to blame for it? Why, _me_. I couldn't get that out of my\r\nconscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn't\r\nrest; I couldn't stay still in one place. It hadn't ever come home to\r\nme before, what this thing was that I was doing. But now it did; and it\r\nstayed with me, and scorched me more and more. I tried to make out to\r\nmyself that I warn't to blame, because I didn't run Jim off from his\r\nrightful owner; but it warn't no use, conscience up and says, every\r\ntime, \u201cBut you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a\r\npaddled ashore and told somebody.\u201d That was so--I couldn't get around\r\nthat noway. That was where it pinched. Conscience says to me, \u201cWhat\r\nhad poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off\r\nright under your eyes and never say one single word? What did that poor\r\nold woman do to you that you could treat her so mean? Why, she tried to\r\nlearn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to\r\nbe good to you every way she knowed how. _That's_ what she done.\u201d\r\n\r\nI got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead. I\r\nfidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was\r\nfidgeting up and down past me. We neither of us could keep still.\r\nEvery time he danced around and says, \u201cDah's Cairo!\u201d it went through me\r\nlike a shot, and I thought if it _was_ Cairo I reckoned I would die of\r\nmiserableness.\r\n\r\nJim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. He was\r\nsaying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he\r\nwould go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he\r\ngot enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to\r\nwhere Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the\r\ntwo children, and if their master wouldn't sell them, they'd get an\r\nAb'litionist to go and steal them.\r\n\r\nIt most froze me to hear such talk. He wouldn't ever dared to talk such\r\ntalk in his life before. Just see what a difference it made in him the\r\nminute he judged he was about free. It was according to the old saying,\r\n\u201cGive a nigger an inch and he'll take an ell.\u201d Thinks I, this is what\r\ncomes of my not thinking. Here was this nigger, which I had as good\r\nas helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would\r\nsteal his children--children that belonged to a man I didn't even know; a\r\nman that hadn't ever done me no harm.\r\n\r\nI was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him. My\r\nconscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says\r\nto it, \u201cLet up on me--it ain't too late yet--I'll paddle ashore at the\r\nfirst light and tell.\u201d I felt easy and happy and light as a feather\r\nright off. All my troubles was gone. I went to looking out sharp for a\r\nlight, and sort of singing to myself. By and by one showed. Jim sings\r\nout:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe's safe, Huck, we's safe! Jump up and crack yo' heels! Dat's de\r\ngood ole Cairo at las', I jis knows it!\u201d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI'll take the canoe and go and see, Jim. It mightn't be, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom\r\nfor me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cPooty soon I'll be a-shout'n' for joy, en I'll say, it's all on\r\naccounts o' Huck; I's a free man, en I couldn't ever ben free ef it\r\nhadn' ben for Huck; Huck done it. Jim won't ever forgit you, Huck;\r\nyou's de bes' fren' Jim's ever had; en you's de _only_ fren' ole Jim's\r\ngot now.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says\r\nthis, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me. I went along\r\nslow then, and I warn't right down certain whether I was glad I started\r\nor whether I warn't. When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on'y white genlman dat ever kep' his\r\npromise to ole Jim.\u201d\r\n\r\nWell, I just felt sick. But I says, I _got_ to do it--I can't get _out_\r\nof it. Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, and\r\nthey stopped and I stopped. One of them says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat's that yonder?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA piece of a raft,\u201d I says.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you belong on it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAny men on it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly one, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there's five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the head\r\nof the bend. Is your man white or black?\u201d\r\n\r\nI didn't answer up prompt. I tried to, but the words wouldn't come. I\r\ntried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn't man\r\nenough--hadn't the spunk of a rabbit. I see I was weakening; so I just\r\ngive up trying, and up and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHe's white.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reckon we'll go and see for ourselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish you would,\u201d says I, \u201cbecause it's pap that's there, and maybe\r\nyou'd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is. He's sick--and so\r\nis mam and Mary Ann.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, the devil! we're in a hurry, boy. But I s'pose we've got to.\r\nCome, buckle to your paddle, and let's get along.\u201d\r\n\r\nI buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars. When we had made a\r\nstroke or two, I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cPap'll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you. Everybody goes\r\naway when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can't do it\r\nby myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that's infernal mean. Odd, too. Say, boy, what's the matter\r\nwith your father?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's the--a--the--well, it ain't anything much.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey stopped pulling. It warn't but a mighty little ways to the raft\r\nnow. One says:\r\n\r\n\u201cBoy, that's a lie. What _is_ the matter with your pap? Answer up\r\nsquare now, and it'll be the better for you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will, sir, I will, honest--but don't leave us, please. It's\r\nthe--the--Gentlemen, if you'll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the\r\nheadline, you won't have to come a-near the raft--please do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSet her back, John, set her back!\u201d says one. They backed water.  \u201cKeep\r\naway, boy--keep to looard. Confound it, I just expect the wind has\r\nblowed it to us. Your pap's got the small-pox, and you know it precious\r\nwell. Why didn't you come out and say so? Do you want to spread it all\r\nover?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d says I, a-blubbering, \u201cI've told everybody before, and they just\r\nwent away and left us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor devil, there's something in that. We are right down sorry for\r\nyou, but we--well, hang it, we don't want the small-pox, you see. Look\r\nhere, I'll tell you what to do. Don't you try to land by yourself, or\r\nyou'll smash everything to pieces. You float along down about twenty\r\nmiles, and you'll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river. It\r\nwill be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them\r\nyour folks are all down with chills and fever. Don't be a fool again,\r\nand let people guess what is the matter. Now we're trying to do you a\r\nkindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that's a good boy.\r\nIt wouldn't do any good to land yonder where the light is--it's only a\r\nwood-yard. Say, I reckon your father's poor, and I'm bound to say he's\r\nin pretty hard luck. Here, I'll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this\r\nboard, and you get it when it floats by. I feel mighty mean to leave\r\nyou; but my kingdom! it won't do to fool with small-pox, don't you see?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHold on, Parker,\u201d says the other man, \u201chere's a twenty to put on the\r\nboard for me. Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you'll\r\nbe all right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat's so, my boy--good-bye, good-bye. If you see any runaway niggers\r\nyou get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-bye, sir,\u201d says I; \u201cI won't let no runaway niggers get by me if I\r\ncan help it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I\r\nknowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn't no use for me\r\nto try to learn to do right; a body that don't get _started_ right when\r\nhe's little ain't got no show--when the pinch comes there ain't nothing\r\nto back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat. Then I\r\nthought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s'pose you'd a done right\r\nand give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now? No, says\r\nI, I'd feel bad--I'd feel just the same way I do now. Well, then, says\r\nI, what's the use you learning to do right when it's troublesome to do\r\nright and ain't no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same?\r\nI was stuck. I couldn't answer that. So I reckoned I wouldn't bother\r\nno more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest at\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nI went into the wigwam; Jim warn't there. I looked all around; he\r\nwarn't anywhere. I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cJim!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere I is, Huck. Is dey out o' sight yit? Don't talk loud.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out. I told\r\nhim they were out of sight, so he come aboard. He says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI was a-listenin' to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was gwyne\r\nto shove for sho' if dey come aboard. Den I was gwyne to swim to de\r\nraf' agin when dey was gone. But lawsy, how you did fool 'em, Huck!\r\nDat _wuz_ de smartes' dodge! I tell you, chile, I'spec it save' ole\r\nJim--ole Jim ain't going to forgit you for dat, honey.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen we talked about the money. It was a pretty good raise--twenty\r\ndollars apiece. Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat\r\nnow, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free\r\nStates. He said twenty mile more warn't far for the raft to go, but he\r\nwished we was already there.\r\n\r\nTowards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding\r\nthe raft good. Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and\r\ngetting all ready to quit rafting.\r\n\r\nThat night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down\r\nin a left-hand bend.\r\n\r\nI went off in the canoe to ask about it. Pretty soon I found a man out\r\nin the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line. I ranged up and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cMister, is that town Cairo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCairo? no. You must be a blame' fool.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat town is it, mister?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you want to know, go and find out. If you stay here botherin'\r\naround me for about a half a minute longer you'll get something you\r\nwon't want.\u201d\r\n\r\nI paddled to the raft. Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never\r\nmind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.\r\n\r\nWe passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but\r\nit was high ground, so I didn't go. No high ground about Cairo, Jim\r\nsaid. I had forgot it. We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable\r\nclose to the left-hand bank. I begun to suspicion something. So did\r\nJim. I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDoan' le's talk about it, Huck. Po' niggers can't have no luck. I\r\nawluz 'spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn't done wid its work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish I'd never seen that snake-skin, Jim--I do wish I'd never laid\r\neyes on it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt ain't yo' fault, Huck; you didn' know. Don't you blame yo'self\r\n'bout it.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure\r\nenough, and outside was the old regular Muddy! So it was all up with\r\nCairo.\r\n\r\nWe talked it all over. It wouldn't do to take to the shore; we couldn't\r\ntake the raft up the stream, of course. There warn't no way but to wait\r\nfor dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances. So we slept\r\nall day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work,\r\nand when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone!\r\n\r\nWe didn't say a word for a good while. There warn't anything to\r\nsay. We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the\r\nrattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it? It would only\r\nlook like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more\r\nbad luck--and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nBy and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn't no\r\nway but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy\r\na canoe to go back in. We warn't going to borrow it when there warn't\r\nanybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after\r\nus.\r\n\r\nSo we shoved out after dark on the raft.\r\n\r\nAnybody that don't believe yet that it's foolishness to handle a\r\nsnake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it\r\nnow if they read on and see what more it done for us.\r\n\r\nThe place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore. But we\r\ndidn't see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and\r\nmore. Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next\r\nmeanest thing to fog. You can't tell the shape of the river, and you\r\ncan't see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along\r\ncomes a steamboat up the river. We lit the lantern, and judged she\r\nwould see it. Up-stream boats didn't generly come close to us; they\r\ngo out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but\r\nnights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.\r\n\r\nWe could hear her pounding along, but we didn't see her good till she\r\nwas close. She aimed right for us. Often they do that and try to see\r\nhow close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off\r\na sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks\r\nhe's mighty smart. Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to\r\ntry and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit. She\r\nwas a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black\r\ncloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged\r\nout, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining\r\nlike red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right\r\nover us. There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the\r\nengines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as Jim went\r\noverboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight\r\nthrough the raft.\r\n\r\nI dived--and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel\r\nhad got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room. I could\r\nalways stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a\r\nminute and a half. Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was\r\nnearly busting. I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of\r\nmy nose, and puffed a bit. Of course there was a booming current; and\r\nof course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she\r\nstopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was\r\nchurning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I\r\ncould hear her.\r\n\r\nI sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn't get any answer;\r\nso I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was \u201ctreading water,\u201d and\r\nstruck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me. But I made out to see\r\nthat the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which\r\nmeant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.\r\n\r\nIt was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good\r\nlong time in getting over. I made a safe landing, and clumb up the\r\nbank. I couldn't see but a little ways, but I went poking along over\r\nrough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a\r\nbig old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it. I was going to\r\nrush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling\r\nand barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his\r\nhead out, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cBe done, boys! Who's there?\u201d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho's me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGeorge Jackson, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't want nothing, sir. I only want to go along by, but the dogs\r\nwon't let me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you prowling around here this time of night for--hey?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI warn't prowling around, sir, I fell overboard off of the steamboat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you did, did you? Strike a light there, somebody. What did you\r\nsay your name was?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGeorge Jackson, sir. I'm only a boy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, if you're telling the truth you needn't be afraid--nobody'll\r\nhurt you. But don't try to budge; stand right where you are. Rouse out\r\nBob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns. George Jackson, is there\r\nanybody with you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, nobody.\u201d\r\n\r\nI heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light.\r\nThe man sung out:\r\n\r\n\u201cSnatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool--ain't you got any sense?\r\nPut it on the floor behind the front door. Bob, if you and Tom are\r\nready, take your places.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll ready.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir; I never heard of them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that may be so, and it mayn't. Now, all ready. Step forward,\r\nGeorge Jackson. And mind, don't you hurry--come mighty slow. If there's\r\nanybody with you, let him keep back--if he shows himself he'll be shot.\r\nCome along now. Come slow; push the door open yourself--just enough to\r\nsqueeze in, d' you hear?\u201d\r\n\r\nI didn't hurry; I couldn't if I'd a wanted to. I took one slow step at\r\na time and there warn't a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart.\r\nThe dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behind\r\nme. When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and\r\nunbarring and unbolting. I put my hand on the door and pushed it a\r\nlittle and a little more till somebody said, \u201cThere, that's enough--put\r\nyour head in.\u201d I done it, but I judged they would take it off.\r\n\r\nThe candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, and\r\nme at them, for about a quarter of a minute: Three big men with guns\r\npointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray\r\nand about sixty, the other two thirty or more--all of them fine and\r\nhandsome--and the sweetest old gray-headed lady, and back of her two\r\nyoung women which I couldn't see right well. The old gentleman says:\r\n\r\n\u201cThere; I reckon it's all right. Come in.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it\r\nand bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and\r\nthey all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor,\r\nand got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front\r\nwindows--there warn't none on the side. They held the candle, and took a\r\ngood look at me, and all said, \u201cWhy, _he_ ain't a Shepherdson--no, there\r\nain't any Shepherdson about him.\u201d Then the old man said he hoped I\r\nwouldn't mind being searched for arms, because he didn't mean no harm by\r\nit--it was only to make sure. So he didn't pry into my pockets, but only\r\nfelt outside with his hands, and said it was all right. He told me to\r\nmake myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but the old\r\nlady says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, bless you, Saul, the poor thing's as wet as he can be; and don't\r\nyou reckon it may be he's hungry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue for you, Rachel--I forgot.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the old lady says:\r\n\r\n\u201cBetsy\u201d (this was a nigger woman), \u201cyou fly around and get him something\r\nto eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you girls go and wake\r\nup Buck and tell him--oh, here he is himself. Buck, take this little\r\nstranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some\r\nof yours that's dry.\u201d\r\n\r\nBuck looked about as old as me--thirteen or fourteen or along there,\r\nthough he was a little bigger than me. He hadn't on anything but a\r\nshirt, and he was very frowzy-headed. He came in gaping and digging one\r\nfist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the other one.\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n\u201cAin't they no Shepherdsons around?\u201d\r\n\r\nThey said, no, 'twas a false alarm.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cif they'd a ben some, I reckon I'd a got one.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey all laughed, and Bob says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you've been so slow in\r\ncoming.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, nobody come after me, and it ain't right I'm always kept down; I\r\ndon't get no show.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind, Buck, my boy,\u201d says the old man, \u201cyou'll have show enough,\r\nall in good time, don't you fret about that. Go 'long with you now, and\r\ndo as your mother told you.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a\r\nroundabout and pants of his, and I put them on. While I was at it he\r\nasked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he started to\r\ntell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods\r\nday before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candle\r\nwent out. I said I didn't know; I hadn't heard about it before, no way.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, guess,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow'm I going to guess,\u201d says I, \u201cwhen I never heard tell of it\r\nbefore?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you can guess, can't you? It's just as easy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Which_ candle?\u201d I says.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, any candle,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't know where he was,\u201d says I; \u201cwhere was he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, he was in the _dark_! That's where he was!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, blame it, it's a riddle, don't you see? Say, how long are you\r\ngoing to stay here? You got to stay always. We can just have booming\r\ntimes--they don't have no school now. Do you own a dog? I've got a\r\ndog--and he'll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in. Do\r\nyou like to comb up Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness? You bet\r\nI don't, but ma she makes me. Confound these ole britches! I reckon\r\nI'd better put 'em on, but I'd ruther not, it's so warm. Are you all\r\nready? All right. Come along, old hoss.\u201d\r\n\r\nCold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk--that is what they\r\nhad for me down there, and there ain't nothing better that ever I've\r\ncome across yet. Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes,\r\nexcept the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women. They\r\nall smoked and talked, and I eat and talked. The young women had\r\nquilts around them, and their hair down their backs. They all asked me\r\nquestions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living\r\non a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann\r\nrun off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went\r\nto hunt them and he warn't heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died,\r\nand then there warn't nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just\r\ntrimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died\r\nI took what there was left, because the farm didn't belong to us, and\r\nstarted up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how\r\nI come to be here. So they said I could have a home there as long as I\r\nwanted it. Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I\r\nwent to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all,\r\nI had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an hour trying to\r\nthink, and when Buck waked up I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you spell, Buck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\n\u201cI bet you can't spell my name,\u201d says I.\r\n\r\n\u201cI bet you what you dare I can,\u201d says he.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d says I, \u201cgo ahead.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cG-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n--there now,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d says I, \u201cyou done it, but I didn't think you could. It ain't no\r\nslouch of a name to spell--right off without studying.\u201d\r\n\r\nI set it down, private, because somebody might want _me_ to spell it\r\nnext, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was\r\nused to it.\r\n\r\nIt was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too. I hadn't\r\nseen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much\r\nstyle. It didn't have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one\r\nwith a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in\r\ntown. There warn't no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps\r\nof parlors in towns has beds in them. There was a big fireplace that\r\nwas bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by\r\npouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes\r\nthey wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown,\r\nsame as they do in town. They had big brass dog-irons that could hold\r\nup a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with\r\na picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and\r\na round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the\r\npendulum swinging behind it. It was beautiful to hear that clock tick;\r\nand sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her\r\nup and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred\r\nand fifty before she got tuckered out. They wouldn't took any money for\r\nher.\r\n\r\nWell, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock,\r\nmade out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy. By one of the\r\nparrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other;\r\nand when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open\r\ntheir mouths nor look different nor interested. They squeaked through\r\nunderneath. There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out\r\nbehind those things. On the table in the middle of the room was a kind\r\nof a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and\r\ngrapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier\r\nthan real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where\r\npieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it\r\nwas, underneath.\r\n\r\nThis table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and\r\nblue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around. It\r\ncome all the way from Philadelphia, they said. There was some books,\r\ntoo, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table. One was a\r\nbig family Bible full of pictures. One was Pilgrim's Progress, about a\r\nman that left his family, it didn't say why. I read considerable in it\r\nnow and then. The statements was interesting, but tough. Another was\r\nFriendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn't\r\nread the poetry. Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr.\r\nGunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body\r\nwas sick or dead. There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books. And\r\nthere was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged\r\ndown in the middle and busted, like an old basket.\r\n\r\nThey had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes,\r\nand battles, and Highland Marys, and one called \u201cSigning the\r\nDeclaration.\u201d There was some that they called crayons, which one of the\r\ndaughters which was dead made her own self when she was only\r\nfifteen years old. They was different from any pictures I ever see\r\nbefore--blacker, mostly, than is common. One was a woman in a slim black\r\ndress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in\r\nthe middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with\r\na black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and\r\nvery wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a\r\ntombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand\r\nhanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,\r\nand underneath the picture it said \u201cShall I Never See Thee More Alas.\u201d\r\n Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight\r\nto the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a\r\nchair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird\r\nlaying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath\r\nthe picture it said \u201cI Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.\u201d\r\n There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the\r\nmoon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in\r\none hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was\r\nmashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath\r\nthe picture it said \u201cAnd Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.\u201d These\r\nwas all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take\r\nto them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the\r\nfan-tods. Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot\r\nmore of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done\r\nwhat they had lost. But I reckoned that with her disposition she was\r\nhaving a better time in the graveyard. She was at work on what they\r\nsaid was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and\r\nevery night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it\r\ndone, but she never got the chance. It was a picture of a young woman\r\nin a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump\r\noff, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with\r\nthe tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her\r\nbreast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up\r\ntowards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best,\r\nand then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died\r\nbefore she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the\r\nhead of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung\r\nflowers on it. Other times it was hid with a little curtain. The young\r\nwoman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so\r\nmany arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.\r\n\r\nThis young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste\r\nobituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the\r\nPresbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head.\r\nIt was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name\r\nof Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:\r\n\r\nODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC'D\r\n\r\nAnd did young Stephen sicken,  And did young Stephen die? And did the\r\nsad hearts thicken,  And did the mourners cry?\r\n\r\nNo; such was not the fate of  Young Stephen Dowling Bots; Though sad\r\nhearts round him thickened,   'Twas not from sickness' shots.\r\n\r\nNo whooping-cough did rack his frame,  Nor measles drear with spots;\r\nNot these impaired the sacred name  Of Stephen Dowling Bots.\r\n\r\nDespised love struck not with woe  That head of curly knots, Nor\r\nstomach troubles laid him low,  Young Stephen Dowling Bots.\r\n\r\nO no. Then list with tearful eye,  Whilst I his fate do tell. His soul\r\ndid from this cold world fly  By falling down a well.\r\n\r\nThey got him out and emptied him;  Alas it was too late; His spirit\r\nwas gone for to sport aloft  In the realms of the good and great.\r\n\r\nIf Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was\r\nfourteen, there ain't no telling what she could a done by and by. Buck\r\nsaid she could rattle off poetry like nothing. She didn't ever have to\r\nstop to think. He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn't\r\nfind anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down\r\nanother one, and go ahead. She warn't particular; she could write about\r\nanything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful.\r\nEvery time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on\r\nhand with her \u201ctribute\u201d before he was cold. She called them tributes.\r\nThe neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the\r\nundertaker--the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and\r\nthen she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person's name, which was\r\nWhistler. She warn't ever the same after that; she never complained,\r\nbut she kinder pined away and did not live long. Poor thing, many's the\r\ntime I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get\r\nout her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been\r\naggravating me and I had soured on her a little. I liked all that\r\nfamily, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let anything come between\r\nus. Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was\r\nalive, and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make some\r\nabout her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two\r\nmyself, but I couldn't seem to make it go somehow. They kept Emmeline's\r\nroom trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she\r\nliked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there.\r\nThe old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty\r\nof niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there\r\nmostly.\r\n\r\nWell, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on\r\nthe windows: white, with pictures painted on them of castles with vines\r\nall down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink. There was a little\r\nold piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever\r\nso lovely as to hear the young ladies sing \u201cThe Last Link is Broken\u201d\r\n and play \u201cThe Battle of Prague\u201d on it. The walls of all the rooms was\r\nplastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was\r\nwhitewashed on the outside.\r\n\r\nIt was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed\r\nand floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the\r\nday, and it was a cool, comfortable place. Nothing couldn't be better.\r\nAnd warn't the cooking good, and just bushels of it too!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nCol. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see. He was a gentleman all\r\nover; and so was his family. He was well born, as the saying is, and\r\nthat's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas\r\nsaid, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy\r\nin our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn't no more\r\nquality than a mudcat himself. Col. Grangerford was very tall and\r\nvery slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it\r\nanywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and\r\nhe had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and\r\na high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so\r\ndeep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at\r\nyou, as you may say. His forehead was high, and his hair was black and\r\nstraight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and\r\nevery day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head\r\nto foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it;\r\nand on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it. He\r\ncarried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn't no\r\nfrivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud. He was\r\nas kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you had\r\nconfidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he\r\nstraightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to\r\nflicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first,\r\nand find out what the matter was afterwards. He didn't ever have to\r\ntell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was always good-mannered\r\nwhere he was. Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine\r\nmost always--I mean he made it seem like good weather. When he turned\r\ninto a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was\r\nenough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week.\r\n\r\nWhen him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got\r\nup out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn't set down again\r\ntill they had set down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where\r\nthe decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and\r\nhe held it in his hand and waited till Tom's and Bob's was mixed, and\r\nthen they bowed and said, \u201cOur duty to you, sir, and madam;\u201d and _they_\r\nbowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank,\r\nall three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and\r\nthe mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and\r\ngive it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.\r\n\r\nBob was the oldest and Tom next--tall, beautiful men with very broad\r\nshoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes. They\r\ndressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and\r\nwore broad Panama hats.\r\n\r\nThen there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud\r\nand grand, but as good as she could be when she warn't stirred up; but\r\nwhen she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks,\r\nlike her father. She was beautiful.\r\n\r\nSo was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind. She was\r\ngentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.\r\n\r\nEach person had their own nigger to wait on them--Buck too. My nigger\r\nhad a monstrous easy time, because I warn't used to having anybody do\r\nanything for me, but Buck's was on the jump most of the time.\r\n\r\nThis was all there was of the family now, but there used to be\r\nmore--three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers.\r\nSometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or\r\nfifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings\r\nround about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods\r\ndaytimes, and balls at the house nights. These people was mostly\r\nkinfolks of the family. The men brought their guns with them. It was a\r\nhandsome lot of quality, I tell you.\r\n\r\nThere was another clan of aristocracy around there--five or six\r\nfamilies--mostly of the name of Shepherdson. They was as high-toned\r\nand well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords. The\r\nShepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing, which was\r\nabout two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a\r\nlot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their\r\nfine horses.\r\n\r\nOne day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse\r\ncoming. We was crossing the road. Buck says:\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick! Jump for the woods!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves. Pretty\r\nsoon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his\r\nhorse easy and looking like a soldier. He had his gun across his\r\npommel. I had seen him before. It was young Harney Shepherdson. I\r\nheard Buck's gun go off at my ear, and Harney's hat tumbled off from his\r\nhead. He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was\r\nhid. But we didn't wait. We started through the woods on a run. The\r\nwoods warn't thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet,\r\nand twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away\r\nthe way he come--to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn't see. We never\r\nstopped running till we got home. The old gentleman's eyes blazed a\r\nminute--'twas pleasure, mainly, I judged--then his face sort of smoothed\r\ndown, and he says, kind of gentle:\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't like that shooting from behind a bush. Why didn't you step\r\ninto the road, my boy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Shepherdsons don't, father. They always take advantage.\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling\r\nhis tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped. The two young\r\nmen looked dark, but never said nothing. Miss Sophia she turned pale,\r\nbut the color come back when she found the man warn't hurt.\r\n\r\nSoon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by\r\nourselves, I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you want to kill him, Buck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I bet I did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHim? He never done nothing to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, what did you want to kill him for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, nothing--only it's on account of the feud.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat's a feud?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, where was you raised? Don't you know what a feud is?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever heard of it before--tell me about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d says Buck, \u201ca feud is this way: A man has a quarrel with\r\nanother man, and kills him; then that other man's brother kills _him_;\r\nthen the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the\r\n_cousins_ chip in--and by and by everybody's killed off, and there ain't\r\nno more feud. But it's kind of slow, and takes a long time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHas this one been going on long, Buck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I should _reckon_! It started thirty year ago, or som'ers along\r\nthere. There was trouble 'bout something, and then a lawsuit to settle\r\nit; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot the\r\nman that won the suit--which he would naturally do, of course. Anybody\r\nwould.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat was the trouble about, Buck?--land?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reckon maybe--I don't know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, who done the shooting? Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLaws, how do I know? It was so long ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon't anybody know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but they\r\ndon't know now what the row was about in the first place.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHas there been many killed, Buck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; right smart chance of funerals. But they don't always kill. Pa's\r\ngot a few buckshot in him; but he don't mind it 'cuz he don't weigh\r\nmuch, anyway. Bob's been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom's been\r\nhurt once or twice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHas anybody been killed this year, Buck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; we got one and they got one.  'Bout three months ago my cousin\r\nBud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t'other side\r\nof the river, and didn't have no weapon with him, which was blame'\r\nfoolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind\r\nhim, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin' after him with his gun in\r\nhis hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and 'stead of jumping\r\noff and taking to the brush, Bud 'lowed he could out-run him; so they\r\nhad it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all\r\nthe time; so at last Bud seen it warn't any use, so he stopped and faced\r\naround so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the old\r\nman he rode up and shot him down. But he didn't git much chance to\r\nenjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid _him_ out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reckon he _warn't_ a coward. Not by a blame' sight. There ain't a\r\ncoward amongst them Shepherdsons--not a one. And there ain't no cowards\r\namongst the Grangerfords either. Why, that old man kep' up his end in a\r\nfight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come\r\nout winner. They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got\r\nbehind a little woodpile, and kep' his horse before him to stop the\r\nbullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around\r\nthe old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them.\r\nHim and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the\r\nGrangerfords had to be _fetched_ home--and one of 'em was dead, and\r\nanother died the next day. No, sir; if a body's out hunting for cowards\r\nhe don't want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz\r\nthey don't breed any of that _kind_.\u201d\r\n\r\nNext Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody\r\na-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept\r\nthem between their knees or stood them handy against the wall. The\r\nShepherdsons done the same. It was pretty ornery preaching--all about\r\nbrotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was\r\na good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such\r\na powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and\r\npreforeordestination, and I don't know what all, that it did seem to me\r\nto be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their\r\nchairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull. Buck and\r\na dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep. I went up\r\nto our room, and judged I would take a nap myself. I found that sweet\r\nMiss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took\r\nme in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her,\r\nand I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and\r\nnot tell anybody, and I said I would. Then she said she'd forgot her\r\nTestament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books,\r\nand would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say\r\nnothing to nobody. I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the\r\nroad, and there warn't anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two,\r\nfor there warn't any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor\r\nin summer-time because it's cool. If you notice, most folks don't go to\r\nchurch only when they've got to; but a hog is different.\r\n\r\nSays I to myself, something's up; it ain't natural for a girl to be in\r\nsuch a sweat about a Testament. So I give it a shake, and out drops a\r\nlittle piece of paper with \u201cHALF-PAST TWO\u201d wrote on it with a pencil. I\r\nransacked it, but couldn't find anything else. I couldn't make anything\r\nout of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home\r\nand upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me. She\r\npulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till\r\nshe found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and\r\nbefore a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and\r\nsaid I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody. She was\r\nmighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it\r\nmade her powerful pretty. I was a good deal astonished, but when I got\r\nmy breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I\r\nhad read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing,\r\nand I told her \u201cno, only coarse-hand,\u201d and then she said the paper\r\nwarn't anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and\r\nplay now.\r\n\r\nI went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon\r\nI noticed that my nigger was following along behind. When we was out\r\nof sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes\r\na-running, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cMars Jawge, if you'll come down into de swamp I'll show you a whole\r\nstack o' water-moccasins.\u201d\r\n\r\nThinks I, that's mighty curious; he said that yesterday. He oughter\r\nknow a body don't love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for\r\nthem. What is he up to, anyway? So I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right; trot ahead.\u201d\r\n\r\nI followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded\r\nankle deep as much as another half-mile. We come to a little flat piece\r\nof land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines,\r\nand he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah's whah dey is.\r\nI's seed 'm befo'; I don't k'yer to see 'em no mo'.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid\r\nhim. I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch\r\nas big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man laying\r\nthere asleep--and, by jings, it was my old Jim!\r\n\r\nI waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to\r\nhim to see me again, but it warn't. He nearly cried he was so glad, but\r\nhe warn't surprised. Said he swum along behind me that night, and heard\r\nme yell every time, but dasn't answer, because he didn't want nobody to\r\npick _him_ up and take him into slavery again. Says he:\r\n\r\n\u201cI got hurt a little, en couldn't swim fas', so I wuz a considable ways\r\nbehine you towards de las'; when you landed I reck'ned I could ketch\r\nup wid you on de lan' 'dout havin' to shout at you, but when I see dat\r\nhouse I begin to go slow. I 'uz off too fur to hear what dey say to\r\nyou--I wuz 'fraid o' de dogs; but when it 'uz all quiet agin I knowed\r\nyou's in de house, so I struck out for de woods to wait for day. Early\r\nin de mawnin' some er de niggers come along, gwyne to de fields, en dey\r\ntuk me en showed me dis place, whah de dogs can't track me on accounts\r\no' de water, en dey brings me truck to eat every night, en tells me how\r\nyou's a-gitt'n along.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy didn't you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner, Jim?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, 'twarn't no use to 'sturb you, Huck, tell we could do sumfn--but\r\nwe's all right now. I ben a-buyin' pots en pans en vittles, as I got a\r\nchanst, en a-patchin' up de raf' nights when--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_What_ raft, Jim?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOur ole raf'.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean to say our old raft warn't smashed all to flinders?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, she warn't. She was tore up a good deal--one en' of her was; but\r\ndey warn't no great harm done, on'y our traps was mos' all los'. Ef we\r\nhadn' dive' so deep en swum so fur under water, en de night hadn' ben\r\nso dark, en we warn't so sk'yerd, en ben sich punkin-heads, as de sayin'\r\nis, we'd a seed de raf'. But it's jis' as well we didn't, 'kase now\r\nshe's all fixed up agin mos' as good as new, en we's got a new lot o'\r\nstuff, in de place o' what 'uz los'.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim--did you catch her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods? No; some er de niggers\r\nfoun' her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben', en dey hid her in a\r\ncrick 'mongst de willows, en dey wuz so much jawin' 'bout which un 'um\r\nshe b'long to de mos' dat I come to heah 'bout it pooty soon, so I ups\r\nen settles de trouble by tellin' 'um she don't b'long to none uv um, but\r\nto you en me; en I ast 'm if dey gwyne to grab a young white genlman's\r\npropaty, en git a hid'n for it? Den I gin 'm ten cents apiece, en dey\r\n'uz mighty well satisfied, en wisht some mo' raf's 'ud come along en\r\nmake 'm rich agin. Dey's mighty good to me, dese niggers is, en whatever\r\nI wants 'm to do fur me I doan' have to ast 'm twice, honey. Dat Jack's\r\na good nigger, en pooty smart.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he is. He ain't ever told me you was here; told me to come, and\r\nhe'd show me a lot of water-moccasins. If anything happens _he_ ain't\r\nmixed up in it. He can say he never seen us together, and it 'll be the\r\ntruth.\u201d\r\n\r\nI don't want to talk much about the next day. I reckon I'll cut it\r\npretty short. I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to turn over and\r\ngo to sleep again when I noticed how still it was--didn't seem to be\r\nanybody stirring. That warn't usual. Next I noticed that Buck was\r\nup and gone. Well, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes down stairs--nobody\r\naround; everything as still as a mouse. Just the same outside. Thinks\r\nI, what does it mean? Down by the wood-pile I comes across my Jack, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat's it all about?\u201d\r\n\r\nSays he:\r\n\r\n\u201cDon't you know, Mars Jawge?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d says I, \u201cI don't.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, den, Miss Sophia's run off! 'deed she has. She run off in de\r\nnight some time--nobody don't know jis' when; run off to get married\r\nto dat young Harney Shepherdson, you know--leastways, so dey 'spec. De\r\nfambly foun' it out 'bout half an hour ago--maybe a little mo'--en' I\r\n_tell_ you dey warn't no time los'. Sich another hurryin' up guns\r\nen hosses _you_ never see! De women folks has gone for to stir up de\r\nrelations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de\r\nriver road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him 'fo' he kin\r\ngit acrost de river wid Miss Sophia. I reck'n dey's gwyne to be mighty\r\nrough times.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBuck went off 'thout waking me up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I reck'n he _did_! Dey warn't gwyne to mix you up in it.\r\nMars Buck he loaded up his gun en 'lowed he's gwyne to fetch home a\r\nShepherdson or bust. Well, dey'll be plenty un 'm dah, I reck'n, en you\r\nbet you he'll fetch one ef he gits a chanst.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took up the river road as hard as I could put. By and by I begin to\r\nhear guns a good ways off. When I come in sight of the log store and\r\nthe woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees\r\nand brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the\r\nforks of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched. There was a\r\nwood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I\r\nwas going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn't.\r\n\r\nThere was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open\r\nplace before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at\r\na couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the\r\nsteamboat landing; but they couldn't come it. Every time one of them\r\nshowed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at. The\r\ntwo boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watch\r\nboth ways.\r\n\r\nBy and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling. They started\r\nriding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady\r\nbead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle. All\r\nthe men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started\r\nto carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the\r\nrun. They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed.\r\nThen the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after\r\nthem. They gained on the boys, but it didn't do no good, the boys had\r\ntoo good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree,\r\nand slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again.\r\nOne of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about\r\nnineteen years old.\r\n\r\nThe men ripped around awhile, and then rode away. As soon as they was\r\nout of sight I sung out to Buck and told him. He didn't know what\r\nto make of my voice coming out of the tree at first. He was awful\r\nsurprised. He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the\r\nmen come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or\r\nother--wouldn't be gone long. I wished I was out of that tree, but I\r\ndasn't come down. Buck begun to cry and rip, and 'lowed that him and\r\nhis cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this\r\nday yet. He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two\r\nor three of the enemy. Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in\r\nambush. Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their\r\nrelations--the Shepherdsons was too strong for them. I asked him what\r\nwas become of young Harney and Miss Sophia. He said they'd got across\r\nthe river and was safe. I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take\r\non because he didn't manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him--I\r\nhain't ever heard anything like it.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns--the men had\r\nslipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their\r\nhorses! The boys jumped for the river--both of them hurt--and as they\r\nswum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and\r\nsinging out, \u201cKill them, kill them!\u201d It made me so sick I most fell out\r\nof the tree. I ain't a-going to tell _all_ that happened--it would make\r\nme sick again if I was to do that. I wished I hadn't ever come ashore\r\nthat night to see such things. I ain't ever going to get shut of\r\nthem--lots of times I dream about them.\r\n\r\nI stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down.\r\nSometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little\r\ngangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the\r\ntrouble was still a-going on. I was mighty downhearted; so I made up my\r\nmind I wouldn't ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I\r\nwas to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss\r\nSophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and\r\nI judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way\r\nshe acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this awful mess\r\nwouldn't ever happened.\r\n\r\nWhen I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a\r\npiece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and\r\ntugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces,\r\nand got away as quick as I could. I cried a little when I was covering\r\nup Buck's face, for he was mighty good to me.\r\n\r\nIt was just dark now. I never went near the house, but struck through\r\nthe woods and made for the swamp. Jim warn't on his island, so I\r\ntramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows,\r\nred-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country. The raft was\r\ngone! My souls, but I was scared! I couldn't get my breath for most\r\na minute. Then I raised a yell. A voice not twenty-five foot from me\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\u201cGood lan'! is dat you, honey? Doan' make no noise.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was Jim's voice--nothing ever sounded so good before. I run along the\r\nbank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was\r\nso glad to see me. He says:\r\n\r\n\u201cLaws bless you, chile, I 'uz right down sho' you's dead agin. Jack's\r\nbeen heah; he say he reck'n you's ben shot, kase you didn' come home no\r\nmo'; so I's jes' dis minute a startin' de raf' down towards de mouf er\r\nde crick, so's to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack\r\ncomes agin en tells me for certain you _is_ dead. Lawsy, I's mighty\r\nglad to git you back again, honey.\u201d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right--that's mighty good; they won't find me, and they'll think\r\nI've been killed, and floated down the river--there's something up there\r\nthat 'll help them think so--so don't you lose no time, Jim, but just\r\nshove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.\u201d\r\n\r\nI never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in\r\nthe middle of the Mississippi. Then we hung up our signal lantern, and\r\njudged that we was free and safe once more. I hadn't had a bite to eat\r\nsince yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk,\r\nand pork and cabbage and greens--there ain't nothing in the world so good\r\nwhen it's cooked right--and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a\r\ngood time. I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was\r\nJim to get away from the swamp. We said there warn't no home like a\r\nraft, after all. Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a\r\nraft don't. You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by,\r\nthey slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely. Here is the way we put\r\nin the time. It was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a mile\r\nand a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as\r\nnight was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always\r\nin the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and\r\nwillows, and hid the raft with them. Then we set out the lines. Next\r\nwe slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool\r\noff; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee\r\ndeep, and watched the daylight come. Not a sound anywheres--perfectly\r\nstill--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs\r\na-cluttering, maybe. The first thing to see, looking away over the\r\nwater, was a kind of dull line--that was the woods on t'other side; you\r\ncouldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more\r\npaleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and\r\nwarn't black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots\r\ndrifting along ever so far away--trading scows, and such things; and\r\nlong black streaks--rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or\r\njumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and\r\nby you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the\r\nstreak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it\r\nand makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off\r\nof the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a\r\nlog-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t'other side of\r\nthe river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can\r\nthrow a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and\r\ncomes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell\r\non account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way,\r\nbecause they've left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they\r\ndo get pretty rank; and next you've got the full day, and everything\r\nsmiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!\r\n\r\nA little smoke couldn't be noticed now, so we would take some fish off\r\nof the lines and cook up a hot breakfast. And afterwards we would watch\r\nthe lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by\r\nlazy off to sleep. Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and\r\nmaybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the\r\nother side you couldn't tell nothing about her only whether she was\r\na stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn't be\r\nnothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid lonesomeness. Next\r\nyou'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it\r\nchopping, because they're most always doing it on a raft; you'd see the\r\naxe flash and come down--you don't hear nothing; you see that axe go\r\nup again, and by the time it's above the man's head then you hear the\r\n_k'chunk_!--it had took all that time to come over the water. So we\r\nwould put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness. Once\r\nthere was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating\r\ntin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them. A scow or a\r\nraft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and\r\nlaughing--heard them plain; but we couldn't see no sign of them; it made\r\nyou feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air.\r\nJim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; spirits wouldn't say, 'Dern the dern fog.'\u201d\r\n\r\nSoon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the\r\nmiddle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted\r\nher to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and\r\ntalked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night,\r\nwhenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes Buck's folks made\r\nfor me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn't go much on\r\nclothes, nohow.\r\n\r\nSometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest\r\ntime. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe\r\na spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water\r\nyou could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe\r\nyou could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts.\r\nIt's lovely to live on a raft. We had the sky up there, all speckled\r\nwith stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and\r\ndiscuss about whether they was made or only just happened. Jim he\r\nallowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would\r\nhave took too long to _make_ so many. Jim said the moon could a _laid_\r\nthem; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn't say nothing\r\nagainst it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it\r\ncould be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them\r\nstreak down. Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the\r\nnest.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the\r\ndark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out\r\nof her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful\r\npretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and\r\nher powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her\r\nwaves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the\r\nraft a bit, and after that you wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't\r\ntell how long, except maybe frogs or something.\r\n\r\nAfter midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or\r\nthree hours the shores was black--no more sparks in the cabin windows.\r\nThese sparks was our clock--the first one that showed again meant\r\nmorning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away.\r\n\r\nOne morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to\r\nthe main shore--it was only two hundred yards--and paddled about a mile\r\nup a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn't get some\r\nberries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed\r\nthe crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as\r\nthey could foot it. I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was\r\nafter anybody I judged it was _me_--or maybe Jim. I was about to dig out\r\nfrom there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung\r\nout and begged me to save their lives--said they hadn't been doing\r\nnothing, and was being chased for it--said there was men and dogs\r\na-coming. They wanted to jump right in, but I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDon't you do it. I don't hear the dogs and horses yet; you've got time\r\nto crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then you\r\ntake to the water and wade down to me and get in--that'll throw the dogs\r\noff the scent.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead,\r\nand in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off,\r\nshouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn't\r\nsee them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got\r\nfurther and further away all the time, we couldn't hardly hear them at\r\nall; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the\r\nriver, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the towhead and hid\r\nin the cottonwoods and was safe.\r\n\r\nOne of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head\r\nand very gray whiskers. He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and\r\na greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed\r\ninto his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses--no, he only had one. He had\r\nan old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over\r\nhis arm, and both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.\r\n\r\nThe other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery. After\r\nbreakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come out\r\nwas that these chaps didn't know one another.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat got you into trouble?\u201d says the baldhead to t'other chap.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth--and\r\nit does take it off, too, and generly the enamel along with it--but I\r\nstayed about one night longer than I ought to, and was just in the act\r\nof sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town, and\r\nyou told me they were coming, and begged me to help you to get off. So\r\nI told you I was expecting trouble myself, and would scatter out _with_\r\nyou. That's the whole yarn--what's yourn?\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I'd ben a-running' a little temperance revival thar 'bout a week,\r\nand was the pet of the women folks, big and little, for I was makin' it\r\nmighty warm for the rummies, I _tell_ you, and takin' as much as five\r\nor six dollars a night--ten cents a head, children and niggers free--and\r\nbusiness a-growin' all the time, when somehow or another a little report\r\ngot around last night that I had a way of puttin' in my time with a\r\nprivate jug on the sly. A nigger rousted me out this mornin', and told\r\nme the people was getherin' on the quiet with their dogs and horses, and\r\nthey'd be along pretty soon and give me 'bout half an hour's start,\r\nand then run me down if they could; and if they got me they'd tar\r\nand feather me and ride me on a rail, sure. I didn't wait for no\r\nbreakfast--I warn't hungry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOld man,\u201d said the young one, \u201cI reckon we might double-team it\r\ntogether; what do you think?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI ain't undisposed. What's your line--mainly?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJour printer by trade; do a little in patent medicines;\r\ntheater-actor--tragedy, you know; take a turn to mesmerism and phrenology\r\nwhen there's a chance; teach singing-geography school for a change;\r\nsling a lecture sometimes--oh, I do lots of things--most anything that\r\ncomes handy, so it ain't work. What's your lay?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI've done considerble in the doctoring way in my time. Layin' on o'\r\nhands is my best holt--for cancer and paralysis, and sich things; and I\r\nk'n tell a fortune pretty good when I've got somebody along to find out\r\nthe facts for me. Preachin's my line, too, and workin' camp-meetin's,\r\nand missionaryin' around.\u201d\r\n\r\nNobody never said anything for a while; then the young man hove a sigh\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\u201cAlas!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat 're you alassin' about?\u201d says the bald-head.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and be degraded\r\ndown into such company.\u201d And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye\r\nwith a rag.\r\n\r\n\u201cDern your skin, ain't the company good enough for you?\u201d says the\r\nbaldhead, pretty pert and uppish.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it _is_ good enough for me; it's as good as I deserve; for who\r\nfetched me so low when I was so high? I did myself. I don't blame\r\n_you_, gentlemen--far from it; I don't blame anybody. I deserve it\r\nall. Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I know--there's a grave\r\nsomewhere for me. The world may go on just as it's always done, and take\r\neverything from me--loved ones, property, everything; but it can't take\r\nthat. Some day I'll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken\r\nheart will be at rest.\u201d He went on a-wiping.\r\n\r\n\u201cDrot your pore broken heart,\u201d says the baldhead; \u201cwhat are you heaving\r\nyour pore broken heart at _us_ f'r? _we_ hain't done nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I know you haven't. I ain't blaming you, gentlemen. I brought\r\nmyself down--yes, I did it myself. It's right I should suffer--perfectly\r\nright--I don't make any moan.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBrought you down from whar? Whar was you brought down from?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, you would not believe me; the world never believes--let it pass--'tis\r\nno matter. The secret of my birth--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe secret of your birth! Do you mean to say--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d says the young man, very solemn, \u201cI will reveal it to you,\r\nfor I feel I may have confidence in you. By rights I am a duke!\u201d\r\n\r\nJim's eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too.\r\nThen the baldhead says:  \u201cNo! you can't mean it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled\r\nto this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the pure\r\nair of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own father\r\ndying about the same time. The second son of the late duke seized the\r\ntitles and estates--the infant real duke was ignored. I am the lineal\r\ndescendant of that infant--I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater; and\r\nhere am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despised\r\nby the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the\r\ncompanionship of felons on a raft!\u201d\r\n\r\nJim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but\r\nhe said it warn't much use, he couldn't be much comforted; said if we\r\nwas a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most\r\nanything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how. He said we\r\nought to bow when we spoke to him, and say \u201cYour Grace,\u201d or \u201cMy Lord,\u201d\r\n or \u201cYour Lordship\u201d--and he wouldn't mind it if we called him plain\r\n\u201cBridgewater,\u201d which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and\r\none of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for\r\nhim he wanted done.\r\n\r\nWell, that was all easy, so we done it. All through dinner Jim stood\r\naround and waited on him, and says, \u201cWill yo' Grace have some o' dis or\r\nsome o' dat?\u201d and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut the old man got pretty silent by and by--didn't have much to say, and\r\ndidn't look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on\r\naround that duke. He seemed to have something on his mind. So, along\r\nin the afternoon, he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cLooky here, Bilgewater,\u201d he says, \u201cI'm nation sorry for you, but you\r\nain't the only person that's had troubles like that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo you ain't. You ain't the only person that's ben snaked down\r\nwrongfully out'n a high place.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlas!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, you ain't the only person that's had a secret of his birth.\u201d And,\r\nby jings, _he_ begins to cry.\r\n\r\n\u201cHold! What do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBilgewater, kin I trust you?\u201d says the old man, still sort of sobbing.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the bitter death!\u201d He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it,\r\nand says, \u201cThat secret of your being: speak!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!\u201d\r\n\r\nYou bet you, Jim and me stared this time. Then the duke says:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, my friend, it is too true--your eyes is lookin' at this very moment\r\non the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the\r\nSixteen and Marry Antonette.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou! At your age! No! You mean you're the late Charlemagne; you must\r\nbe six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung\r\nthese gray hairs and this premature balditude. Yes, gentlemen, you\r\nsee before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin', exiled,\r\ntrampled-on, and sufferin' rightful King of France.\u201d\r\n\r\nWell, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn't know hardly what to\r\ndo, we was so sorry--and so glad and proud we'd got him with us, too.\r\nSo we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort\r\n_him_. But he said it warn't no use, nothing but to be dead and done\r\nwith it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel\r\neasier and better for a while if people treated him according to his\r\nrights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him\r\n\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d and waited on him first at meals, and didn't set down\r\nin his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me set to majestying him,\r\nand doing this and that and t'other for him, and standing up till he\r\ntold us we might set down. This done him heaps of good, and so he\r\ngot cheerful and comfortable. But the duke kind of soured on him, and\r\ndidn't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still,\r\nthe king acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke's\r\ngreat-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good\r\ndeal thought of by _his_ father, and was allowed to come to the palace\r\nconsiderable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by and by the\r\nking says:\r\n\r\n\u201cLike as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer\r\nraft, Bilgewater, and so what's the use o' your bein' sour? It 'll only\r\nmake things oncomfortable. It ain't my fault I warn't born a duke,\r\nit ain't your fault you warn't born a king--so what's the use to worry?\r\nMake the best o' things the way you find 'em, says I--that's my motto.\r\nThis ain't no bad thing that we've struck here--plenty grub and an easy\r\nlife--come, give us your hand, duke, and le's all be friends.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it. It took\r\naway all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because\r\nit would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the\r\nraft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody\r\nto be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.\r\n\r\nIt didn't take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn't no\r\nkings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds. But I\r\nnever said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it's the best way;\r\nthen you don't have no quarrels, and don't get into no trouble. If they\r\nwanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn't no objections, 'long as\r\nit would keep peace in the family; and it warn't no use to tell Jim, so\r\nI didn't tell him. If I never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt\r\nthat the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them\r\nhave their own way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we\r\ncovered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of\r\nrunning--was Jim a runaway nigger? Says I:\r\n\r\n\u201cGoodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run _south_?\u201d\r\n\r\nNo, they allowed he wouldn't. I had to account for things some way, so\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\u201cMy folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and\r\nthey all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike. Pa, he 'lowed\r\nhe'd break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who's got a little\r\none-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans. Pa was\r\npretty poor, and had some debts; so when he'd squared up there warn't\r\nnothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim. That warn't\r\nenough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way.\r\nWell, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched\r\nthis piece of a raft; so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans on it.\r\nPa's luck didn't hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of\r\nthe raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel;\r\nJim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four\r\nyears old, so they never come up no more. Well, for the next day or\r\ntwo we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in\r\nskiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was\r\na runaway nigger. We don't run daytimes no more now; nights they don't\r\nbother us.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe duke says:\r\n\r\n\u201cLeave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we\r\nwant to. I'll think the thing over--I'll invent a plan that'll fix it.\r\nWe'll let it alone for to-day, because of course we don't want to go by\r\nthat town yonder in daylight--it mightn't be healthy.\u201d\r\n\r\nTowards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat\r\nlightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was\r\nbeginning to shiver--it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see\r\nthat. So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see\r\nwhat the beds was like. My bed was a straw tick better than Jim's,\r\nwhich was a corn-shuck tick; there's always cobs around about in a shuck\r\ntick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry\r\nshucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it\r\nmakes such a rustling that you wake up. Well, the duke allowed he would\r\ntake my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn't. He says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that\r\na corn-shuck bed warn't just fitten for me to sleep on. Your Grace 'll\r\ntake the shuck bed yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nJim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was\r\ngoing to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when\r\nthe duke says:\r\n\r\n\u201c'Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of\r\noppression. Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I\r\nsubmit; 'tis my fate. I am alone in the world--let me suffer; can bear\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe got away as soon as it was good and dark. The king told us to stand\r\nwell out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we\r\ngot a long ways below the town. We come in sight of the little bunch of\r\nlights by and by--that was the town, you know--and slid by, about a half\r\na mile out, all right. When we was three-quarters of a mile below we\r\nhoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain\r\nand blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us\r\nto both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke\r\ncrawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night. It was my watch\r\nbelow till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned in anyway if I'd had a bed,\r\nbecause a body don't see such a storm as that every day in the week, not\r\nby a long sight. My souls, how the wind did scream along! And every\r\nsecond or two there'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half\r\na mile around, and you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain,\r\nand the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!--bum!\r\nbum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum--and the thunder would go rumbling\r\nand grumbling away, and quit--and then RIP comes another flash and\r\nanother sockdolager. The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes,\r\nbut I hadn't any clothes on, and didn't mind. We didn't have no trouble\r\nabout snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant\r\nthat we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or\r\nthat and miss them.\r\n\r\nI had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time,\r\nso Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always\r\nmighty good that way, Jim was. I crawled into the wigwam, but the king\r\nand the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn't no show for\r\nme; so I laid outside--I didn't mind the rain, because it was warm, and\r\nthe waves warn't running so high now. About two they come up again,\r\nthough, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because\r\nhe reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm; but he was\r\nmistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a\r\nregular ripper and washed me overboard. It most killed Jim a-laughing.\r\nHe was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.\r\n\r\nI took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by\r\nthe storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed\r\nI rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him\r\nand the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game. Then they got\r\ntired of it, and allowed they would \u201clay out a campaign,\u201d as they called\r\nit. The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of\r\nlittle printed bills and read them out loud. One bill said, \u201cThe\r\ncelebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,\u201d would \u201clecture on the\r\nScience of Phrenology\u201d at such and such a place, on the blank day of\r\nblank, at ten cents admission, and \u201cfurnish charts of character at\r\ntwenty-five cents apiece.\u201d The duke said that was _him_. In another\r\nbill he was the \u201cworld-renowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the\r\nYounger, of Drury Lane, London.\u201d In other bills he had a lot of other\r\nnames and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold with\r\na \u201cdivining-rod,\u201d \u201cdissipating witch spells,\u201d and so on. By and by he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the histrionic muse is the darling. Have you ever trod the boards,\r\nRoyalty?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d says the king.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shall, then, before you're three days older, Fallen Grandeur,\u201d says\r\nthe duke.  \u201cThe first good town we come to we'll hire a hall and do the\r\nsword fight in Richard III. and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet.\r\nHow does that strike you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but, you\r\nsee, I don't know nothing about play-actin', and hain't ever seen much\r\nof it. I was too small when pap used to have 'em at the palace. Do you\r\nreckon you can learn me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEasy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right. I'm jist a-freezn' for something fresh, anyway. Le's\r\ncommence right away.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and\r\nsaid he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut if Juliet's such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my white\r\nwhiskers is goin' to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, don't you worry; these country jakes won't ever think of that.\r\nBesides, you know, you'll be in costume, and that makes all the\r\ndifference in the world; Juliet's in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight\r\nbefore she goes to bed, and she's got on her night-gown and her ruffled\r\nnightcap. Here are the costumes for the parts.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was\r\nmeedyevil armor for Richard III. and t'other chap, and a long white\r\ncotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match. The king was\r\nsatisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the\r\nmost splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same\r\ntime, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the\r\nking and told him to get his part by heart.\r\n\r\nThere was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and\r\nafter dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run\r\nin daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would\r\ngo down to the town and fix that thing. The king allowed he would go,\r\ntoo, and see if he couldn't strike something. We was out of coffee, so\r\nJim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some.\r\n\r\nWhen we got there there warn't nobody stirring; streets empty, and\r\nperfectly dead and still, like Sunday. We found a sick nigger sunning\r\nhimself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn't too young or\r\ntoo sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in the\r\nwoods. The king got the directions, and allowed he'd go and work that\r\ncamp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.\r\n\r\nThe duke said what he was after was a printing-office. We found it;\r\na little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop--carpenters and\r\nprinters all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked. It was a dirty,\r\nlittered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures of\r\nhorses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls. The duke shed\r\nhis coat and said he was all right now. So me and the king lit out for\r\nthe camp-meeting.\r\n\r\nWe got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most\r\nawful hot day. There was as much as a thousand people there from\r\ntwenty mile around. The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched\r\neverywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep\r\noff the flies. There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with\r\nbranches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of\r\nwatermelons and green corn and such-like truck.\r\n\r\nThe preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was\r\nbigger and held crowds of people. The benches was made out of outside\r\nslabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into\r\nfor legs. They didn't have no backs. The preachers had high platforms\r\nto stand on at one end of the sheds. The women had on sun-bonnets;\r\nand some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the\r\nyoung ones had on calico. Some of the young men was barefooted, and\r\nsome of the children didn't have on any clothes but just a tow-linen\r\nshirt. Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks\r\nwas courting on the sly.\r\n\r\nThe first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn. He lined\r\nout two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it,\r\nthere was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then\r\nhe lined out two more for them to sing--and so on. The people woke up\r\nmore and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some\r\nbegun to groan, and some begun to shout. Then the preacher begun to\r\npreach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of\r\nthe platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front\r\nof it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his\r\nwords out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up\r\nhis Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and\r\nthat, shouting, \u201cIt's the brazen serpent in the wilderness! Look upon\r\nit and live!\u201d And people would shout out, \u201cGlory!--A-a-_men_!\u201d And so\r\nhe went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, come to the mourners' bench! come, black with sin! (_Amen_!) come,\r\nsick and sore! (_Amen_!) come, lame and halt and blind! (_Amen_!) come,\r\npore and needy, sunk in shame! (_A-A-Men_!) come, all that's worn and\r\nsoiled and suffering!--come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite\r\nheart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse\r\nis free, the door of heaven stands open--oh, enter in and be at rest!\u201d\r\n (_A-A-Men_! _Glory, Glory Hallelujah!_)\r\n\r\nAnd so on. You couldn't make out what the preacher said any more, on\r\naccount of the shouting and crying. Folks got up everywheres in the\r\ncrowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners'\r\nbench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the\r\nmourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and\r\nshouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.\r\n\r\nWell, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him\r\nover everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, and\r\nthe preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it. He\r\ntold them he was a pirate--been a pirate for thirty years out in the\r\nIndian Ocean--and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in\r\na fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to\r\ngoodness he'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat\r\nwithout a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that\r\never happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for\r\nthe first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to start\r\nright off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest\r\nof his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he could\r\ndo it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate crews\r\nin that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get there\r\nwithout money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinced\r\na pirate he would say to him, \u201cDon't you thank me, don't you give me no\r\ncredit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting,\r\nnatural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear preacher\r\nthere, the truest friend a pirate ever had!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd then he busted into tears, and so did everybody. Then somebody\r\nsings out, \u201cTake up a collection for him, take up a collection!\u201d Well,\r\na half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, \u201cLet _him_\r\npass the hat around!\u201d Then everybody said it, the preacher too.\r\n\r\nSo the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes,\r\nand blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being\r\nso good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the\r\nprettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would\r\nup and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he\r\nalways done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or\r\nsix times--and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to\r\nlive in their houses, and said they'd think it was an honor; but he said\r\nas this was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn't do no good, and\r\nbesides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to\r\nwork on the pirates.\r\n\r\nWhen we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had\r\ncollected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents. And then he had\r\nfetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a\r\nwagon when he was starting home through the woods. The king said,\r\ntake it all around, it laid over any day he'd ever put in in the\r\nmissionarying line. He said it warn't no use talking, heathens don't\r\namount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.\r\n\r\nThe duke was thinking _he'd_ been doing pretty well till the king come\r\nto show up, but after that he didn't think so so much. He had set\r\nup and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that\r\nprinting-office--horse bills--and took the money, four dollars. And he\r\nhad got in ten dollars' worth of advertisements for the paper, which he\r\nsaid he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance--so\r\nthey done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took\r\nin three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them\r\npaying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as\r\nusual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the\r\nprice as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash.\r\nHe set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of\r\nhis own head--three verses--kind of sweet and saddish--the name of it was,\r\n\u201cYes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart\u201d--and he left that all set\r\nup and ready to print in the paper, and didn't charge nothing for it.\r\nWell, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he'd done a pretty\r\nsquare day's work for it.\r\n\r\nThen he showed us another little job he'd printed and hadn't charged\r\nfor, because it was for us. It had a picture of a runaway nigger with\r\na bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and \u201c$200 reward\u201d under it. The\r\nreading was all about Jim, and just described him to a dot. It said\r\nhe run away from St. Jacques' plantation, forty mile below New Orleans,\r\nlast winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send\r\nhim back he could have the reward and expenses.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d says the duke, \u201cafter to-night we can run in the daytime if we\r\nwant to. Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot\r\nwith a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we\r\ncaptured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat,\r\nso we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down\r\nto get the reward. Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim,\r\nbut it wouldn't go well with the story of us being so poor. Too much\r\nlike jewelry. Ropes are the correct thing--we must preserve the unities,\r\nas we say on the boards.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn't be no trouble\r\nabout running daytimes. We judged we could make miles enough that night\r\nto get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke's work in\r\nthe printing office was going to make in that little town; then we could\r\nboom right along if we wanted to.\r\n\r\nWe laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten\r\no'clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn't\r\nhoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.\r\n\r\nWhen Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHuck, does you reck'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo' kings on dis\r\ntrip?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I says, \u201cI reckon not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d says he, \u201cdat's all right, den. I doan' mine one er two kings,\r\nbut dat's enough. Dis one's powerful drunk, en de duke ain' much\r\nbetter.\u201d\r\n\r\nI found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he could hear\r\nwhat it was like; but he said he had been in this country so long, and\r\nhad so much trouble, he'd forgot it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn't tie up. The\r\nking and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty; but after\r\nthey'd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good\r\ndeal. After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft,\r\nand pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches, and let his legs\r\ndangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe, and went\r\nto getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart. When he had got it pretty\r\ngood him and the duke begun to practice it together. The duke had to\r\nlearn him over and over again how to say every speech; and he made him\r\nsigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after a while he said he done\r\nit pretty well; \u201conly,\u201d he says, \u201cyou mustn't bellow out _Romeo_!\r\nthat way, like a bull--you must say it soft and sick and languishy,\r\nso--R-o-o-meo! that is the idea; for Juliet's a dear sweet mere child of\r\na girl, you know, and she doesn't bray like a jackass.\u201d\r\n\r\nWell, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out\r\nof oak laths, and begun to practice the sword fight--the duke called\r\nhimself Richard III.; and the way they laid on and pranced around\r\nthe raft was grand to see. But by and by the king tripped and fell\r\noverboard, and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about all\r\nkinds of adventures they'd had in other times along the river.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the duke says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Capet, we'll want to make this a first-class show, you know, so\r\nI guess we'll add a little more to it. We want a little something to\r\nanswer encores with, anyway.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat's onkores, Bilgewater?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe duke told him, and then says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI'll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor's hornpipe; and\r\nyou--well, let me see--oh, I've got it--you can do Hamlet's soliloquy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHamlet's which?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHamlet's soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare.\r\nAh, it's sublime, sublime! Always fetches the house. I haven't got\r\nit in the book--I've only got one volume--but I reckon I can piece it out\r\nfrom memory. I'll just walk up and down a minute, and see if I can call\r\nit back from recollection's vaults.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning horrible\r\nevery now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows; next he would\r\nsqueeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan; next\r\nhe would sigh, and next he'd let on to drop a tear. It was beautiful\r\nto see him. By and by he got it. He told us to give attention. Then\r\nhe strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his\r\narms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky;\r\nand then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that,\r\nall through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and swelled up his\r\nchest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before.\r\nThis is the speech--I learned it, easy enough, while he was learning it\r\nto the king:\r\n\r\nTo be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity of\r\nso long life; For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come\r\nto Dunsinane, But that the fear of something after death Murders the\r\ninnocent sleep, Great nature's second course, And makes us rather sling\r\nthe arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of.\r\nThere's the respect must give us pause: Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I\r\nwould thou couldst; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The\r\noppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The law's delay, and the\r\nquietus which his pangs might take. In the dead waste and middle of the\r\nnight, when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black, But\r\nthat the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns,\r\nBreathes forth contagion on the world, And thus the native hue of\r\nresolution, like the poor cat i' the adage, Is sicklied o'er with care.\r\nAnd all the clouds that lowered o'er our housetops, With this\r\nregard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action. 'Tis a\r\nconsummation devoutly to be wished. But soft you, the fair Ophelia: Ope\r\nnot thy ponderous and marble jaws. But get thee to a nunnery&mdash;go!\r\n\r\nWell, the old man he liked that speech, and he mighty soon got it so he\r\ncould do it first rate. It seemed like he was just born for it; and when\r\nhe had his hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely the way he\r\nwould rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off.\r\n\r\nThe first chance we got, the duke he had some show bills printed; and\r\nafter that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was a\r\nmost uncommon lively place, for there warn't nothing but sword-fighting\r\nand rehearsing--as the duke called it--going on all the time. One morning,\r\nwhen we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw, we come in sight\r\nof a little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up about\r\nthree-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a crick which was\r\nshut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us but Jim took\r\nthe canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that\r\nplace for our show.\r\n\r\nWe struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there that\r\nafternoon, and the country people was already beginning to come in, in\r\nall kinds of old shackly wagons, and on horses. The circus would leave\r\nbefore night, so our show would have a pretty good chance. The duke he\r\nhired the court house, and we went around and stuck up our bills.

The stores and houses was most all\r\nold shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn't ever been painted; they\r\nwas set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of\r\nreach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had little\r\ngardens around them, but they didn't seem to raise hardly anything in\r\nthem but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-up\r\nboots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out\r\ntin-ware. The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on\r\nat different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that\r\ndidn't generly have but one hinge--a leather one. Some of the fences\r\nhad been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in\r\nClumbus's time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden, and\r\npeople driving them out.\r\n\r\nAll the stores was along one street. They had white domestic awnings in\r\nfront, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts.\r\nThere was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting\r\non them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and\r\nchawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching--a mighty ornery\r\nlot. They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella,\r\nbut didn't wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill,\r\nand Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and\r\nused considerable many cuss words. There was as many as one loafer\r\nleaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands\r\nin his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw\r\nof tobacco or scratch. What a body was hearing amongst them all the\r\ntime was:\r\n\r\n\u201cGimme a chaw 'v tobacker, Hank.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCain't; I hain't got but one chaw left. Ask Bill.\u201d\r\n\r\nMaybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain't got\r\nnone. Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a\r\nchaw of tobacco of their own. They get all their chawing by borrowing;\r\nthey say to a fellow, \u201cI wisht you'd len' me a chaw, Jack, I jist this\r\nminute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had\u201d--which is a lie pretty\r\nmuch everytime; it don't fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain't no\r\nstranger, so he says:\r\n\r\n\u201c_You_ give him a chaw, did you? So did your sister's cat's\r\ngrandmother. You pay me back the chaws you've awready borry'd off'n me,\r\nLafe Buckner, then I'll loan you one or two ton of it, and won't charge\r\nyou no back intrust, nuther.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I _did_ pay you back some of it wunst.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, you did--'bout six chaws. You borry'd store tobacker and paid back\r\nnigger-head.\u201d\r\n\r\nStore tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the\r\nnatural leaf twisted. When they borrow a chaw they don't generly cut it\r\noff with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw with\r\ntheir teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in\r\ntwo; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it\r\nwhen it's handed back, and says, sarcastic:\r\n\r\n\u201cHere, gimme the _chaw_, and you take the _plug_.\u201d\r\n\r\nAll the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn't nothing else _but_\r\nmud--mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places,\r\nand two or three inches deep in _all_ the places. The hogs loafed and\r\ngrunted around everywheres. You'd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs\r\ncome lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way,\r\nwhere folks had to walk around her, and she'd stretch out and shut her\r\neyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as\r\nhappy as if she was on salary. And pretty soon you'd hear a loafer\r\nsing out, \u201cHi! _so_ boy! sick him, Tige!\u201d and away the sow would go,\r\nsquealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and\r\nthree or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the\r\nloafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun\r\nand look grateful for the noise. Then they'd settle back again till\r\nthere was a dog fight. There couldn't anything wake them up all over,\r\nand make them happy all over, like a dog fight--unless it might be\r\nputting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a\r\ntin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death.\r\n\r\nOn the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank,\r\nand they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in. The people\r\nhad moved out of them. The bank was caved away under one corner of some\r\nothers, and that corner was hanging over. People lived in them yet, but\r\nit was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house\r\ncaves in at a time. Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep\r\nwill start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the\r\nriver in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back,\r\nand back, and back, because the river's always gnawing at it.\r\n\r\nThe nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the\r\nwagons and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time.\r\nFamilies fetched their dinners with them from the country, and eat them\r\nin the wagons. There was considerable whisky drinking going on, and I\r\nseen three fights. By and by somebody sings out:\r\n\r\n\u201cHere comes old Boggs!--in from the country for his little old monthly\r\ndrunk; here he comes, boys!\u201d\r\n\r\nAll the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun out\r\nof Boggs. One of them says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWonder who he's a-gwyne to chaw up this time. If he'd a-chawed up all\r\nthe men he's ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he'd have\r\nconsiderable ruputation now.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother one says, \u201cI wisht old Boggs 'd threaten me, 'cuz then I'd know\r\nI warn't gwyne to die for a thousan' year.\u201d\r\n\r\nBoggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling like an\r\nInjun, and singing out:\r\n\r\n\u201cCler the track, thar. I'm on the waw-path, and the price uv coffins is\r\na-gwyne to raise.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year\r\nold, and had a very red face. Everybody yelled at him and laughed at\r\nhim and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he'd attend to them and\r\nlay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn't wait now because\r\nhe'd come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was, \u201cMeat\r\nfirst, and spoon vittles to top off on.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe see me, and rode up and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhar'd you come f'm, boy? You prepared to die?\u201d\r\n\r\nThen he rode on. I was scared, but a man says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHe don't mean nothing; he's always a-carryin' on like that when he's\r\ndrunk. He's the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw--never hurt nobody,\r\ndrunk nor sober.\u201d\r\n\r\nBoggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head down\r\nso he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells:\r\n\r\n\u201cCome out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you've swindled.\r\nYou're the houn' I'm after, and I'm a-gwyne to have you, too!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue\r\nto, and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and\r\ngoing on. By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five--and he was a\r\nheap the best dressed man in that town, too--steps out of the store, and\r\nthe crowd drops back on each side to let him come. He says to Boggs,\r\nmighty ca'm and slow--he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm tired of this, but I'll endure it till one o'clock. Till one\r\no'clock, mind--no longer. If you open your mouth against me only once\r\nafter that time you can't travel so far but I will find you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen he turns and goes in. The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody\r\nstirred, and there warn't no more laughing. Boggs rode off\r\nblackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street;\r\nand pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping\r\nit up. Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up,\r\nbut he wouldn't; they told him it would be one o'clock in about fifteen\r\nminutes, and so he _must_ go home--he must go right away. But it didn't\r\ndo no good. He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down\r\nin the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down\r\nthe street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could get\r\na chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they\r\ncould lock him up and get him sober; but it warn't no use--up the street\r\nhe would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing. By and by\r\nsomebody says:\r\n\r\n\u201cGo for his daughter!--quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he'll listen\r\nto her. If anybody can persuade him, she can.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo somebody started on a run. I walked down street a ways and stopped.\r\nIn about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on his\r\nhorse. He was a-reeling across the street towards me, bare-headed, with\r\na friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along.\r\nHe was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn't hanging back any, but was\r\ndoing some of the hurrying himself. Somebody sings out:\r\n\r\n\u201cBoggs!\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel\r\nSherburn. He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a\r\npistol raised in his right hand--not aiming it, but holding it out with\r\nthe barrel tilted up towards the sky. The same second I see a young\r\ngirl coming on the run, and two men with her. Boggs and the men turned\r\nround to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men\r\njumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to\r\na level--both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and says,\r\n\u201cO Lord, don't shoot!\u201d Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers back,\r\nclawing at the air--bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards\r\non to the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out. That young\r\ngirl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her\r\nfather, crying, and saying, \u201cOh, he's killed him, he's killed him!\u201d The\r\ncrowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with\r\ntheir necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying to\r\nshove them back and shouting, \u201cBack, back! give him air, give him air!\u201d\r\n\r\nColonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground, and turned\r\naround on his heels and walked off.\r\n\r\nThey took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just\r\nthe same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good\r\nplace at the window, where I was close to him and could see in. They\r\nlaid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and opened\r\nanother one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt\r\nfirst, and I seen where one of the bullets went in. He made about a\r\ndozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his\r\nbreath, and letting it down again when he breathed it out--and after that\r\nhe laid still; he was dead. Then they pulled his daughter away from\r\nhim, screaming and crying, and took her off. She was about sixteen, and\r\nvery sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared.\r\n\r\nWell, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and\r\npushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people\r\nthat had the places wouldn't give them up, and folks behind them was\r\nsaying all the time, \u201cSay, now, you've looked enough, you fellows;\r\n'tain't right and 'tain't fair for you to stay thar all the time, and\r\nnever give nobody a chance; other folks has their rights as well as\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe\r\nthere was going to be trouble. The streets was full, and everybody was\r\nexcited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened,\r\nand there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows,\r\nstretching their necks and listening. One long, lanky man, with long\r\nhair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a\r\ncrooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs\r\nstood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from\r\none place to t'other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their\r\nheads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their\r\nhands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with\r\nhis cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had\r\nstood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung\r\nout, \u201cBoggs!\u201d and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says\r\n\u201cBang!\u201d staggered backwards, says \u201cBang!\u201d again, and fell down flat on\r\nhis back. The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect;\r\nsaid it was just exactly the way it all happened. Then as much as a\r\ndozen people got out their bottles and treated him.\r\n\r\nWell, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched. In about a\r\nminute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and\r\nsnatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey swarmed up towards Sherburn's house, a-whooping and raging like\r\nInjuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped\r\nto mush, and it was awful to see. Children was heeling it ahead of the\r\nmob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along\r\nthe road was full of women's heads, and there was nigger boys in every\r\ntree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as the\r\nmob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of\r\nreach. Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared\r\nmost to death.\r\n\r\nThey swarmed up in front of Sherburn's palings as thick as they could\r\njam together, and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise. It\r\nwas a little twenty-foot yard. Some sung out \u201cTear down the fence! tear\r\ndown the fence!\u201d Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and\r\nsmashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to\r\nroll in like a wave.\r\n\r\nJust then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch,\r\nwith a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly\r\nca'm and deliberate, not saying a word. The racket stopped, and the\r\nwave sucked back.\r\n\r\nSherburn never said a word--just stood there, looking down. The\r\nstillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable. Sherburn run his eye slow\r\nalong the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to\r\nout-gaze him, but they couldn't; they dropped their eyes and looked\r\nsneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant\r\nkind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread\r\nthat's got sand in it.\r\n\r\nThen he says, slow and scornful:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe idea of _you_ lynching anybody! It's amusing. The idea of you\r\nthinking you had pluck enough to lynch a _man_! Because you're brave\r\nenough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along\r\nhere, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a\r\n_man_? Why, a _man's_ safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind--as\r\nlong as it's daytime and you're not behind him.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo I know you? I know you clear through. I was born and raised in the\r\nSouth, and I've lived in the North; so I know the average all around.\r\nThe average man's a coward. In the North he lets anybody walk over him\r\nthat wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it.\r\nIn the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men\r\nin the daytime, and robbed the lot. Your newspapers call you a\r\nbrave people so much that you think you are braver than any other\r\npeople--whereas you're just _as_ brave, and no braver. Why don't your\r\njuries hang murderers? Because they're afraid the man's friends will\r\nshoot them in the back, in the dark--and it's just what they _would_ do.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo they always acquit; and then a _man_ goes in the night, with a\r\nhundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal. Your mistake\r\nis, that you didn't bring a man with you; that's one mistake, and the\r\nother is that you didn't come in the dark and fetch your masks. You\r\nbrought _part_ of a man--Buck Harkness, there--and if you hadn't had him\r\nto start you, you'd a taken it out in blowing.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou didn't want to come. The average man don't like trouble and\r\ndanger. _You_ don't like trouble and danger. But if only _half_ a\r\nman--like Buck Harkness, there--shouts 'Lynch him! lynch him!' you're\r\nafraid to back down--afraid you'll be found out to be what you\r\nare--_cowards_--and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that\r\nhalf-a-man's coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big\r\nthings you're going to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that's\r\nwhat an army is--a mob; they don't fight with courage that's born in\r\nthem, but with courage that's borrowed from their mass, and from their\r\nofficers. But a mob without any _man_ at the head of it is _beneath_\r\npitifulness. Now the thing for _you_ to do is to droop your tails and\r\ngo home and crawl in a hole. If any real lynching's going to be done it\r\nwill be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they'll\r\nbring their masks, and fetch a _man_ along. Now _leave_--and take your\r\nhalf-a-man with you\u201d--tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking\r\nit when he says this.\r\n\r\nThe crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing\r\noff every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking\r\ntolerable cheap. I could a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn't want to.\r\n\r\nI went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman\r\nwent by, and then dived in under the tent. I had my twenty-dollar gold\r\npiece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because\r\nthere ain't no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from\r\nhome and amongst strangers that way. You can't be too careful. I ain't\r\nopposed to spending money on circuses when there ain't no other way, but\r\nthere ain't no use in _wasting_ it on them.\r\n\r\nIt was a real bully circus. It was the splendidest sight that ever was\r\nwhen they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side\r\nby side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes\r\nnor stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and\r\ncomfortable--there must a been twenty of them--and every lady with a\r\nlovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang\r\nof real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of\r\ndollars, and just littered with diamonds. It was a powerful fine sight;\r\nI never see anything so lovely. And then one by one they got up\r\nand stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and\r\ngraceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their\r\nheads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and\r\nevery lady's rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips,\r\nand she looking like the most loveliest parasol.\r\n\r\nAnd then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one\r\nfoot out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and\r\nmore, and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, cracking\r\nhis whip and shouting \u201cHi!--hi!\u201d and the clown cracking jokes behind\r\nhim; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her\r\nknuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how\r\nthe horses did lean over and hump themselves! And so one after the\r\nother they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I\r\never see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and\r\nwent just about wild.\r\n\r\nWell, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and\r\nall the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people. The\r\nringmaster couldn't ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick\r\nas a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever\r\n_could_ think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I\r\ncouldn't noway understand. Why, I couldn't a thought of them in a year.\r\nAnd by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring--said he wanted to\r\nride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was. They argued\r\nand tried to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen, and the whole show\r\ncome to a standstill. Then the people begun to holler at him and make\r\nfun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that\r\nstirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the\r\nbenches and swarm towards the ring, saying, \u201cKnock him down! throw him\r\nout!\u201d and one or two women begun to scream. So, then, the ringmaster\r\nhe made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn't be no\r\ndisturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more\r\ntrouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse.\r\nSo everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute\r\nhe was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around,\r\nwith two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the\r\ndrunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every\r\njump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing\r\ntill tears rolled down. And at last, sure enough, all the circus men\r\ncould do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation,\r\nround and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging\r\nto his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side,\r\nand then t'other one on t'other side, and the people just crazy. It\r\nwarn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger.\r\nBut pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle,\r\na-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and\r\ndropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire\r\ntoo. He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable\r\nas if he warn't ever drunk in his life--and then he begun to pull off his\r\nclothes and sling them. He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up\r\nthe air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he\r\nwas, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you\r\never saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly\r\nhum--and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to\r\nthe dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\nThen the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he _was_ the\r\nsickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon. Why, it was one of his own\r\nmen! He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on\r\nto nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn't\r\na been in that ringmaster's place, not for a thousand dollars. I don't\r\nknow; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but I\r\nnever struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough for _me_; and\r\nwherever I run across it, it can have all of _my_ custom every time.\r\n\r\nWell, that night we had _our_ show; but there warn't only about twelve\r\npeople there--just enough to pay expenses. And they laughed all the\r\ntime, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before\r\nthe show was over, but one boy which was asleep. So the duke said these\r\nArkansaw lunkheads couldn't come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted\r\nwas low comedy--and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he\r\nreckoned. He said he could size their style. So next morning he got\r\nsome big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off\r\nsome handbills, and stuck them up all over the village. The bills said:\r\n\r\n          AT THE COURT HOUSE!\r\n          FOR 3 NIGHTS ONLY!\r\n          The World-Renowned Tragedians\r\n          DAVID GARRICK THE YOUNGER!\r\n          AND\r\n          EDMUND KEAN THE ELDER!\r\n          Of the London and Continental\r\n          Theatres,\r\n          In their Thrilling Tragedy of\r\n          THE KING\u2019S CAMELOPARD\r\n          OR\r\n          THE ROYAL NONESUCH!!!\r\n          Admission 50 cents.\r\n\r\nThen at the bottom was the biggest line of all\u2014which said:\r\n\r\n          LADIES AND CHILDREN NOT ADMITTED.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d says he, \u201cif that line don\u2019t fetch them, I dont know Arkansaw!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and\r\na curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house\r\nwas jam full of men in no time. When the place couldn't hold no more,\r\nthe duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on\r\nto the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech,\r\nand praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one\r\nthat ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about\r\nEdmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it;\r\nand at last when he'd got everybody's expectations up high enough, he\r\nrolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come a-prancing\r\nout on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over,\r\nring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a\r\nrainbow. And--but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild,\r\nbut it was awful funny. The people most killed themselves laughing; and\r\nwhen the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they\r\nroared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done\r\nit over again, and after that they made him do it another time. Well, it\r\nwould make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.\r\n\r\nThen the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says\r\nthe great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts of\r\npressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold already for it\r\nin Drury Lane; and then he makes them another bow, and says if he has\r\nsucceeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be deeply\r\nobleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come\r\nand see it.\r\n\r\nTwenty people sings out:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat, is it over? Is that _all_?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe duke says yes. Then there was a fine time. Everybody sings\r\nout, \u201cSold!\u201d and rose up mad, and was a-going for that stage and them\r\ntragedians. But a big, fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts:\r\n\r\n\u201cHold on! Just a word, gentlemen.\u201d They stopped to listen.  \u201cWe are\r\nsold--mighty badly sold. But we don't want to be the laughing stock of\r\nthis whole town, I reckon, and never hear the last of this thing as long\r\nas we live. _No_. What we want is to go out of here quiet, and talk\r\nthis show up, and sell the _rest_ of the town! Then we'll all be in the\r\nsame boat. Ain't that sensible?\u201d (\u201cYou bet it is!--the jedge is right!\u201d\r\n everybody sings out.) \u201cAll right, then--not a word about any sell. Go\r\nalong home, and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy.\u201d\r\n\r\nNext day you couldn't hear nothing around that town but how splendid\r\nthat show was. House was jammed again that night, and we sold this\r\ncrowd the same way. When me and the king and the duke got home to the\r\nraft we all had a supper; and by and by, about midnight, they made Jim\r\nand me back her out and float her down the middle of the river, and\r\nfetch her in and hide her about two mile below town.\r\n\r\nThe third night the house was crammed again--and they warn't new-comers\r\nthis time, but people that was at the show the other two nights. I\r\nstood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went in had\r\nhis pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his coat--and I see it\r\nwarn't no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight. I smelt sickly eggs\r\nby the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such things; and if I know the\r\nsigns of a dead cat being around, and I bet I do, there was sixty-four\r\nof them went in. I shoved in there for a minute, but it was too various\r\nfor me; I couldn't stand it. Well, when the place couldn't hold no more\r\npeople the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door\r\nfor him a minute, and then he started around for the stage door, I after\r\nhim; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWalk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for the\r\nraft like the dickens was after you!\u201d\r\n\r\nI done it, and he done the same. We struck the raft at the same time,\r\nand in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream, all dark and\r\nstill, and edging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying a\r\nword. I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the\r\naudience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls out from under\r\nthe wigwam, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, how'd the old thing pan out this time, duke?\u201d He hadn't been\r\nup-town at all.\r\n\r\nWe never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village.\r\nThen we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly\r\nlaughed their bones loose over the way they'd served them people. The\r\nduke says:\r\n\r\n\u201cGreenhorns, flatheads! I knew the first house would keep mum and let\r\nthe rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they'd lay for us the\r\nthird night, and consider it was _their_ turn now. Well, it _is_ their\r\nturn, and I'd give something to know how much they'd take for it. I\r\n_would_ just like to know how they're putting in their opportunity.\r\nThey can turn it into a picnic if they want to--they brought plenty\r\nprovisions.\u201d\r\n\r\nThem rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that\r\nthree nights. I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that\r\nbefore. By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDon't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I says, \u201cit don't.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy don't it, Huck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it don't, because it's in the breed. I reckon they're all\r\nalike.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, Huck, dese kings o' ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat's jist what\r\ndey is; dey's reglar rapscallions.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that's what I'm a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as\r\nfur as I can make out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs dat so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou read about them once--you'll see. Look at Henry the Eight; this 'n\r\n's a Sunday-school Superintendent to _him_. And look at Charles Second,\r\nand Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward\r\nSecond, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon\r\nheptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain. My,\r\nyou ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom. He _was_ a\r\nblossom. He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head\r\nnext morning. And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was\r\nordering up eggs.  'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,' he says. They fetch her up.\r\nNext morning, 'Chop off her head!' And they chop it off.  'Fetch up\r\nJane Shore,' he says; and up she comes, Next morning, 'Chop off her\r\nhead'--and they chop it off.  'Ring up Fair Rosamun.' Fair Rosamun\r\nanswers the bell. Next morning, 'Chop off her head.' And he made every\r\none of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had\r\nhogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a\r\nbook, and called it Domesday Book--which was a good name and stated the\r\ncase. You don't know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip\r\nof ourn is one of the cleanest I've struck in history. Well, Henry he\r\ntakes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How\r\ndoes he go at it--give notice?--give the country a show? No. All of a\r\nsudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks\r\nout a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on. That was\r\n_his_ style--he never give anybody a chance. He had suspicions of his\r\nfather, the Duke of Wellington. Well, what did he do? Ask him to show\r\nup? No--drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat. S'pose people\r\nleft money laying around where he was--what did he do? He collared it.\r\nS'pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn't set\r\ndown there and see that he done it--what did he do? He always done the\r\nother thing. S'pose he opened his mouth--what then? If he didn't shut it\r\nup powerful quick he'd lose a lie every time. That's the kind of a bug\r\nHenry was; and if we'd a had him along 'stead of our kings he'd a fooled\r\nthat town a heap worse than ourn done. I don't say that ourn is lambs,\r\nbecause they ain't, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they\r\nain't nothing to _that_ old ram, anyway. All I say is, kings is kings,\r\nand you got to make allowances. Take them all around, they're a mighty\r\nornery lot. It's the way they're raised.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut dis one do _smell_ so like de nation, Huck.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, they all do, Jim. We can't help the way a king smells; history\r\ndon't tell no way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow de duke, he's a tolerble likely man in some ways.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, a duke's different. But not very different. This one's\r\na middling hard lot for a duke. When he's drunk there ain't no\r\nnear-sighted man could tell him from a king.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, anyways, I doan' hanker for no mo' un um, Huck. Dese is all I\r\nkin stan'.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's the way I feel, too, Jim. But we've got them on our hands, and we\r\ngot to remember what they are, and make allowances. Sometimes I wish we\r\ncould hear of a country that's out of kings.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat was the use to tell Jim these warn't real kings and dukes? It\r\nwouldn't a done no good; and, besides, it was just as I said: you\r\ncouldn't tell them from the real kind.\r\n\r\nI went to sleep, and Jim didn't call me when it was my turn. He often\r\ndone that. When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with\r\nhis head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself. I\r\ndidn't take notice nor let on. I knowed what it was about. He was\r\nthinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low\r\nand homesick; because he hadn't ever been away from home before in his\r\nlife; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white\r\nfolks does for their'n. It don't seem natural, but I reckon it's so.\r\nHe was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged I\r\nwas asleep, and saying, \u201cPo' little 'Lizabeth! po' little Johnny! it's\r\nmighty hard; I spec' I ain't ever gwyne to see you no mo', no mo'!\u201d He\r\nwas a mighty good nigger, Jim was.\r\n\r\nBut this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young\r\nones; and by and by he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat makes me feel so bad dis time 'uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder\r\non de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me er de time\r\nI treat my little 'Lizabeth so ornery. She warn't on'y 'bout fo' year\r\nole, en she tuck de sk'yarlet fever, en had a powful rough spell; but\r\nshe got well, en one day she was a-stannin' aroun', en I says to her, I\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\u201c'Shet de do'.'\r\n\r\n\u201cShe never done it; jis' stood dah, kiner smilin' up at me. It make me\r\nmad; en I says agin, mighty loud, I says:\r\n\r\n\u201c'Doan' you hear me? Shet de do'!'\r\n\r\n\u201cShe jis stood de same way, kiner smilin' up. I was a-bilin'! I says:\r\n\r\n\u201c'I lay I _make_ you mine!'\r\n\r\n\u201cEn wid dat I fetch' her a slap side de head dat sont her a-sprawlin'.\r\nDen I went into de yuther room, en 'uz gone 'bout ten minutes; en when\r\nI come back dah was dat do' a-stannin' open _yit_, en dat chile stannin'\r\nmos' right in it, a-lookin' down and mournin', en de tears runnin' down.\r\nMy, but I _wuz_ mad! I was a-gwyne for de chile, but jis' den--it was a\r\ndo' dat open innerds--jis' den, 'long come de wind en slam it to, behine\r\nde chile, ker-BLAM!--en my lan', de chile never move'! My breff mos'\r\nhop outer me; en I feel so--so--I doan' know HOW I feel. I crope out,\r\nall a-tremblin', en crope aroun' en open de do' easy en slow, en poke my\r\nhead in behine de chile, sof' en still, en all uv a sudden I says POW!\r\njis' as loud as I could yell. _She never budge!_ Oh, Huck, I bust out\r\na-cryin' en grab her up in my arms, en say, 'Oh, de po' little thing!\r\nDe Lord God Amighty fogive po' ole Jim, kaze he never gwyne to fogive\r\nhisself as long's he live!' Oh, she was plumb deef en dumb, Huck, plumb\r\ndeef en dumb--en I'd ben a-treat'n her so!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in\r\nthe middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the\r\nduke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns. Jim\r\nhe spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few\r\nhours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to\r\nlay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. You see, when we left him\r\nall alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all\r\nby himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway\r\nnigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay\r\nroped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around it.\r\n\r\nHe was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. He dressed\r\nJim up in King Lear's outfit--it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a\r\nwhite horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint\r\nand painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead,\r\ndull, solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine days. Blamed if\r\nhe warn't the horriblest looking outrage I ever see. Then the duke took\r\nand wrote out a sign on a shingle so:\r\n\r\nSick Arab--but harmless when not out of his head.\r\n\r\nAnd he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five\r\nfoot in front of the wigwam. Jim was satisfied. He said it was a sight\r\nbetter than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all\r\nover every time there was a sound. The duke told him to make himself\r\nfree and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop\r\nout of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like\r\na wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.\r\nWhich was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he\r\nwouldn't wait for him to howl. Why, he didn't only look like he was\r\ndead, he looked considerable more than that.\r\n\r\nThese rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was\r\nso much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be safe, because maybe\r\nthe news might a worked along down by this time. They couldn't hit no\r\nproject that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd\r\nlay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put up\r\nsomething on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop\r\nover to t'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence\r\nto lead him the profitable way--meaning the devil, I reckon. We had all\r\nbought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his'n\r\non, and he told me to put mine on. I done it, of course. The king's\r\nduds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy. I never\r\nknowed how clothes could change a body before. Why, before, he looked\r\nlike the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he'd take off\r\nhis new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand\r\nand good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark,\r\nand maybe was old Leviticus himself. Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I\r\ngot my paddle ready. There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away\r\nup under the point, about three mile above the town--been there a couple\r\nof hours, taking on freight. Says the king:\r\n\r\n\u201cSeein' how I'm dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St.\r\nLouis or Cincinnati, or some other big place. Go for the steamboat,\r\nHuckleberry; we'll come down to the village on her.\u201d\r\n\r\nI didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride.\r\nI fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went\r\nscooting along the bluff bank in the easy water. Pretty soon we come to\r\na nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the\r\nsweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a\r\ncouple of big carpet-bags by him.\r\n\r\n\u201cRun her nose in shore,\u201d says the king. I done it.  \u201cWher' you bound\r\nfor, young man?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor the steamboat; going to Orleans.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGit aboard,\u201d says the king.  \u201cHold on a minute, my servant 'll he'p you\r\nwith them bags. Jump out and he'p the gentleman, Adolphus\u201d--meaning me,\r\nI see.\r\n\r\nI done so, and then we all three started on again. The young chap was\r\nmighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather.\r\nHe asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he'd come\r\ndown the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he\r\nwas going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there. The\r\nyoung fellow says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I first see you I says to myself, 'It's Mr. Wilks, sure, and he\r\ncome mighty near getting here in time.' But then I says again, 'No, I\r\nreckon it ain't him, or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river.' You\r\n_ain't_ him, are you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, my name's Blodgett--Elexander Blodgett--_Reverend_ Elexander\r\nBlodgett, I s'pose I must say, as I'm one o' the Lord's poor servants.\r\nBut still I'm jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving\r\nin time, all the same, if he's missed anything by it--which I hope he\r\nhasn't.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he don't miss any property by it, because he'll get that all\r\nright; but he's missed seeing his brother Peter die--which he mayn't\r\nmind, nobody can tell as to that--but his brother would a give anything\r\nin this world to see _him_ before he died; never talked about nothing\r\nelse all these three weeks; hadn't seen him since they was boys\r\ntogether--and hadn't ever seen his brother William at all--that's the deef\r\nand dumb one--William ain't more than thirty or thirty-five. Peter and\r\nGeorge were the only ones that come out here; George was the married\r\nbrother; him and his wife both died last year. Harvey and William's the\r\nonly ones that's left now; and, as I was saying, they haven't got here\r\nin time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid anybody send 'em word?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter\r\nsaid then that he sorter felt like he warn't going to get well this\r\ntime. You see, he was pretty old, and George's g'yirls was too young to\r\nbe much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he\r\nwas kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn't seem\r\nto care much to live. He most desperately wanted to see Harvey--and\r\nWilliam, too, for that matter--because he was one of them kind that can't\r\nbear to make a will. He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he'd\r\ntold in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the\r\nproperty divided up so George's g'yirls would be all right--for George\r\ndidn't leave nothing. And that letter was all they could get him to put\r\na pen to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you reckon Harvey don't come? Wher' does he live?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, he lives in England--Sheffield--preaches there--hasn't ever been in\r\nthis country. He hasn't had any too much time--and besides he mightn't a\r\ngot the letter at all, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cToo bad, too bad he couldn't a lived to see his brothers, poor soul.\r\nYou going to Orleans, you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but that ain't only a part of it. I'm going in a ship, next\r\nWednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's a pretty long journey. But it'll be lovely; wisht I was a-going.\r\nIs Mary Jane the oldest? How old is the others?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMary Jane's nineteen, Susan's fifteen, and Joanna's about\r\nfourteen--that's the one that gives herself to good works and has a\r\nhare-lip.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, they could be worse off. Old Peter had friends, and they\r\nain't going to let them come to no harm. There's Hobson, the Babtis'\r\npreacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford,\r\nand Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the\r\nwidow Bartley, and--well, there's a lot of them; but these are the ones\r\nthat Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when\r\nhe wrote home; so Harvey 'll know where to look for friends when he gets\r\nhere.\u201d\r\n\r\nWell, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied\r\nthat young fellow. Blamed if he didn't inquire about everybody and\r\neverything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about\r\nPeter's business--which was a tanner; and about George's--which was a\r\ncarpenter; and about Harvey's--which was a dissentering minister; and so\r\non, and so on. Then he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause she's a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn't stop\r\nthere. When they're deep they won't stop for a hail. A Cincinnati boat\r\nwill, but this is a St. Louis one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas Peter Wilks well off?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, pretty well off. He had houses and land, and it's reckoned he\r\nleft three or four thousand in cash hid up som'ers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did you say he died?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn't say, but it was last night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFuneral to-morrow, likely?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, 'bout the middle of the day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it's all terrible sad; but we've all got to go, one time or\r\nanother. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we're all right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, it's the best way. Ma used to always say that.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she\r\ngot off. The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost\r\nmy ride, after all. When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up\r\nanother mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new\r\ncarpet-bags. And if he's gone over to t'other side, go over there and\r\ngit him. And tell him to git himself up regardless. Shove along, now.\u201d\r\n\r\nI see what _he_ was up to; but I never said nothing, of course. When\r\nI got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a\r\nlog, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had\r\nsaid it--every last word of it. And all the time he was a-doing it he\r\ntried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for\r\na slouch. I can't imitate him, and so I ain't a-going to try to; but he\r\nreally done it pretty good. Then he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHow are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef\r\nand dumb person on the histronic boards. So then they waited for a\r\nsteamboat.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along,\r\nbut they didn't come from high enough up the river; but at last there\r\nwas a big one, and they hailed her. She sent out her yawl, and we went\r\naboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted\r\nto go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and\r\nsaid they wouldn't land us. But the king was ca'm. He says:\r\n\r\n\u201cIf gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and\r\nput off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em, can't it?\u201d\r\n\r\nSo they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the\r\nvillage they yawled us ashore. About two dozen men flocked down when\r\nthey see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:\r\n\r\n\u201cKin any of you gentlemen tell me wher' Mr. Peter Wilks lives?\u201d they\r\ngive a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say,\r\n\u201cWhat d' I tell you?\u201d Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle:\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_\r\nlive yesterday evening.\u201d\r\n\r\nSudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up\r\nagainst the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his\r\nback, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cAlas, alas, our poor brother--gone, and we never got to see him; oh,\r\nit's too, too hard!\u201d\r\n\r\nThen he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to\r\nthe duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn't drop a carpet-bag and\r\nbust out a-crying. If they warn't the beatenest lot, them two frauds,\r\nthat ever I struck.\r\n\r\nWell, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all\r\nsorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill\r\nfor them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about\r\nhis brother's last moments, and the king he told it all over again on\r\nhis hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner\r\nlike they'd lost the twelve disciples. Well, if ever I struck anything\r\nlike it, I'm a nigger. It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the people\r\ntearing down on the run from every which way, some of them putting on\r\ntheir coats as they come. Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd,\r\nand the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march. The windows and\r\ndooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over a fence:\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it _them_?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou bet it is.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the\r\nthree girls was standing in the door. Mary Jane _was_ red-headed, but\r\nthat don't make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her\r\nface and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncles\r\nwas come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped for\r\nthem, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they had it!\r\nEverybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet again\r\nat last and have such good times.\r\n\r\nThen the king he hunched the duke private--I see him do it--and then he\r\nlooked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs; so\r\nthen him and the duke, with a hand across each other's shoulder, and\r\nt'other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there, everybody\r\ndropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noise stopping,\r\npeople saying \u201cSh!\u201d and all the men taking their hats off and drooping\r\ntheir heads, so you could a heard a pin fall. And when they got there\r\nthey bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one sight, and then\r\nthey bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans, most; and\r\nthen they put their arms around each other's necks, and hung their chins\r\nover each other's shoulders; and then for three minutes, or maybe four,\r\nI never see two men leak the way they done. And, mind you, everybody\r\nwas doing the same; and the place was that damp I never see anything\r\nlike it. Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, and t'other on\r\nt'other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the\r\ncoffin, and let on to pray all to themselves. Well, when it come\r\nto that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it, and\r\neverybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud--the poor girls,\r\ntoo; and every woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying a\r\nword, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand\r\non their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running\r\ndown, and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give\r\nthe next woman a show. I never see anything so disgusting.\r\n\r\nWell, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, and\r\nworks himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and\r\nflapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother\r\nto lose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long\r\njourney of four thousand mile, but it's a trial that's sweetened and\r\nsanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he\r\nthanks them out of his heart and out of his brother's heart, because out\r\nof their mouths they can't, words being too weak and cold, and all that\r\nkind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then he blubbers\r\nout a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to crying\r\nfit to bust.\r\n\r\nAnd the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the\r\ncrowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their\r\nmight, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church\r\nletting out. Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and\r\nhogwash I never see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and\r\nbully.\r\n\r\nThen the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his\r\nnieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the\r\nfamily would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up\r\nwith the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying\r\nyonder could speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that\r\nwas very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he will\r\nname the same, to wit, as follows, vizz.:--Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon\r\nLot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and\r\nDr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley.\r\n\r\nRev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting\r\ntogether--that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t'other\r\nworld, and the preacher was pinting him right. Lawyer Bell was away up\r\nto Louisville on business. But the rest was on hand, and so they all\r\ncome and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him;\r\nand then they shook hands with the duke and didn't say nothing, but just\r\nkept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst\r\nhe made all sorts of signs with his hands and said \u201cGoo-goo--goo-goo-goo\u201d\r\n all the time, like a baby that can't talk.\r\n\r\nSo the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty\r\nmuch everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts\r\nof little things that happened one time or another in the town, or to\r\nGeorge's family, or to Peter. And he always let on that Peter wrote him\r\nthe things; but that was a lie: he got every blessed one of them out of\r\nthat young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.\r\n\r\nThen Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the\r\nking he read it out loud and cried over it. It give the dwelling-house\r\nand three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard\r\n(which was doing a good business), along with some other houses and\r\nland (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand dollars in gold\r\nto Harvey and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hid down\r\ncellar. So these two frauds said they'd go and fetch it up, and have\r\neverything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle.\r\nWe shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag\r\nthey spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all them\r\nyaller-boys. My, the way the king's eyes did shine! He slaps the duke\r\non the shoulder and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, _this_ ain't bully nor noth'n! Oh, no, I reckon not! Why,\r\n_bully_, it beats the Nonesuch, _don't_ it?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe duke allowed it did. They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them\r\nthrough their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the\r\nking says:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt ain't no use talkin'; bein' brothers to a rich dead man and\r\nrepresentatives of furrin heirs that's got left is the line for you and\r\nme, Bilge. Thish yer comes of trust'n to Providence. It's the best\r\nway, in the long run. I've tried 'em all, and ther' ain't no better\r\nway.\u201d\r\n\r\nMost everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it on\r\ntrust; but no, they must count it. So they counts it, and it comes out\r\nfour hundred and fifteen dollars short. Says the king:\r\n\r\n\u201cDern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen\r\ndollars?\u201d\r\n\r\nThey worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it. Then\r\nthe duke says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake--I reckon\r\nthat's the way of it. The best way's to let it go, and keep still about\r\nit. We can spare it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, shucks, yes, we can _spare_ it. I don't k'yer noth'n 'bout\r\nthat--it's the _count_ I'm thinkin' about. We want to be awful square\r\nand open and above-board here, you know. We want to lug this h-yer\r\nmoney up stairs and count it before everybody--then ther' ain't noth'n\r\nsuspicious. But when the dead man says ther's six thous'n dollars, you\r\nknow, we don't want to--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHold on,\u201d says the duke.  \u201cLe's make up the deffisit,\u201d and he begun to\r\nhaul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's a most amaz'n' good idea, duke--you _have_ got a rattlin' clever\r\nhead on you,\u201d says the king.  \u201cBlest if the old Nonesuch ain't a heppin'\r\nus out agin,\u201d and _he_ begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them\r\nup.\r\n\r\nIt most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear.\r\n\r\n\u201cSay,\u201d says the duke, \u201cI got another idea. Le's go up stairs and count\r\nthis money, and then take and _give it to the girls_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood land, duke, lemme hug you! It's the most dazzling idea 'at ever a\r\nman struck. You have cert'nly got the most astonishin' head I ever see.\r\nOh, this is the boss dodge, ther' ain't no mistake 'bout it. Let 'em\r\nfetch along their suspicions now if they want to--this 'll lay 'em out.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the king\r\nhe counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile--twenty\r\nelegant little piles. Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked their\r\nchops. Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the king begin\r\nto swell himself up for another speech. He says:\r\n\r\n\u201cFriends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by\r\nthem that's left behind in the vale of sorrers. He has done generous by\r\nthese yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that's left\r\nfatherless and motherless. Yes, and we that knowed him knows that he\r\nwould a done _more_ generous by 'em if he hadn't ben afeard o' woundin'\r\nhis dear William and me. Now, _wouldn't_ he? Ther' ain't no question\r\n'bout it in _my_ mind. Well, then, what kind o' brothers would it be\r\nthat 'd stand in his way at sech a time? And what kind o' uncles would\r\nit be that 'd rob--yes, _rob_--sech poor sweet lambs as these 'at he loved\r\nso at sech a time? If I know William--and I _think_ I do--he--well, I'll\r\njest ask him.\u201d He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to\r\nthe duke with his hands, and the duke he looks at him stupid and\r\nleather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his\r\nmeaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his might for joy,\r\nand hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up. Then the king says,\r\n\u201cI knowed it; I reckon _that 'll_ convince anybody the way _he_ feels\r\nabout it. Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the money--take it\r\n_all_. It's the gift of him that lays yonder, cold but joyful.\u201d\r\n\r\nMary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for the\r\nduke, and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet. And\r\neverybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the\r\nhands off of them frauds, saying all the time:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou _dear_ good souls!--how _lovely_!--how _could_ you!\u201d\r\n\r\nWell, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased\r\nagain, and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; and\r\nbefore long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside,\r\nand stood a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody\r\nsaying anything to him either, because the king was talking and they was\r\nall busy listening. The king was saying--in the middle of something he'd\r\nstarted in on--\r\n\r\n\u201c--they bein' partickler friends o' the diseased. That's why they're\r\ninvited here this evenin'; but tomorrow we want _all_ to come--everybody;\r\nfor he respected everybody, he liked everybody, and so it's fitten that\r\nhis funeral orgies sh'd be public.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and\r\nevery little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke\r\nhe couldn't stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,\r\n\u201c_Obsequies_, you old fool,\u201d and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and\r\nreaching it over people's heads to him. The king he reads it and puts\r\nit in his pocket, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor William, afflicted as he is, his _heart's_ aluz right. Asks me\r\nto invite everybody to come to the funeral--wants me to make 'em all\r\nwelcome. But he needn't a worried--it was jest what I was at.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen he weaves along again, perfectly ca'm, and goes to dropping in his\r\nfuneral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before. And\r\nwhen he done it the third time he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI say orgies, not because it's the common term, because it\r\nain't--obsequies bein' the common term--but because orgies is the right\r\nterm. Obsequies ain't used in England no more now--it's gone out. We\r\nsay orgies now in England. Orgies is better, because it means the thing\r\nyou're after more exact. It's a word that's made up out'n the Greek\r\n_orgo_, outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew _jeesum_, to plant, cover\r\nup; hence in_ter._ So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public\r\nfuneral.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was the _worst_ I ever struck. Well, the iron-jawed man he laughed\r\nright in his face. Everybody was shocked. Everybody says, \u201cWhy,\r\n_doctor_!\u201d and Abner Shackleford says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Robinson, hain't you heard the news? This is Harvey Wilks.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it my poor brother's dear good friend and physician? I--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKeep your hands off of me!\u201d says the doctor.  \u201c_You_ talk like an\r\nEnglishman, _don't_ you? It's the worst imitation I ever heard. _You_\r\nPeter Wilks's brother! You're a fraud, that's what you are!\u201d\r\n\r\nWell, how they all took on! They crowded around the doctor and tried to\r\nquiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey 'd\r\nshowed in forty ways that he _was_ Harvey, and knowed everybody by name,\r\nand the names of the very dogs, and begged and _begged_ him not to hurt\r\nHarvey's feelings and the poor girl's feelings, and all that. But it\r\nwarn't no use; he stormed right along, and said any man that pretended\r\nto be an Englishman and couldn't imitate the lingo no better than what\r\nhe did was a fraud and a liar. The poor girls was hanging to the king\r\nand crying; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on _them_. He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\u201cI was your father's friend, and I'm your friend; and I warn you as a\r\nfriend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of\r\nharm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing\r\nto do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew,\r\nas he calls it. He is the thinnest kind of an impostor--has come here\r\nwith a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres, and\r\nyou take them for _proofs_, and are helped to fool yourselves by these\r\nfoolish friends here, who ought to know better. Mary Jane Wilks, you\r\nknow me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too. Now listen\r\nto me; turn this pitiful rascal out--I _beg_ you to do it. Will you?\u201d\r\n\r\nMary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome! She\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\u201c_Here_ is my answer.\u201d She hove up the bag of money and put it in the\r\nking's hands, and says, \u201cTake this six thousand dollars, and invest for\r\nme and my sisters any way you want to, and don't give us no receipt for\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and the\r\nhare-lip done the same on the other. Everybody clapped their hands and\r\nstomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his\r\nhead and smiled proud. The doctor says:\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right; I wash _my_ hands of the matter. But I warn you all that a\r\ntime 's coming when you're going to feel sick whenever you think of this\r\nday.\u201d And away he went.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, doctor,\u201d says the king, kinder mocking him; \u201cwe'll try and\r\nget 'em to send for you;\u201d which made them all laugh, and they said it\r\nwas a prime good hit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off\r\nfor spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for\r\nUncle William, and she'd give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which was\r\na little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters and\r\nsleep on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it.\r\nThe king said the cubby would do for his valley--meaning me.\r\n\r\nSo Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was\r\nplain but nice. She said she'd have her frocks and a lot of other traps\r\ntook out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey's way, but he said\r\nthey warn't. The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was\r\na curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor. There was an\r\nold hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and all sorts\r\nof little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room\r\nwith. The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for\r\nthese fixings, and so don't disturb them. The duke's room was pretty\r\nsmall, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.\r\n\r\nThat night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there,\r\nand I stood behind the king and the duke's chairs and waited on them,\r\nand the niggers waited on the rest. Mary Jane she set at the head of\r\nthe table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the biscuits\r\nwas, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried\r\nchickens was--and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to\r\nforce out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop,\r\nand said so--said \u201cHow _do_ you get biscuits to brown so nice?\u201d and\r\n\u201cWhere, for the land's sake, _did_ you get these amaz'n pickles?\u201d and\r\nall that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at a\r\nsupper, you know.\r\n\r\nAnd when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen\r\noff of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up\r\nthe things. The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blest\r\nif I didn't think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes. She says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you ever see the king?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho? William Fourth? Well, I bet I have--he goes to our church.\u201d I\r\nknowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on. So when I says he\r\ngoes to our church, she says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat--regular?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes--regular. His pew's right over opposite ourn--on t'other side the\r\npulpit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought he lived in London?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he does. Where _would_ he live?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I thought _you_ lived in Sheffield?\u201d\r\n\r\nI see I was up a stump. I had to let on to get choked with a chicken\r\nbone, so as to get time to think how to get down again. Then I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI mean he goes to our church regular when he's in Sheffield. That's\r\nonly in the summer time, when he comes there to take the sea baths.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, how you talk--Sheffield ain't on the sea.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, who said it was?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI _didn't_ nuther.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn't.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never said nothing of the kind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what _did_ you say, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSaid he come to take the sea _baths_--that's what I said.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, how's he going to take the sea baths if it ain't on the\r\nsea?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLooky here,\u201d I says; \u201cdid you ever see any Congress-water?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, did you have to go to Congress to get it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, no.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea\r\nbath.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow does he get it, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGets it the way people down here gets Congress-water--in barrels. There\r\nin the palace at Sheffield they've got furnaces, and he wants his water\r\nhot. They can't bile that amount of water away off there at the sea.\r\nThey haven't got no conveniences for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I see, now. You might a said that in the first place and saved\r\ntime.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was\r\ncomfortable and glad. Next, she says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you go to church, too?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes--regular.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere do you set?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, in our pew.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Whose_ pew?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, _ourn_--your Uncle Harvey's.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHis'n? What does _he_ want with a pew?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWants it to set in. What did you _reckon_ he wanted with it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I thought he'd be in the pulpit.\u201d\r\n\r\nRot him, I forgot he was a preacher. I see I was up a stump again, so I\r\nplayed another chicken bone and got another think. Then I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cBlame it, do you suppose there ain't but one preacher to a church?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what do they want with more?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!--to preach before a king? I never did see such a girl as you.\r\nThey don't have no less than seventeen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSeventeen! My land! Why, I wouldn't set out such a string as that,\r\nnot if I _never_ got to glory. It must take 'em a week.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShucks, they don't _all_ of 'em preach the same day--only _one_ of 'em.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, what does the rest of 'em do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, nothing much. Loll around, pass the plate--and one thing or\r\nanother. But mainly they don't do nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, what are they _for_?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, they're for _style_. Don't you know nothing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don't _want_ to know no such foolishness as that. How is\r\nservants treated in England? Do they treat 'em better 'n we treat our\r\nniggers?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_No_! A servant ain't nobody there. They treat them worse than dogs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon't they give 'em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year's\r\nweek, and Fourth of July?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, just listen! A body could tell _you_ hain't ever been to England\r\nby that. Why, Hare-l--why, Joanna, they never see a holiday from year's\r\nend to year's end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor nigger\r\nshows, nor nowheres.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor church?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor church.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut _you_ always went to church.\u201d\r\n\r\nWell, I was gone up again. I forgot I was the old man's servant. But\r\nnext minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was\r\ndifferent from a common servant and _had_ to go to church whether he\r\nwanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of its being the\r\nlaw. But I didn't do it pretty good, and when I got done I see she\r\nwarn't satisfied. She says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHonest injun, now, hain't you been telling me a lot of lies?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHonest injun,\u201d says I.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone of it at all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone of it at all. Not a lie in it,\u201d says I.\r\n\r\n\u201cLay your hand on this book and say it.\u201d\r\n\r\nI see it warn't nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it and\r\nsaid it. So then she looked a little better satisfied, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, I'll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if I'll\r\nbelieve the rest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it you won't believe, Joe?\u201d says Mary Jane, stepping in with\r\nSusan behind her.  \u201cIt ain't right nor kind for you to talk so to him,\r\nand him a stranger and so far from his people. How would you like to be\r\ntreated so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat's always your way, Maim--always sailing in to help somebody before\r\nthey're hurt. I hain't done nothing to him. He's told some stretchers,\r\nI reckon, and I said I wouldn't swallow it all; and that's every bit\r\nand grain I _did_ say. I reckon he can stand a little thing like that,\r\ncan't he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't care whether 'twas little or whether 'twas big; he's here in\r\nour house and a stranger, and it wasn't good of you to say it. If you\r\nwas in his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn't to\r\nsay a thing to another person that will make _them_ feel ashamed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Mam, he said--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt don't make no difference what he _said_--that ain't the thing. The\r\nthing is for you to treat him _kind_, and not be saying things to make\r\nhim remember he ain't in his own country and amongst his own folks.\u201d\r\n\r\nI says to myself, _this_ is a girl that I'm letting that old reptile rob\r\nher of her money!\r\n\r\nThen Susan _she_ waltzed in; and if you'll believe me, she did give\r\nHare-lip hark from the tomb!\r\n\r\nSays I to myself, and this is _another_ one that I'm letting him rob her\r\nof her money!\r\n\r\nThen Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely\r\nagain--which was her way; but when she got done there warn't hardly\r\nanything left o' poor Hare-lip. So she hollered.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, then,\u201d says the other girls; \u201cyou just ask his pardon.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe done it, too; and she done it beautiful. She done it so beautiful\r\nit was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so\r\nshe could do it again.\r\n\r\nI says to myself, this is _another_ one that I'm letting him rob her of\r\nher money. And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves\r\nout to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends. I felt so\r\nornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind's made up;\r\nI'll hive that money for them or bust.\r\n\r\nSo then I lit out--for bed, I said, meaning some time or another. When\r\nI got by myself I went to thinking the thing over. I says to myself,\r\nshall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds? No--that\r\nwon't do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would\r\nmake it warm for me. Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane? No--I\r\ndasn't do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they've got the\r\nmoney, and they'd slide right out and get away with it. If she was to\r\nfetch in help I'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with,\r\nI judge. No; there ain't no good way but one. I got to steal that\r\nmoney, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won't suspicion\r\nthat I done it. They've got a good thing here, and they ain't a-going\r\nto leave till they've played this family and this town for all they're\r\nworth, so I'll find a chance time enough. I'll steal it and hide it; and\r\nby and by, when I'm away down the river, I'll write a letter and tell\r\nMary Jane where it's hid. But I better hive it tonight if I can,\r\nbecause the doctor maybe hasn't let up as much as he lets on he has; he\r\nmight scare them out of here yet.\r\n\r\nSo, thinks I, I'll go and search them rooms. Upstairs the hall was\r\ndark, but I found the duke's room, and started to paw around it with\r\nmy hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let\r\nanybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to\r\nhis room and begun to paw around there. But I see I couldn't do nothing\r\nwithout a candle, and I dasn't light one, of course. So I judged I'd\r\ngot to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop. About that time\r\nI hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I\r\nreached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it would be; but I touched\r\nthe curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped in behind that and\r\nsnuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.\r\n\r\nThey come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to\r\nget down and look under the bed. Then I was glad I hadn't found the bed\r\nwhen I wanted it. And yet, you know, it's kind of natural to hide under\r\nthe bed when you are up to anything private. They sets down then, and\r\nthe king says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what is it? And cut it middlin' short, because it's better for\r\nus to be down there a-whoopin' up the mournin' than up here givin' 'em a\r\nchance to talk us over.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, this is it, Capet. I ain't easy; I ain't comfortable. That\r\ndoctor lays on my mind. I wanted to know your plans. I've got a\r\nnotion, and I think it's a sound one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, duke?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip\r\nit down the river with what we've got. Specially, seeing we got it so\r\neasy--_given_ back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of\r\ncourse we allowed to have to steal it back. I'm for knocking off and\r\nlighting out.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat made me feel pretty bad. About an hour or two ago it would a been\r\na little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The\r\nking rips out and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! And not sell out the rest o' the property? March off like\r\na passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous'n' dollars' worth o'\r\nproperty layin' around jest sufferin' to be scooped in?--and all good,\r\nsalable stuff, too.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn't\r\nwant to go no deeper--didn't want to rob a lot of orphans of _everything_\r\nthey had.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, how you talk!\u201d says the king.  \u201cWe sha'n't rob 'em of nothing at\r\nall but jest this money. The people that _buys_ the property is the\r\nsuff'rers; because as soon 's it's found out 'at we didn't own it--which\r\nwon't be long after we've slid--the sale won't be valid, and it 'll all\r\ngo back to the estate. These yer orphans 'll git their house back agin,\r\nand that's enough for _them_; they're young and spry, and k'n easy\r\nearn a livin'. _they_ ain't a-goin to suffer. Why, jest think--there's\r\nthous'n's and thous'n's that ain't nigh so well off. Bless you, _they_\r\nain't got noth'n' to complain of.\u201d\r\n\r\nWell, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all\r\nright, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that\r\ndoctor hanging over them. But the king says:\r\n\r\n\u201cCuss the doctor! What do we k'yer for _him_? Hain't we got all the\r\nfools in town on our side? And ain't that a big enough majority in any\r\ntown?\u201d\r\n\r\nSo they got ready to go down stairs again. The duke says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't think we put that money in a good place.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat cheered me up. I'd begun to think I warn't going to get a hint of\r\nno kind to help me. The king says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause Mary Jane 'll be in mourning from this out; and first you know\r\nthe nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds\r\nup and put 'em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and\r\nnot borrow some of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour head's level agin, duke,\u201d says the king; and he comes a-fumbling\r\nunder the curtain two or three foot from where I was. I stuck tight to\r\nthe wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what them\r\nfellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what\r\nI'd better do if they did catch me. But the king he got the bag before\r\nI could think more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicioned\r\nI was around. They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw\r\ntick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot or two\r\namongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger only\r\nmakes up the feather-bed, and don't turn over the straw tick only about\r\ntwice a year, and so it warn't in no danger of getting stole now.\r\n\r\nBut I knowed better. I had it out of there before they was half-way\r\ndown stairs. I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I\r\ncould get a chance to do better. I judged I better hide it outside\r\nof the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the\r\nhouse a good ransacking: I knowed that very well. Then I turned in,\r\nwith my clothes all on; but I couldn't a gone to sleep if I'd a wanted\r\nto, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business. By and by I\r\nheard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my pallet and laid\r\nwith my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if anything was\r\ngoing to happen. But nothing did.\r\n\r\nSo I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn't\r\nbegun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring. So I tiptoed\r\nalong, and got down stairs all right. There warn't a sound anywheres.\r\nI peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that\r\nwas watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs. The door\r\nwas open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a\r\ncandle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but\r\nI see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I\r\nshoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't there.\r\nJust then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me. I\r\nrun in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place I\r\nsee to hide the bag was in the coffin. The lid was shoved along about\r\na foot, showing the dead man's face down in there, with a wet cloth over\r\nit, and his shroud on. I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just\r\ndown beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was\r\nso cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door.\r\n\r\nThe person coming was Mary Jane. She went to the coffin, very soft, and\r\nkneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see\r\nshe begun to cry, though I couldn't hear her, and her back was to me. I\r\nslid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I'd make sure them\r\nwatchers hadn't seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everything\r\nwas all right. They hadn't stirred.\r\n\r\nI slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing\r\nplaying out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much\r\nresk about it. Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because\r\nwhen we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to\r\nMary Jane, and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain't the\r\nthing that's going to happen; the thing that's going to happen is, the\r\nmoney 'll be found when they come to screw on the lid. Then the king\r\n'll get it again, and it 'll be a long day before he gives anybody\r\nanother chance to smouch it from him. Of course I _wanted_ to slide\r\ndown and get it out of there, but I dasn't try it. Every minute it was\r\ngetting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin\r\nto stir, and I might get catched--catched with six thousand dollars in my\r\nhands that nobody hadn't hired me to take care of. I don't wish to be\r\nmixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself.\r\n\r\nWhen I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the\r\nwatchers was gone. There warn't nobody around but the family and the\r\nwidow Bartley and our tribe. I watched their faces to see if anything\r\nhad been happening, but I couldn't tell.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and they\r\nset the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then\r\nset all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till\r\nthe hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full. I see the coffin\r\nlid was the way it was before, but I dasn't go to look in under it, with\r\nfolks around.\r\n\r\nThen the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took\r\nseats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour\r\nthe people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the\r\ndead man's face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was\r\nall very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding\r\nhandkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a\r\nlittle. There warn't no other sound but the scraping of the feet on\r\nthe floor and blowing noses--because people always blows them more at a\r\nfuneral than they do at other places except church.\r\n\r\nWhen the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his\r\nblack gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last\r\ntouches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable,\r\nand making no more sound than a cat. He never spoke; he moved people\r\naround, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done\r\nit with nods, and signs with his hands. Then he took his place over\r\nagainst the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever\r\nsee; and there warn't no more smile to him than there is to a ham.\r\n\r\nThey had borrowed a melodeum--a sick one; and when everything was ready\r\na young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and\r\ncolicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one\r\nthat had a good thing, according to my notion. Then the Reverend Hobson\r\nopened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most\r\noutrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only\r\none dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right\r\nalong; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait--you\r\ncouldn't hear yourself think. It was right down awkward, and nobody\r\ndidn't seem to know what to do. But pretty soon they see that\r\nlong-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say,\r\n\u201cDon't you worry--just depend on me.\u201d Then he stooped down and begun\r\nto glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people's\r\nheads. So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and\r\nmore outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two\r\nsides of the room, he disappears down cellar. Then in about two seconds\r\nwe heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or\r\ntwo, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn\r\ntalk where he left off. In a minute or two here comes this undertaker's\r\nback and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and\r\nglided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his\r\nmouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher,\r\nover the people's heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, \u201c_He\r\nhad a rat_!\u201d Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to\r\nhis place. You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people,\r\nbecause naturally they wanted to know. A little thing like that don't\r\ncost nothing, and it's just the little things that makes a man to be\r\nlooked up to and liked. There warn't no more popular man in town than\r\nwhat that undertaker was.\r\n\r\nWell, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and\r\nthen the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and\r\nat last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the\r\ncoffin with his screw-driver. I was in a sweat then, and watched him\r\npretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as\r\nsoft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast. So there I was! I\r\ndidn't know whether the money was in there or not. So, says I, s'pose\r\nsomebody has hogged that bag on the sly?--now how do I know whether\r\nto write to Mary Jane or not? S'pose she dug him up and didn't find\r\nnothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might get\r\nhunted up and jailed; I'd better lay low and keep dark, and not write at\r\nall; the thing's awful mixed now; trying to better it, I've worsened it\r\na hundred times, and I wish to goodness I'd just let it alone, dad fetch\r\nthe whole business!\r\n\r\nThey buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces\r\nagain--I couldn't help it, and I couldn't rest easy. But nothing come of\r\nit; the faces didn't tell me nothing.\r\n\r\nThe king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up,\r\nand made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his\r\ncongregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must\r\nhurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home. He was\r\nvery sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could\r\nstay longer, but they said they could see it couldn't be done. And he\r\nsaid of course him and William would take the girls home with them; and\r\nthat pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed\r\nand amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too--tickled\r\nthem so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told\r\nhim to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready. Them\r\npoor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them\r\ngetting fooled and lied to so, but I didn't see no safe way for me to\r\nchip in and change the general tune.\r\n\r\nWell, blamed if the king didn't bill the house and the niggers and all\r\nthe property for auction straight off--sale two days after the funeral;\r\nbut anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to.\r\n\r\nSo the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls' joy\r\ngot the first jolt. A couple of nigger traders come along, and the king\r\nsold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called\r\nit, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their\r\nmother down the river to Orleans. I thought them poor girls and them\r\nniggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each\r\nother, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it. The girls\r\nsaid they hadn't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold\r\naway from the town. I can't ever get it out of my memory, the sight of\r\nthem poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other's necks\r\nand crying; and I reckon I couldn't a stood it all, but would a had\r\nto bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn't knowed the sale warn't no\r\naccount and the niggers would be back home in a week or two.\r\n\r\nThe thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out\r\nflatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the\r\nchildren that way. It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he\r\nbulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tell\r\nyou the duke was powerful uneasy.\r\n\r\nNext day was auction day. About broad day in the morning the king and\r\nthe duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look\r\nthat there was trouble. The king says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWas you in my room night before last?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, your majesty\u201d--which was the way I always called him when nobody but\r\nour gang warn't around.\r\n\r\n\u201cWas you in there yisterday er last night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, your majesty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHonor bright, now--no lies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHonor bright, your majesty, I'm telling you the truth. I hain't been\r\na-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed\r\nit to you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe duke says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you seen anybody else go in there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStop and think.\u201d\r\n\r\nI studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I see the niggers go in there several times.\u201d\r\n\r\nBoth of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn't ever\r\nexpected it, and then like they _had_. Then the duke says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat, all of them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo--leastways, not all at once--that is, I don't think I ever see them\r\nall come _out_ at once but just one time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHello! When was that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was the day we had the funeral. In the morning. It warn't early,\r\nbecause I overslept. I was just starting down the ladder, and I see\r\nthem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, go on, _go_ on! What did they do? How'd they act?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey didn't do nothing. And they didn't act anyway much, as fur as I\r\nsee. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they'd shoved in\r\nthere to do up your majesty's room, or something, s'posing you was up;\r\nand found you _warn't_ up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the\r\nway of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn't already waked you\r\nup.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGreat guns, _this_ is a go!\u201d says the king; and both of them looked\r\npretty sick and tolerable silly. They stood there a-thinking and\r\nscratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a\r\nlittle raspy chuckle, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand. They let on\r\nto be _sorry_ they was going out of this region! And I believed they\r\n_was_ sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody. Don't ever tell _me_\r\nany more that a nigger ain't got any histrionic talent. Why, the way\r\nthey played that thing it would fool _anybody_. In my opinion, there's\r\na fortune in 'em. If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn't want a\r\nbetter lay-out than that--and here we've gone and sold 'em for a song.\r\nYes, and ain't privileged to sing the song yet. Say, where _is_ that\r\nsong--that draft?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the bank for to be collected. Where _would_ it be?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, _that's_ all right then, thank goodness.\u201d\r\n\r\nSays I, kind of timid-like:\r\n\r\n\u201cIs something gone wrong?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe king whirls on me and rips out:\r\n\r\n\u201cNone o' your business! You keep your head shet, and mind y'r own\r\naffairs--if you got any. Long as you're in this town don't you forgit\r\n_that_--you hear?\u201d Then he says to the duke, \u201cWe got to jest swaller it\r\nand say noth'n': mum's the word for _us_.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick sales _and_ small profits! It's a good business--yes.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe king snarls around on him and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI was trying to do for the best in sellin' 'em out so quick. If the\r\nprofits has turned out to be none, lackin' considable, and none to\r\ncarry, is it my fault any more'n it's yourn?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, _they'd_ be in this house yet and we _wouldn't_ if I could a got\r\nmy advice listened to.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped\r\naround and lit into _me_ again. He give me down the banks for not\r\ncoming and _telling_ him I see the niggers come out of his room acting\r\nthat way--said any fool would a _knowed_ something was up. And then\r\nwaltzed in and cussed _himself_ awhile, and said it all come of him not\r\nlaying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he'd be\r\nblamed if he'd ever do it again. So they went off a-jawing; and I felt\r\ndreadful glad I'd worked it all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn't\r\ndone the niggers no harm by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy and by it was getting-up time. So I come down the ladder and started\r\nfor down-stairs; but as I come to the girls' room the door was open, and\r\nI see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she'd\r\nbeen packing things in it--getting ready to go to England. But she\r\nhad stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her\r\nhands, crying. I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would. I\r\nwent in there and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Mary Jane, you can't a-bear to see people in trouble, and I\r\ncan't--most always. Tell me about it.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo she done it. And it was the niggers--I just expected it. She said\r\nthe beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her; she didn't\r\nknow _how_ she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother and\r\nthe children warn't ever going to see each other no more--and then busted\r\nout bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, dear, dear, to think they ain't _ever_ going to see each other any\r\nmore!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut they _will_--and inside of two weeks--and I _know_ it!\u201d says I.\r\n\r\nLaws, it was out before I could think! And before I could budge she\r\nthrows her arms around my neck and told me to say it _again_, say it\r\n_again_, say it _again_!\r\n\r\nI see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close\r\nplace. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very\r\nimpatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and\r\neased-up, like a person that's had a tooth pulled out. So I went to\r\nstudying it out. I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells\r\nthe truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks,\r\nthough I ain't had no experience, and can't say for certain; but it\r\nlooks so to me, anyway; and yet here's a case where I'm blest if it\r\ndon't look to me like the truth is better and actuly _safer_ than a lie.\r\nI must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it's\r\nso kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it. Well, I\r\nsays to myself at last, I'm a-going to chance it; I'll up and tell the\r\ntruth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of\r\npowder and touching it off just to see where you'll go to. Then I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you\r\ncould go and stay three or four days?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; Mr. Lothrop's. Why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind why yet. If I'll tell you how I know the niggers will see\r\neach other again inside of two weeks--here in this house--and _prove_ how\r\nI know it--will you go to Mr. Lothrop's and stay four days?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFour days!\u201d she says; \u201cI'll stay a year!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I says, \u201cI don't want nothing more out of _you_ than just\r\nyour word--I druther have it than another man's kiss-the-Bible.\u201d She\r\nsmiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, \u201cIf you don't mind it,\r\nI'll shut the door--and bolt it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen I come back and set down again, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDon't you holler. Just set still and take it like a man. I got to\r\ntell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it's a\r\nbad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain't no help for\r\nit. These uncles of yourn ain't no uncles at all; they're a couple of\r\nfrauds--regular dead-beats. There, now we're over the worst of it, you\r\ncan stand the rest middling easy.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal\r\nwater now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher\r\nall the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck\r\nthat young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she\r\nflung herself on to the king's breast at the front door and he kissed\r\nher sixteen or seventeen times--and then up she jumps, with her face\r\nafire like sunset, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe brute! Come, don't waste a minute--not a _second_--we'll have them\r\ntarred and feathered, and flung in the river!\u201d\r\n\r\nSays I:\r\n\r\n\u201cCert'nly. But do you mean _before_ you go to Mr. Lothrop's, or--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d she says, \u201cwhat am I _thinking_ about!\u201d she says, and set right\r\ndown again.  \u201cDon't mind what I said--please don't--you _won't,_ now,\r\n_will_ you?\u201d Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that\r\nI said I would die first.  \u201cI never thought, I was so stirred up,\u201d she\r\nsays; \u201cnow go on, and I won't do so any more. You tell me what to do,\r\nand whatever you say I'll do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I says, \u201cit's a rough gang, them two frauds, and I'm fixed so\r\nI got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not--I\r\ndruther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town would\r\nget me out of their claws, and I'd be all right; but there'd be another\r\nperson that you don't know about who'd be in big trouble. Well, we\r\ngot to save _him_, hain't we? Of course. Well, then, we won't blow on\r\nthem.\u201d\r\n\r\nSaying them words put a good idea in my head. I see how maybe I could\r\nget me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave.\r\nBut I didn't want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard\r\nto answer questions but me; so I didn't want the plan to begin working\r\ntill pretty late to-night. I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Mary Jane, I'll tell you what we'll do, and you won't have to stay\r\nat Mr. Lothrop's so long, nuther. How fur is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA little short of four miles--right out in the country, back here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that 'll answer. Now you go along out there, and lay low\r\ntill nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you home\r\nagain--tell them you've thought of something. If you get here before\r\neleven put a candle in this window, and if I don't turn up wait _till_\r\neleven, and _then_ if I don't turn up it means I'm gone, and out of the\r\nway, and safe. Then you come out and spread the news around, and get\r\nthese beats jailed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d she says, \u201cI'll do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd if it just happens so that I don't get away, but get took up along\r\nwith them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand,\r\nand you must stand by me all you can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStand by you! indeed I will. They sha'n't touch a hair of your head!\u201d\r\n she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said\r\nit, too.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I get away I sha'n't be here,\u201d I says, \u201cto prove these rapscallions\r\nain't your uncles, and I couldn't do it if I _was_ here. I could swear\r\nthey was beats and bummers, that's all, though that's worth something.\r\nWell, there's others can do that better than what I can, and they're\r\npeople that ain't going to be doubted as quick as I'd be. I'll tell you\r\nhow to find them. Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper. There--'Royal\r\nNonesuch, Bricksville.' Put it away, and don't lose it. When the\r\ncourt wants to find out something about these two, let them send up to\r\nBricksville and say they've got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch,\r\nand ask for some witnesses--why, you'll have that entire town down here\r\nbefore you can hardly wink, Miss Mary. And they'll come a-biling, too.\u201d\r\n\r\nI judged we had got everything fixed about right now. So I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cJust let the auction go right along, and don't worry. Nobody don't\r\nhave to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction\r\non accounts of the short notice, and they ain't going out of this till\r\nthey get that money; and the way we've fixed it the sale ain't going to\r\ncount, and they ain't going to get no money. It's just like the way\r\nit was with the niggers--it warn't no sale, and the niggers will be\r\nback before long. Why, they can't collect the money for the _niggers_\r\nyet--they're in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d she says, \u201cI'll run down to breakfast now, and then I'll start\r\nstraight for Mr. Lothrop's.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c'Deed, _that_ ain't the ticket, Miss Mary Jane,\u201d I says, \u201cby no manner\r\nof means; go _before_ breakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I never thought--and come to think, I don't know. What was it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it's because you ain't one of these leather-face people. I don't\r\nwant no better book than what your face is. A body can set down and\r\nread it off like coarse print. Do you reckon you can go and face your\r\nuncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, there, don't! Yes, I'll go before breakfast--I'll be glad to.\r\nAnd leave my sisters with them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; never mind about them. They've got to stand it yet a while. They\r\nmight suspicion something if all of you was to go. I don't want you to\r\nsee them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was\r\nto ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something.\r\nNo, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I'll fix it with all of\r\nthem. I'll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say\r\nyou've went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, or\r\nto see a friend, and you'll be back to-night or early in the morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGone to see a friend is all right, but I won't have my love given to\r\nthem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, it sha'n't be.\u201d It was well enough to tell _her_ so--no\r\nharm in it. It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it's\r\nthe little things that smooths people's roads the most, down here below;\r\nit would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn't cost nothing. Then\r\nI says:  \u201cThere's one more thing--that bag of money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, they've got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think\r\n_how_ they got it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, you're out, there. They hain't got it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, who's got it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish I knowed, but I don't. I _had_ it, because I stole it from\r\nthem; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I'm\r\nafraid it ain't there no more. I'm awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I'm\r\njust as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest. I\r\ncome nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I\r\ncome to, and run--and it warn't a good place.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, stop blaming yourself--it's too bad to do it, and I won't allow\r\nit--you couldn't help it; it wasn't your fault. Where did you hide it?\u201d\r\n\r\nI didn't want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I\r\ncouldn't seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that\r\ncorpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach. So\r\nfor a minute I didn't say nothing; then I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI'd ruther not _tell_ you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don't\r\nmind letting me off; but I'll write it for you on a piece of paper, and\r\nyou can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop's, if you want to. Do you\r\nreckon that 'll do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo I wrote:  \u201cI put it in the coffin. It was in there when you was\r\ncrying there, away in the night. I was behind the door, and I was\r\nmighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by\r\nherself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own\r\nroof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it\r\nto her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the\r\nhand, hard, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201c_Good_-bye. I'm going to do everything just as you've told me; and if\r\nI don't ever see you again, I sha'n't ever forget you and I'll think of\r\nyou a many and a many a time, and I'll _pray_ for you, too!\u201d--and she was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nPray for me! I reckoned if she knowed me she'd take a job that was more\r\nnearer her size. But I bet she done it, just the same--she was just that\r\nkind. She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion--there\r\nwarn't no back-down to her, I judge. You may say what you want to, but\r\nin my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in\r\nmy opinion she was just full of sand. It sounds like flattery, but it\r\nain't no flattery. And when it comes to beauty--and goodness, too--she\r\nlays over them all. I hain't ever seen her since that time that I see\r\nher go out of that door; no, I hain't ever seen her since, but I reckon\r\nI've thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying\r\nshe would pray for me; and if ever I'd a thought it would do any good\r\nfor me to pray for _her_, blamed if I wouldn't a done it or bust.\r\n\r\nWell, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see\r\nher go. When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat's the name of them people over on t'other side of the river that\r\nyou all goes to see sometimes?\u201d\r\n\r\nThey says:\r\n\r\n\u201cThere's several; but it's the Proctors, mainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat's the name,\u201d I says; \u201cI most forgot it. Well, Miss Mary Jane she\r\ntold me to tell you she's gone over there in a dreadful hurry--one of\r\nthem's sick.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich one?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it's--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSakes alive, I hope it ain't _Hanner_?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm sorry to say it,\u201d I says, \u201cbut Hanner's the very one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy goodness, and she so well only last week! Is she took bad?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt ain't no name for it. They set up with her all night, Miss Mary\r\nJane said, and they don't think she'll last many hours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly think of that, now! What's the matter with her?\u201d\r\n\r\nI couldn't think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cMumps.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMumps your granny! They don't set up with people that's got the\r\nmumps.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey don't, don't they? You better bet they do with _these_ mumps.\r\nThese mumps is different. It's a new kind, Miss Mary Jane said.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow's it a new kind?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause it's mixed up with other things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat other things?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, and\r\nyaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don't know what all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy land! And they call it the _mumps_?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat's what Miss Mary Jane said.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what in the nation do they call it the _mumps_ for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, because it _is_ the mumps. That's what it starts with.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, ther' ain't no sense in it. A body might stump his toe, and take\r\npison, and fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his brains\r\nout, and somebody come along and ask what killed him, and some numskull\r\nup and say, 'Why, he stumped his _toe_.' Would ther' be any sense\r\nin that? _No_. And ther' ain't no sense in _this_, nuther. Is it\r\nketching?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it _ketching_? Why, how you talk. Is a _harrow_ catching--in the\r\ndark? If you don't hitch on to one tooth, you're bound to on another,\r\nain't you? And you can't get away with that tooth without fetching the\r\nwhole harrow along, can you? Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of a\r\nharrow, as you may say--and it ain't no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you\r\ncome to get it hitched on good.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it's awful, I think,\u201d says the hare-lip.  \u201cI'll go to Uncle\r\nHarvey and--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d I says, \u201cI _would_. Of _course_ I would. I wouldn't lose no\r\ntime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, why wouldn't you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust look at it a minute, and maybe you can see. Hain't your uncles\r\nobleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can? And do you\r\nreckon they'd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that\r\njourney by yourselves? _you_ know they'll wait for you. So fur, so\r\ngood. Your uncle Harvey's a preacher, ain't he? Very well, then; is a\r\n_preacher_ going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive\r\na _ship clerk?_--so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard? Now\r\n_you_ know he ain't. What _will_ he do, then? Why, he'll say, 'It's a\r\ngreat pity, but my church matters has got to get along the best way they\r\ncan; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps,\r\nand so it's my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months\r\nit takes to show on her if she's got it.' But never mind, if you think\r\nit's best to tell your uncle Harvey--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good\r\ntimes in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane's\r\ngot it or not? Why, you talk like a muggins.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, anyway, maybe you'd better tell some of the neighbors.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cListen at that, now. You do beat all for natural stupidness. Can't\r\nyou _see_ that _they'd_ go and tell? Ther' ain't no way but just to not\r\ntell anybody at _all_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, maybe you're right--yes, I judge you _are_ right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she's gone out a while,\r\nanyway, so he won't be uneasy about her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that. She says, 'Tell them to\r\ngive Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I've run over\r\nthe river to see Mr.'--Mr.--what _is_ the name of that rich family your\r\nuncle Peter used to think so much of?--I mean the one that--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you must mean the Apthorps, ain't it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course; bother them kind of names, a body can't ever seem to\r\nremember them, half the time, somehow. Yes, she said, say she has run\r\nover for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy\r\nthis house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had\r\nit than anybody else; and she's going to stick to them till they say\r\nthey'll come, and then, if she ain't too tired, she's coming home; and\r\nif she is, she'll be home in the morning anyway. She said, don't say\r\nnothing about the Proctors, but only about the Apthorps--which 'll be\r\nperfectly true, because she is going there to speak about their buying\r\nthe house; I know it, because she told me so herself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and\r\ngive them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.\r\n\r\nEverything was all right now. The girls wouldn't say nothing because\r\nthey wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would ruther\r\nMary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of\r\nDoctor Robinson. I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty neat--I\r\nreckoned Tom Sawyer couldn't a done it no neater himself. Of course he\r\nwould a throwed more style into it, but I can't do that very handy, not\r\nbeing brung up to it.\r\n\r\nWell, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end\r\nof the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man\r\nhe was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside of the\r\nauctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and then, or a little\r\ngoody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing\r\nfor sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himself generly.\r\n\r\nBut by and by the thing dragged through, and everything was\r\nsold--everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard. So\r\nthey'd got to work that off--I never see such a girafft as the king was\r\nfor wanting to swallow _everything_. Well, whilst they was at it a\r\nsteamboat landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping\r\nand yelling and laughing and carrying on, and singing out:\r\n\r\n\u201c_Here's_ your opposition line! here's your two sets o' heirs to old\r\nPeter Wilks--and you pays your money and you takes your choice!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a\r\nnice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling. And, my souls,\r\nhow the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up. But I didn't see no\r\njoke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some\r\nto see any. I reckoned they'd turn pale. But no, nary a pale did\r\n_they_ turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up, but\r\njust went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that's\r\ngoogling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazed\r\ndown sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in\r\nhis very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the\r\nworld. Oh, he done it admirable. Lots of the principal people\r\ngethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side. That old\r\ngentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death. Pretty\r\nsoon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced _like_ an\r\nEnglishman--not the king's way, though the king's _was_ pretty good for\r\nan imitation. I can't give the old gent's words, nor I can't imitate\r\nhim; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a surprise to me which I wasn't looking for; and I'll\r\nacknowledge, candid and frank, I ain't very well fixed to meet it and\r\nanswer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he's broke his\r\narm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the\r\nnight by a mistake. I am Peter Wilks' brother Harvey, and this is his\r\nbrother William, which can't hear nor speak--and can't even make signs to\r\namount to much, now't he's only got one hand to work them with. We are\r\nwho we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can\r\nprove it. But up till then I won't say nothing more, but go to the hotel\r\nand wait.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and\r\nblethers out:\r\n\r\n\u201cBroke his arm--_very_ likely, _ain't_ it?--and very convenient, too,\r\nfor a fraud that's got to make signs, and ain't learnt how. Lost\r\ntheir baggage! That's _mighty_ good!--and mighty ingenious--under the\r\n_circumstances_!\u201d\r\n\r\nSo he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four,\r\nor maybe half a dozen. One of these was that doctor; another one was\r\na sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind\r\nmade out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and\r\nwas talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and\r\nthen and nodding their heads--it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone\r\nup to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along\r\nand listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the\r\nking now. And when the king got done this husky up and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when'd you come to this\r\ntown?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe day before the funeral, friend,\u201d says the king.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what time o' day?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the evenin'--'bout an hour er two before sundown.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_How'd_ you come?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, how'd you come to be up at the Pint in the _mornin_'--in a\r\ncanoe?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI warn't up at the Pint in the mornin'.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's a lie.\u201d\r\n\r\nSeveral of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an\r\nold man and a preacher.\r\n\r\n\u201cPreacher be hanged, he's a fraud and a liar. He was up at the Pint\r\nthat mornin'. I live up there, don't I? Well, I was up there, and\r\nhe was up there. I see him there. He come in a canoe, along with Tim\r\nCollins and a boy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor he up and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reckon I would, but I don't know. Why, yonder he is, now. I know\r\nhim perfectly easy.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was me he pointed at. The doctor says:\r\n\r\n\u201cNeighbors, I don't know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if\r\n_these_ two ain't frauds, I am an idiot, that's all. I think it's our\r\nduty to see that they don't get away from here till we've looked into\r\nthis thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you. We'll take\r\nthese fellows to the tavern and affront them with t'other couple, and I\r\nreckon we'll find out _something_ before we get through.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king's friends; so\r\nwe all started. It was about sundown. The doctor he led me along by\r\nthe hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand.\r\n\r\nWe all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and\r\nfetched in the new couple. First, the doctor says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they're\r\nfrauds, and they may have complices that we don't know nothing about.\r\nIf they have, won't the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter\r\nWilks left? It ain't unlikely. If these men ain't frauds, they won't\r\nobject to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove\r\nthey're all right--ain't that so?\u201d\r\n\r\nEverybody agreed to that. So I judged they had our gang in a pretty\r\ntight place right at the outstart. But the king he only looked\r\nsorrowful, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cGentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain't got no disposition\r\nto throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation\r\no' this misable business; but, alas, the money ain't there; you k'n send\r\nand see, if you want to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is it, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it\r\ninside o' the straw tick o' my bed, not wishin' to bank it for the few\r\ndays we'd be here, and considerin' the bed a safe place, we not bein'\r\nused to niggers, and suppos'n' 'em honest, like servants in England.\r\nThe niggers stole it the very next mornin' after I had went down\r\nstairs; and when I sold 'em I hadn't missed the money yit, so they got\r\nclean away with it. My servant here k'n tell you 'bout it, gentlemen.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor and several said \u201cShucks!\u201d and I see nobody didn't altogether\r\nbelieve him. One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it. I said\r\nno, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I\r\nnever thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up\r\nmy master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them.\r\nThat was all they asked me. Then the doctor whirls on me and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cAre _you_ English, too?\u201d\r\n\r\nI says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, \u201cStuff!\u201d\r\n\r\nWell, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had\r\nit, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about\r\nsupper, nor ever seemed to think about it--and so they kept it up, and\r\nkept it up; and it _was_ the worst mixed-up thing you ever see. They\r\nmade the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his'n;\r\nand anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a _seen_ that the\r\nold gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies. And by and by\r\nthey had me up to tell what I knowed. The king he give me a left-handed\r\nlook out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the\r\nright side. I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there,\r\nand all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't get pretty\r\nfur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:\r\n\r\n\u201cSet down, my boy; I wouldn't strain myself if I was you. I reckon\r\nyou ain't used to lying, it don't seem to come handy; what you want is\r\npractice. You do it pretty awkward.\u201d\r\n\r\nI didn't care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off,\r\nanyway.\r\n\r\nThe doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell--\u201d The king broke in and\r\nreached out his hand, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often\r\nabout?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked\r\npleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side\r\nand talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cThat 'll fix it. I'll take the order and send it, along with your\r\nbrother's, and then they'll know it's all right.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted\r\nhis head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something;\r\nand then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time the\r\nduke looked sick. But he took the pen and wrote. So then the lawyer\r\nturns to the new old gentleman and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn't read it. The lawyer looked\r\npowerful astonished, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it beats _me_\u201d--and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket,\r\nand examined them, and then examined the old man's writing, and then\r\n_them_ again; and then says:  \u201cThese old letters is from Harvey Wilks;\r\nand here's _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn't\r\nwrite them\u201d (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell\r\nyou, to see how the lawyer had took them in), \u201cand here's _this_ old\r\ngentleman's hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, _he_ didn't\r\nwrite them--fact is, the scratches he makes ain't properly _writing_ at\r\nall. Now, here's some letters from--\u201d\r\n\r\nThe new old gentleman says:\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you please, let me explain. Nobody can read my hand but my brother\r\nthere--so he copies for me. It's _his_ hand you've got there, not mine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Well_!\u201d says the lawyer, \u201cthis _is_ a state of things. I've got some\r\nof William's letters, too; so if you'll get him to write a line or so we\r\ncan com--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe _can't_ write with his left hand,\u201d says the old gentleman.  \u201cIf he\r\ncould use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters\r\nand mine too. Look at both, please--they're by the same hand.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe lawyer done it, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe it's so--and if it ain't so, there's a heap stronger\r\nresemblance than I'd noticed before, anyway. Well, well, well! I\r\nthought we was right on the track of a solution, but it's gone to grass,\r\npartly. But anyway, one thing is proved--_these_ two ain't either of 'em\r\nWilkses\u201d--and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.\r\n\r\nWell, what do you think? That muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in\r\n_then_! Indeed he wouldn't. Said it warn't no fair test. Said his\r\nbrother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn't tried\r\nto write--_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute\r\nhe put the pen to paper. And so he warmed up and went warbling and\r\nwarbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was\r\nsaying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI've thought of something. Is there anybody here that helped to lay\r\nout my br--helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d says somebody, \u201cme and Ab Turner done it. We're both here.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen the old man turns towards the king, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?\u201d\r\n\r\nBlamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he'd a\r\nsqushed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took\r\nhim so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make\r\nmost _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any\r\nnotice, because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man?\r\nHe whitened a little; he couldn't help it; and it was mighty still in\r\nthere, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him. Says\r\nI to myself, _now_ he'll throw up the sponge--there ain't no more use.\r\nWell, did he? A body can't hardly believe it, but he didn't. I reckon\r\nhe thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so\r\nthey'd thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away.\r\nAnyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cMf! It's a _very_ tough question, _ain't_ it! _yes_, sir, I k'n\r\ntell you what's tattooed on his breast. It's jest a small, thin, blue\r\narrow--that's what it is; and if you don't look clost, you can't see it.\r\n_now_ what do you say--hey?\u201d\r\n\r\nWell, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\nThe new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and\r\nhis eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king _this_ time, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\u201cThere--you've heard what he said! Was there any such mark on Peter\r\nWilks' breast?\u201d\r\n\r\nBoth of them spoke up and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe didn't see no such mark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d says the old gentleman.  \u201cNow, what you _did_ see on his breast\r\nwas a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was\r\nyoung), and a W, with dashes between them, so: P--B--W\u201d--and he marked\r\nthem that way on a piece of paper.  \u201cCome, ain't that what you saw?\u201d\r\n\r\nBoth of them spoke up again, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, we _didn't_. We never seen any marks at all.\u201d\r\n\r\nWell, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe whole _bilin_' of 'm 's frauds! Le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em!\r\nle's ride 'em on a rail!\u201d and everybody was whooping at once, and there\r\nwas a rattling powwow. But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells,\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\u201cGentlemen--gentle_men!_ Hear me just a word--just a _single_ word--if you\r\n_please_! There's one way yet--let's go and dig up the corpse and look.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat took them.\r\n\r\n\u201cHooray!\u201d they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer\r\nand the doctor sung out:\r\n\r\n\u201cHold on, hold on! Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch\r\n_them_ along, too!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe'll do it!\u201d they all shouted; \u201cand if we don't find them marks we'll\r\nlynch the whole gang!\u201d\r\n\r\nI _was_ scared, now, I tell you. But there warn't no getting away, you\r\nknow. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the\r\ngraveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole\r\ntown at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nAs we went by our house I wished I hadn't sent Mary Jane out of town;\r\nbecause now if I could tip her the wink she'd light out and save me, and\r\nblow on our dead-beats.\r\n\r\nWell, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like\r\nwildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the\r\nlightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst\r\nthe leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever\r\nwas in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from\r\nwhat I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time\r\nif I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to\r\nsave me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the\r\nworld betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks. If they\r\ndidn't find them--\r\n\r\nI couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn't think\r\nabout nothing else. It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful\r\ntime to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the\r\nwrist--Hines--and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip. He\r\ndragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.\r\n\r\nWhen they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it\r\nlike an overflow. And when they got to the grave they found they had\r\nabout a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn't\r\nthought to fetch a lantern. But they sailed into digging anyway by the\r\nflicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a\r\nmile off, to borrow one.\r\n\r\nSo they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain\r\nstarted, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come\r\nbrisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took\r\nno notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute\r\nyou could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the\r\nshovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the\r\ndark wiped it all out, and you couldn't see nothing at all.\r\n\r\nAt last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then\r\nsuch another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to\r\nscrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it\r\nwas awful. Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so,\r\nand I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and\r\npanting.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare,\r\nand somebody sings out:\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the living jingo, here's the bag of gold on his breast!\u201d\r\n\r\nHines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and\r\ngive a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit\r\nout and shinned for the road in the dark there ain't nobody can tell.\r\n\r\nI had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew--leastways, I had it all\r\nto myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the\r\nbuzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of\r\nthe thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!\r\n\r\nWhen I struck the town I see there warn't nobody out in the storm, so\r\nI never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the\r\nmain one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and\r\nset it. No light there; the house all dark--which made me feel sorry and\r\ndisappointed, I didn't know why. But at last, just as I was sailing by,\r\n_flash_ comes the light in Mary Jane's window! and my heart swelled up\r\nsudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind\r\nme in the dark, and wasn't ever going to be before me no more in this\r\nworld. She _was_ the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.\r\n\r\nThe minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the\r\ntowhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first\r\ntime the lightning showed me one that wasn't chained I snatched it and\r\nshoved. It was a canoe, and warn't fastened with nothing but a rope.\r\nThe towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the\r\nmiddle of the river, but I didn't lose no time; and when I struck the\r\nraft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp\r\nif I could afforded it. But I didn't. As I sprung aboard I sung out:\r\n\r\n\u201cOut with you, Jim, and set her loose! Glory be to goodness, we're shut\r\nof them!\u201d\r\n\r\nJim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so\r\nfull of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up\r\nin my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King\r\nLear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and\r\nlights out of me. But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and\r\nbless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the\r\nking and the duke, but I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cNot now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast! Cut loose and\r\nlet her slide!\u201d\r\n\r\nSo in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it _did_\r\nseem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and\r\nnobody to bother us. I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack\r\nmy heels a few times--I couldn't help it; but about the third crack\r\nI noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath and\r\nlistened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted out\r\nover the water, here they come!--and just a-laying to their oars and\r\nmaking their skiff hum! It was the king and the duke.\r\n\r\nSo I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it was\r\nall I could do to keep from crying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar,\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\u201cTryin' to give us the slip, was ye, you pup! Tired of our company,\r\nhey?\u201d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, your majesty, we warn't--_please_ don't, your majesty!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick, then, and tell us what _was_ your idea, or I'll shake the\r\ninsides out o' you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHonest, I'll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty.\r\nThe man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying he\r\nhad a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry\r\nto see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by\r\nsurprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go\r\nof me and whispers, 'Heel it now, or they'll hang ye, sure!' and I lit\r\nout. It didn't seem no good for _me_ to stay--I couldn't do nothing,\r\nand I didn't want to be hung if I could get away. So I never stopped\r\nrunning till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry,\r\nor they'd catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the\r\nduke wasn't alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was\r\nawful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn't.\u201d\r\n\r\nJim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, \u201cOh,\r\nyes, it's _mighty_ likely!\u201d and shook me up again, and said he reckoned\r\nhe'd drownd me. But the duke says:\r\n\r\n\u201cLeggo the boy, you old idiot! Would _you_ a done any different? Did\r\nyou inquire around for _him_ when you got loose? I don't remember it.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in\r\nit. But the duke says:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou better a blame' sight give _yourself_ a good cussing, for you're\r\nthe one that's entitled to it most. You hain't done a thing from the\r\nstart that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky\r\nwith that imaginary blue-arrow mark. That _was_ bright--it was right\r\ndown bully; and it was the thing that saved us. For if it hadn't been\r\nfor that they'd a jailed us till them Englishmen's baggage come--and\r\nthen--the penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took 'em to the\r\ngraveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the\r\nexcited fools hadn't let go all holts and made that rush to get a\r\nlook we'd a slept in our cravats to-night--cravats warranted to _wear_,\r\ntoo--longer than _we'd_ need 'em.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey was still a minute--thinking; then the king says, kind of\r\nabsent-minded like:\r\n\r\n\u201cMf! And we reckoned the _niggers_ stole it!\u201d\r\n\r\nThat made me squirm!\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, \u201c_we_\r\ndid.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter about a half a minute the king drawls out:\r\n\r\n\u201cLeastways, I did.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe duke says, the same way:\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, I did.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe king kind of ruffles up, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cLooky here, Bilgewater, what'r you referrin' to?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe duke says, pretty brisk:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen it comes to that, maybe you'll let me ask, what was _you_\r\nreferring to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShucks!\u201d says the king, very sarcastic; \u201cbut I don't know--maybe you was\r\nasleep, and didn't know what you was about.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe duke bristles up now, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, let _up_ on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame' fool?\r\nDon't you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Yes_, sir! I know you _do_ know, because you done it yourself!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's a lie!\u201d--and the duke went for him. The king sings out:\r\n\r\n\u201cTake y'r hands off!--leggo my throat!--I take it all back!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe duke says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you just own up, first, that you _did_ hide that money there,\r\nintending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig\r\nit up, and have it all to yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWait jest a minute, duke--answer me this one question, honest and fair;\r\nif you didn't put the money there, say it, and I'll b'lieve you, and\r\ntake back everything I said.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou old scoundrel, I didn't, and you know I didn't. There, now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, I b'lieve you. But answer me only jest this one more--now\r\n_don't_ git mad; didn't you have it in your mind to hook the money and\r\nhide it?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don't care if I _did_, I didn't _do_ it, anyway. But you not\r\nonly had it in mind to do it, but you _done_ it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that's honest. I won't say\r\nI warn't goin' to do it, because I _was_; but you--I mean somebody--got in\r\nahead o' me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's a lie! You done it, and you got to _say_ you done it, or--\u201d\r\n\r\nThe king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:\r\n\r\n\u201c'Nough!--I _own up!_\u201d\r\n\r\nI was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier\r\nthan what I was feeling before. So the duke took his hands off and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you ever deny it again I'll drown you. It's _well_ for you to set\r\nthere and blubber like a baby--it's fitten for you, after the way\r\nyou've acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble\r\neverything--and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own\r\nfather. You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it\r\nsaddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for 'em.\r\nIt makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to _believe_\r\nthat rubbage. Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make\r\nup the deffisit--you wanted to get what money I'd got out of the Nonesuch\r\nand one thing or another, and scoop it _all_!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn't me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDry up! I don't want to hear no more out of you!\u201d says the duke.  \u201cAnd\r\n_now_ you see what you GOT by it. They've got all their own money back,\r\nand all of _ourn_ but a shekel or two _besides_. G'long to bed, and\r\ndon't you deffersit _me_ no more deffersits, long 's _you_ live!\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort,\r\nand before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an\r\nhour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the\r\nlovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other's arms. They\r\nboth got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn't get mellow\r\nenough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag\r\nagain. That made me feel easy and satisfied. Of course when they got\r\nto snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe dasn't stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along\r\ndown the river. We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty\r\nlong ways from home. We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on\r\nthem, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. It was the\r\nfirst I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and\r\ndismal. So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they\r\nbegun to work the villages again.\r\n\r\nFirst they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make enough\r\nfor them both to get drunk on. Then in another village they started\r\na dancing-school; but they didn't know no more how to dance than a\r\nkangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped\r\nin and pranced them out of town. Another time they tried to go at\r\nyellocution; but they didn't yellocute long till the audience got up and\r\ngive them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out. They tackled\r\nmissionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and\r\na little of everything; but they couldn't seem to have no luck. So at\r\nlast they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she\r\nfloated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the\r\nhalf a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.\r\n\r\nAnd at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in\r\nthe wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time.\r\nJim and me got uneasy. We didn't like the look of it. We judged they\r\nwas studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever. We turned it\r\nover and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break\r\ninto somebody's house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money\r\nbusiness, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an\r\nagreement that we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do with such\r\nactions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold\r\nshake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one morning we\r\nhid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit of\r\na shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and told\r\nus all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see\r\nif anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet. (\u201cHouse to\r\nrob, you _mean_,\u201d says I to myself; \u201cand when you get through robbing it\r\nyou'll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the\r\nraft--and you'll have to take it out in wondering.\u201d) And he said if he\r\nwarn't back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and\r\nwe was to come along.\r\n\r\nSo we stayed where we was. The duke he fretted and sweated around, and\r\nwas in a mighty sour way. He scolded us for everything, and we couldn't\r\nseem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing.\r\nSomething was a-brewing, sure. I was good and glad when midday come\r\nand no king; we could have a change, anyway--and maybe a chance for _the_\r\nchange on top of it. So me and the duke went up to the village, and\r\nhunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the\r\nback room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers\r\nbullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all\r\nhis might, and so tight he couldn't walk, and couldn't do nothing to\r\nthem. The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king\r\nbegun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and\r\nshook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like\r\na deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a\r\nlong day before they ever see me and Jim again. I got down there all\r\nout of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:\r\n\r\n\u201cSet her loose, Jim! we're all right now!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut there warn't no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam. Jim was\r\ngone! I set up a shout--and then another--and then another one; and run\r\nthis way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn't\r\nno use--old Jim was gone. Then I set down and cried; I couldn't help\r\nit. But I couldn't set still long. Pretty soon I went out on the road,\r\ntrying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy walking, and\r\nasked him if he'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhereabouts?\u201d says I.\r\n\r\n\u201cDown to Silas Phelps' place, two mile below here. He's a runaway\r\nnigger, and they've got him. Was you looking for him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou bet I ain't! I run across him in the woods about an hour or two\r\nago, and he said if I hollered he'd cut my livers out--and told me to lay\r\ndown and stay where I was; and I done it. Been there ever since; afeard\r\nto come out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cyou needn't be afeard no more, becuz they've got him.\r\nHe run off f'm down South, som'ers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's a good job they got him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I _reckon_! There's two hunderd dollars reward on him. It's\r\nlike picking up money out'n the road.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it is--and I could a had it if I'd been big enough; I see him\r\n_first_. Who nailed him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was an old fellow--a stranger--and he sold out his chance in him for\r\nforty dollars, becuz he's got to go up the river and can't wait. Think\r\no' that, now! You bet _I'd_ wait, if it was seven year.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat's me, every time,\u201d says I.  \u201cBut maybe his chance ain't worth\r\nno more than that, if he'll sell it so cheap. Maybe there's something\r\nain't straight about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it _is_, though--straight as a string. I see the handbill myself.\r\nIt tells all about him, to a dot--paints him like a picture, and tells\r\nthe plantation he's frum, below Newr_leans_. No-sirree-_bob_, they\r\nain't no trouble 'bout _that_ speculation, you bet you. Say, gimme a\r\nchaw tobacker, won't ye?\u201d\r\n\r\nI didn't have none, so he left. I went to the raft, and set down in the\r\nwigwam to think. But I couldn't come to nothing. I thought till I wore\r\nmy head sore, but I couldn't see no way out of the trouble. After all\r\nthis long journey, and after all we'd done for them scoundrels, here it\r\nwas all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined, because\r\nthey could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and make\r\nhim a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for forty\r\ndirty dollars.\r\n\r\nOnce I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to\r\nbe a slave at home where his family was, as long as he'd _got_ to be a\r\nslave, and so I'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to\r\ntell Miss Watson where he was. But I soon give up that notion for two\r\nthings: she'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness\r\nfor leaving her, and so she'd sell him straight down the river again;\r\nand if she didn't, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger,\r\nand they'd make Jim feel it all the time, and so he'd feel ornery and\r\ndisgraced. And then think of _me_! It would get all around that Huck\r\nFinn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see\r\nanybody from that town again I'd be ready to get down and lick his boots\r\nfor shame. That's just the way: a person does a low-down thing, and\r\nthen he don't want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he\r\ncan hide it, it ain't no disgrace. That was my fix exactly. The more I\r\nstudied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the\r\nmore wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when\r\nit hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence\r\nslapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being\r\nwatched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a\r\npoor old woman's nigger that hadn't ever done me no harm, and now was\r\nshowing me there's One that's always on the lookout, and ain't a-going\r\nto allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further,\r\nI most dropped in my tracks I was so scared. Well, I tried the best I\r\ncould to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung\r\nup wicked, and so I warn't so much to blame; but something inside of me\r\nkept saying, \u201cThere was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and\r\nif you'd a done it they'd a learnt you there that people that acts as\r\nI'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt made me shiver. And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I\r\ncouldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better. So\r\nI kneeled down. But the words wouldn't come. Why wouldn't they? It\r\nwarn't no use to try and hide it from Him. Nor from _me_, neither. I\r\nknowed very well why they wouldn't come. It was because my heart warn't\r\nright; it was because I warn't square; it was because I was playing\r\ndouble. I was letting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of me I was\r\nholding on to the biggest one of all. I was trying to make my mouth\r\n_say_ I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write\r\nto that nigger's owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I\r\nknowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. You can't pray a lie--I found\r\nthat out.\r\n\r\nSo I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know what to\r\ndo. At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write the letter--and\r\nthen see if I can pray. Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as\r\nlight as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone. So I\r\ngot a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down\r\nand wrote:\r\n\r\nMiss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below\r\nPikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the\r\nreward if you send.\r\n\r\n_Huck Finn._\r\n\r\nI felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever\r\nfelt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn't do it\r\nstraight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking\r\nhow good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost\r\nand going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our\r\ntrip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day\r\nand in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we\r\na-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I\r\ncouldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the\r\nother kind. I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of\r\ncalling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when\r\nI come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp,\r\nup there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call\r\nme honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how\r\ngood he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling\r\nthe men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was\r\nthe best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one he's\r\ngot now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.\r\n\r\nIt was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was\r\na-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and\r\nI knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then\r\nsays to myself:\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, then, I'll _go_ to hell\u201d--and tore it up.\r\n\r\nIt was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let\r\nthem stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the\r\nwhole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,\r\nwhich was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't. And\r\nfor a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;\r\nand if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as\r\nlong as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.\r\n\r\nThen I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some\r\nconsiderable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that\r\nsuited me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down\r\nthe river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my\r\nraft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. I slept the\r\nnight through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast,\r\nand put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or\r\nanother in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. I landed\r\nbelow where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods,\r\nand then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and\r\nsunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter\r\nof a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.\r\n\r\nThen I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on\r\nit, \u201cPhelps's Sawmill,\u201d and when I come to the farm-houses, two or\r\nthree hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't\r\nsee nobody around, though it was good daylight now. But I didn't mind,\r\nbecause I didn't want to see nobody just yet--I only wanted to get the\r\nlay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from\r\nthe village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved along,\r\nstraight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was\r\nthe duke. He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch--three-night\r\nperformance--like that other time. They had the cheek, them frauds! I\r\nwas right on him before I could shirk. He looked astonished, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHel-_lo_! Where'd _you_ come from?\u201d Then he says, kind of glad and\r\neager, \u201cWhere's the raft?--got her in a good place?\u201d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, that's just what I was going to ask your grace.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen he didn't look so joyful, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat was your idea for asking _me_?\u201d he says.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I says, \u201cwhen I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says\r\nto myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I went\r\na-loafing around town to put in the time and wait. A man up and offered\r\nme ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch\r\na sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat,\r\nand the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him\r\nalong, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after\r\nhim. We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the\r\ncountry till we tired him out. We never got him till dark; then we\r\nfetched him over, and I started down for the raft. When I got there and\r\nsee it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into trouble and had to\r\nleave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger I've got in\r\nthe world, and now I'm in a strange country, and ain't got no property\r\nno more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;' so I set down and\r\ncried. I slept in the woods all night. But what _did_ become of the\r\nraft, then?--and Jim--poor Jim!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBlamed if I know--that is, what's become of the raft. That old fool had\r\nmade a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery\r\nthe loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but\r\nwhat he'd spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and\r\nfound the raft gone, we said, 'That little rascal has stole our raft and\r\nshook us, and run off down the river.'\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wouldn't shake my _nigger_, would I?--the only nigger I had in the\r\nworld, and the only property.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe never thought of that. Fact is, I reckon we'd come to consider him\r\n_our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so--goodness knows we had trouble\r\nenough for him. So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke,\r\nthere warn't anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another\r\nshake. And I've pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn. Where's\r\nthat ten cents? Give it here.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to\r\nspend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the\r\nmoney I had, and I hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday. He never\r\nsaid nothing. The next minute he whirls on me and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you reckon that nigger would blow on us? We'd skin him if he done\r\nthat!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can he blow? Hain't he run off?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money's\r\ngone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Sold_ him?\u201d I says, and begun to cry; \u201cwhy, he was _my_ nigger, and\r\nthat was my money. Where is he?--I want my nigger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you can't _get_ your nigger, that's all--so dry up your\r\nblubbering. Looky here--do you think _you'd_ venture to blow on us?\r\nBlamed if I think I'd trust you. Why, if you _was_ to blow on us--\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes\r\nbefore. I went on a-whimpering, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't got no time to blow, nohow.\r\nI got to turn out and find my nigger.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on\r\nhis arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead. At last he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI'll tell you something. We got to be here three days. If you'll\r\npromise you won't blow, and won't let the nigger blow, I'll tell you\r\nwhere to find him.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo I promised, and he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cA farmer by the name of Silas Ph--\u201d and then he stopped. You see, he\r\nstarted to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to\r\nstudy and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind. And so he\r\nwas. He wouldn't trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of\r\nthe way the whole three days. So pretty soon he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man that bought him is named Abram Foster--Abram G. Foster--and he\r\nlives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I says, \u201cI can walk it in three days. And I'll start this\r\nvery afternoon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo you wont, you'll start _now_; and don't you lose any time about it,\r\nneither, nor do any gabbling by the way. Just keep a tight tongue in\r\nyour head and move right along, and then you won't get into trouble with\r\n_us_, d'ye hear?\u201d\r\n\r\nThat was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for. I\r\nwanted to be left free to work my plans.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo clear out,\u201d he says; \u201cand you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want\r\nto. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger--some\r\nidiots don't require documents--leastways I've heard there's such down\r\nSouth here. And when you tell him the handbill and the reward's bogus,\r\nmaybe he'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for\r\ngetting 'em out. Go 'long now, and tell him anything you want to; but\r\nmind you don't work your jaw any _between_ here and there.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo I left, and struck for the back country. I didn't look around, but I\r\nkinder felt like he was watching me. But I knowed I could tire him out\r\nat that. I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before\r\nI stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps'. I\r\nreckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling\r\naround, because I wanted to stop Jim's mouth till these fellows could\r\nget away. I didn't want no trouble with their kind. I'd seen all I\r\nwanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny;\r\nthe hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint\r\ndronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and\r\nlike everybody's dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers\r\nthe leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it's\r\nspirits whispering--spirits that's been dead ever so many years--and you\r\nalways think they're talking about _you_. As a general thing it makes a\r\nbody wish _he_ was dead, too, and done with it all.\r\n\r\nPhelps' was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and they\r\nall look alike. A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out\r\nof logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different\r\nlength, to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand on when\r\nthey are going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches in the\r\nbig yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the\r\nnap rubbed off; big double log-house for the white folks--hewed logs,\r\nwith the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes\r\nbeen whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big\r\nbroad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house\r\nback of the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t'other\r\nside the smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down against\r\nthe back fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side;\r\nash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by\r\nthe kitchen door, with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there\r\nin the sun; more hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees away\r\noff in a corner; some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place\r\nby the fence; outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then\r\nthe cotton fields begins, and after the fields the woods.\r\n\r\nI went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and\r\nstarted for the kitchen. When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum\r\nof a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again;\r\nand then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead--for that _is_ the\r\nlonesomest sound in the whole world.\r\n\r\nI went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting\r\nto Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for\r\nI'd noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth\r\nif I left it alone.\r\n\r\nWhen I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went\r\nfor me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still. And\r\nsuch another powwow as they made! In a quarter of a minute I was a kind\r\nof a hub of a wheel, as you may say--spokes made out of dogs--circle of\r\nfifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses\r\nstretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you\r\ncould see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.\r\n\r\nA nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her\r\nhand, singing out, \u201cBegone _you_ Tige! you Spot! begone sah!\u201d and she\r\nfetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling,\r\nand then the rest followed; and the next second half of them come back,\r\nwagging their tails around me, and making friends with me. There ain't\r\nno harm in a hound, nohow.\r\n\r\nAnd behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger\r\nboys without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to their\r\nmother's gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way\r\nthey always do. And here comes the white woman running from the house,\r\nabout forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick\r\nin her hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting the\r\nsame way the little niggers was doing. She was smiling all over so she\r\ncould hardly stand--and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's _you_, at last!--_ain't_ it?\u201d\r\n\r\nI out with a \u201cYes'm\u201d before I thought.\r\n\r\nShe grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands\r\nand shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over;\r\nand she couldn't seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, \u201cYou\r\ndon't look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but law\r\nsakes, I don't care for that, I'm so glad to see you! Dear, dear, it\r\ndoes seem like I could eat you up! Children, it's your cousin Tom!--tell\r\nhim howdy.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, and\r\nhid behind her. So she run on:\r\n\r\n\u201cLize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away--or did you get\r\nyour breakfast on the boat?\u201d\r\n\r\nI said I had got it on the boat. So then she started for the house,\r\nleading me by the hand, and the children tagging after. When we got\r\nthere she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on\r\na little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow I can have a _good_ look at you; and, laws-a-me, I've been hungry\r\nfor it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it's come\r\nat last! We been expecting you a couple of days and more. What kep'\r\nyou?--boat get aground?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes'm--she--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon't say yes'm--say Aunt Sally. Where'd she get aground?\u201d\r\n\r\nI didn't rightly know what to say, because I didn't know whether the\r\nboat would be coming up the river or down. But I go a good deal on\r\ninstinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up--from down towards\r\nOrleans. That didn't help me much, though; for I didn't know the names\r\nof bars down that way. I see I'd got to invent a bar, or forget the\r\nname of the one we got aground on--or--Now I struck an idea, and fetched\r\nit out:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt warn't the grounding--that didn't keep us back but a little. We\r\nblowed out a cylinder-head.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood gracious! anybody hurt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo'm. Killed a nigger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it's lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt. Two years ago\r\nlast Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old\r\nLally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man. And\r\nI think he died afterwards. He was a Baptist. Your uncle Silas knowed\r\na family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well. Yes, I\r\nremember now, he _did_ die. Mortification set in, and they had to\r\namputate him. But it didn't save him. Yes, it was mortification--that\r\nwas it. He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious\r\nresurrection. They say he was a sight to look at. Your uncle's been up\r\nto the town every day to fetch you. And he's gone again, not more'n an\r\nhour ago; he'll be back any minute now. You must a met him on the road,\r\ndidn't you?--oldish man, with a--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I didn't see nobody, Aunt Sally. The boat landed just at daylight,\r\nand I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the town\r\nand out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not get here too\r\nsoon; and so I come down the back way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho'd you give the baggage to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNobody.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, child, it 'll be stole!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot where I hid it I reckon it won't,\u201d I says.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was kinder thin ice, but I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe captain see me standing around, and told me I better have something\r\nto eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers'\r\nlunch, and give me all I wanted.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was getting so uneasy I couldn't listen good. I had my mind on the\r\nchildren all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump\r\nthem a little, and find out who I was. But I couldn't get no show, Mrs.\r\nPhelps kept it up and run on so. Pretty soon she made the cold chills\r\nstreak all down my back, because she says:\r\n\r\n\u201cBut here we're a-running on this way, and you hain't told me a word\r\nabout Sis, nor any of them. Now I'll rest my works a little, and you\r\nstart up yourn; just tell me _everything_--tell me all about 'm all every\r\none of 'm; and how they are, and what they're doing, and what they told\r\nyou to tell me; and every last thing you can think of.\u201d\r\n\r\nWell, I see I was up a stump--and up it good. Providence had stood by\r\nme this fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now. I see it\r\nwarn't a bit of use to try to go ahead--I'd got to throw up my hand. So\r\nI says to myself, here's another place where I got to resk the truth.\r\nI opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind\r\nthe bed, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHere he comes! Stick your head down lower--there, that'll do; you can't\r\nbe seen now. Don't you let on you're here. I'll play a joke on him.\r\nChildren, don't you say a word.\u201d\r\n\r\nI see I was in a fix now. But it warn't no use to worry; there warn't\r\nnothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to stand from\r\nunder when the lightning struck.\r\n\r\nI had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in; then\r\nthe bed hid him. Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHas he come?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d says her husband.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-_ness_ gracious!\u201d she says, \u201cwhat in the warld can have become of\r\nhim?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can't imagine,\u201d says the old gentleman; \u201cand I must say it makes me\r\ndreadful uneasy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUneasy!\u201d she says; \u201cI'm ready to go distracted! He _must_ a come; and\r\nyou've missed him along the road. I _know_ it's so--something tells me\r\nso.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Sally, I _couldn't_ miss him along the road--_you_ know that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut oh, dear, dear, what _will_ Sis say! He must a come! You must a\r\nmissed him. He--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, don't distress me any more'n I'm already distressed. I don't know\r\nwhat in the world to make of it. I'm at my wit's end, and I don't mind\r\nacknowledging 't I'm right down scared. But there's no hope that he's\r\ncome; for he _couldn't_ come and me miss him. Sally, it's terrible--just\r\nterrible--something's happened to the boat, sure!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Silas! Look yonder!--up the road!--ain't that somebody coming?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs.\r\nPhelps the chance she wanted. She stooped down quick at the foot of the\r\nbed and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the\r\nwindow there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and\r\nI standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside. The old gentleman stared,\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, who's that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho do you reckon 't is?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hain't no idea. Who _is_ it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's _Tom Sawyer!_\u201d\r\n\r\nBy jings, I most slumped through the floor! But there warn't no time to\r\nswap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on\r\nshaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and\r\ncry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary,\r\nand the rest of the tribe.\r\n\r\nBut if they was joyful, it warn't nothing to what I was; for it was like\r\nbeing born again, I was so glad to find out who I was. Well, they froze\r\nto me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it couldn't\r\nhardly go any more, I had told them more about my family--I mean the\r\nSawyer family--than ever happened to any six Sawyer families. And I\r\nexplained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of\r\nWhite River, and it took us three days to fix it. Which was all right,\r\nand worked first-rate; because _they_ didn't know but what it would take\r\nthree days to fix it. If I'd a called it a bolthead it would a done\r\njust as well.\r\n\r\nNow I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty\r\nuncomfortable all up the other. Being Tom Sawyer was easy and\r\ncomfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a\r\nsteamboat coughing along down the river. Then I says to myself, s'pose\r\nTom Sawyer comes down on that boat? And s'pose he steps in here any\r\nminute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep\r\nquiet?\r\n\r\nWell, I couldn't _have_ it that way; it wouldn't do at all. I must go\r\nup the road and waylay him. So I told the folks I reckoned I would go\r\nup to the town and fetch down my baggage. The old gentleman was for\r\ngoing along with me, but I said no, I could drive the horse myself, and\r\nI druther he wouldn't take no trouble about me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see a\r\nwagon coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopped and\r\nwaited till he come along. I says \u201cHold on!\u201d and it stopped alongside,\r\nand his mouth opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he swallowed\r\ntwo or three times like a person that's got a dry throat, and then says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI hain't ever done you no harm. You know that. So, then, what you\r\nwant to come back and ha'nt _me_ for?\u201d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI hain't come back--I hain't been _gone_.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn't quite\r\nsatisfied yet. He says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDon't you play nothing on me, because I wouldn't on you. Honest injun\r\nnow, you ain't a ghost?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHonest injun, I ain't,\u201d I says.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell--I--I--well, that ought to settle it, of course; but I can't somehow\r\nseem to understand it no way. Looky here, warn't you ever murdered _at\r\nall?_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. I warn't ever murdered at all--I played it on them. You come in\r\nhere and feel of me if you don't believe me.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me\r\nagain he didn't know what to do. And he wanted to know all about it\r\nright off, because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it\r\nhit him where he lived. But I said, leave it alone till by and by; and\r\ntold his driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told\r\nhim the kind of a fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do? He\r\nsaid, let him alone a minute, and don't disturb him. So he thought and\r\nthought, and pretty soon he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's all right; I've got it. Take my trunk in your wagon, and let on\r\nit's your'n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to the\r\nhouse about the time you ought to; and I'll go towards town a piece, and\r\ntake a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you;\r\nand you needn't let on to know me at first.\u201d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right; but wait a minute. There's one more thing--a thing that\r\n_nobody_ don't know but me. And that is, there's a nigger here that\r\nI'm a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his name is _Jim_--old Miss\r\nWatson's Jim.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! Why, Jim is--\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stopped and went to studying. I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI know what you'll say. You'll say it's dirty, low-down business; but\r\nwhat if it is? I'm low down; and I'm a-going to steal him, and I want\r\nyou keep mum and not let on. Will you?\u201d\r\n\r\nHis eye lit up, and he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI'll _help_ you steal him!\u201d\r\n\r\nWell, I let go all holts then, like I was shot. It was the most\r\nastonishing speech I ever heard--and I'm bound to say Tom Sawyer fell\r\nconsiderable in my estimation. Only I couldn't believe it. Tom Sawyer\r\na _nigger-stealer!_\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, shucks!\u201d I says; \u201cyou're joking.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI ain't joking, either.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d I says, \u201cjoking or no joking, if you hear anything said\r\nabout a runaway nigger, don't forget to remember that _you_ don't know\r\nnothing about him, and I don't know nothing about him.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his\r\nway and I drove mine. But of course I forgot all about driving slow on\r\naccounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too\r\nquick for that length of a trip. The old gentleman was at the door, and\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, this is wonderful! Whoever would a thought it was in that mare\r\nto do it? I wish we'd a timed her. And she hain't sweated a hair--not\r\na hair. It's wonderful. Why, I wouldn't take a hundred dollars for that\r\nhorse now--I wouldn't, honest; and yet I'd a sold her for fifteen before,\r\nand thought 'twas all she was worth.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat's all he said. He was the innocentest, best old soul I ever see.\r\nBut it warn't surprising; because he warn't only just a farmer, he was\r\na preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of the\r\nplantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church\r\nand schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it was\r\nworth it, too. There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that, and\r\ndone the same way, down South.\r\n\r\nIn about half an hour Tom's wagon drove up to the front stile, and Aunt\r\nSally she see it through the window, because it was only about fifty\r\nyards, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, there's somebody come! I wonder who 'tis? Why, I do believe it's\r\na stranger. Jimmy\u201d (that's one of the children) \u201crun and tell Lize to\r\nput on another plate for dinner.\u201d\r\n\r\nEverybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger\r\ndon't come _every_ year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for\r\ninterest, when he does come. Tom was over the stile and starting for\r\nthe house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we\r\nwas all bunched in the front door. Tom had his store clothes on, and an\r\naudience--and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer. In them circumstances\r\nit warn't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was\r\nsuitable. He warn't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep; no,\r\nhe come ca'm and important, like the ram. When he got a-front of us he\r\nlifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was the lid of a box\r\nthat had butterflies asleep in it and he didn't want to disturb them,\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, my boy,\u201d says the old gentleman, \u201cI'm sorry to say 't your driver\r\nhas deceived you; Nichols's place is down a matter of three mile more.\r\nCome in, come in.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, \u201cToo late--he's out\r\nof sight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he's gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your dinner with\r\nus; and then we'll hitch up and take you down to Nichols's.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I _can't_ make you so much trouble; I couldn't think of it. I'll\r\nwalk--I don't mind the distance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut we won't _let_ you walk--it wouldn't be Southern hospitality to do\r\nit. Come right in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, _do_,\u201d says Aunt Sally; \u201cit ain't a bit of trouble to us, not a\r\nbit in the world. You must stay. It's a long, dusty three mile, and\r\nwe can't let you walk. And, besides, I've already told 'em to put on\r\nanother plate when I see you coming; so you mustn't disappoint us. Come\r\nright in and make yourself at home.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be\r\npersuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger\r\nfrom Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson--and he made\r\nanother bow.\r\n\r\nWell, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and\r\neverybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and\r\nwondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last,\r\nstill talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the\r\nmouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was\r\ngoing on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of\r\nher hand, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou owdacious puppy!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked kind of hurt, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm surprised at you, m'am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou're s'rp--Why, what do you reckon I am? I've a good notion to take\r\nand--Say, what do you mean by kissing me?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked kind of humble, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn't mean nothing, m'am. I didn't mean no harm. I--I--thought you'd\r\nlike it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you born fool!\u201d She took up the spinning stick, and it looked\r\nlike it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it.\r\n \u201cWhat made you think I'd like it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don't know. Only, they--they--told me you would.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_They_ told you I would. Whoever told you's _another_ lunatic. I\r\nnever heard the beat of it. Who's _they_?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, everybody. They all said so, m'am.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her\r\nfingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWho's 'everybody'? Out with their names, or ther'll be an idiot\r\nshort.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm sorry, and I warn't expecting it. They told me to. They all told\r\nme to. They all said, kiss her; and said she'd like it. They all said\r\nit--every one of them. But I'm sorry, m'am, and I won't do it no more--I\r\nwon't, honest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou won't, won't you? Well, I sh'd _reckon_ you won't!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo'm, I'm honest about it; I won't ever do it again--till you ask me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTill I _ask_ you! Well, I never see the beat of it in my born days!\r\nI lay you'll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask\r\nyou--or the likes of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cit does surprise me so. I can't make it out, somehow.\r\nThey said you would, and I thought you would. But--\u201d He stopped and\r\nlooked around slow, like he wished he could run across a friendly eye\r\nsomewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman's, and says, \u201cDidn't\r\n_you_ think she'd like me to kiss her, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, no; I--I--well, no, I b'lieve I didn't.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen he looks on around the same way to me, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, didn't _you_ think Aunt Sally 'd open out her arms and say, 'Sid\r\nSawyer--'\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy land!\u201d she says, breaking in and jumping for him, \u201cyou impudent\r\nyoung rascal, to fool a body so--\u201d and was going to hug him, but he\r\nfended her off, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, not till you've asked me first.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo she didn't lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed\r\nhim over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and he\r\ntook what was left. And after they got a little quiet again she says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, dear me, I never see such a surprise. We warn't looking for _you_\r\nat all, but only Tom. Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but\r\nhim.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's because it warn't _intended_ for any of us to come but Tom,\u201d he\r\nsays; \u201cbut I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let me\r\ncome, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a\r\nfirst-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for me\r\nto by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger. But it\r\nwas a mistake, Aunt Sally. This ain't no healthy place for a stranger\r\nto come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo--not impudent whelps, Sid. You ought to had your jaws boxed; I\r\nhain't been so put out since I don't know when. But I don't care, I\r\ndon't mind the terms--I'd be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to\r\nhave you here. Well, to think of that performance! I don't deny it, I\r\nwas most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and\r\nthe kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven\r\nfamilies--and all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that's laid\r\nin a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of\r\nold cold cannibal in the morning. Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long\r\nblessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn't cool it a bit,\r\nneither, the way I've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.\r\nThere was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me\r\nand Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn't no use, they\r\ndidn't happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid\r\nto try to work up to it. But at supper, at night, one of the little\r\nboys says:\r\n\r\n\u201cPa, mayn't Tom and Sid and me go to the show?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d says the old man, \u201cI reckon there ain't going to be any; and you\r\ncouldn't go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and\r\nme all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the\r\npeople; so I reckon they've drove the owdacious loafers out of town\r\nbefore this time.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo there it was!--but I couldn't help it. Tom and me was to sleep in the\r\nsame room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and went up to\r\nbed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the\r\nlightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn't believe anybody was\r\ngoing to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn't hurry up\r\nand give them one they'd get into trouble sure.\r\n\r\nOn the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered,\r\nand how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn't come back no more, and\r\nwhat a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our\r\nRoyal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had\r\ntime to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of\r\nit--it was as much as half-after eight, then--here comes a raging rush of\r\npeople with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin\r\npans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by;\r\nand as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a\r\nrail--that is, I knowed it _was_ the king and the duke, though they was\r\nall over tar and feathers, and didn't look like nothing in the\r\nworld that was human--just looked like a couple of monstrous big\r\nsoldier-plumes. Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for\r\nthem poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn't ever feel any\r\nhardness against them any more in the world. It was a dreadful thing to\r\nsee. Human beings _can_ be awful cruel to one another.\r\n\r\nWe see we was too late--couldn't do no good. We asked some stragglers\r\nabout it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very\r\ninnocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the\r\nmiddle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and\r\nthe house rose up and went for them.\r\n\r\nSo we poked along back home, and I warn't feeling so brash as I was\r\nbefore, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow--though\r\nI hadn't done nothing. But that's always the way; it don't make no\r\ndifference whether you do right or wrong, a person's conscience ain't\r\ngot no sense, and just goes for him anyway. If I had a yaller dog that\r\ndidn't know no more than a person's conscience does I would pison him.\r\nIt takes up more room than all the rest of a person's insides, and yet\r\nain't no good, nohow. Tom Sawyer he says the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe stopped talking, and got to thinking. By and by Tom says:\r\n\r\n\u201cLooky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before! I bet I\r\nknow where Jim is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! Where?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn that hut down by the ash-hopper. Why, looky here. When we was at\r\ndinner, didn't you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you think the vittles was for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor a dog.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo 'd I. Well, it wasn't for a dog.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause part of it was watermelon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo it was--I noticed it. Well, it does beat all that I never thought\r\nabout a dog not eating watermelon. It shows how a body can see and\r\ndon't see at the same time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it\r\nagain when he came out. He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up\r\nfrom table--same key, I bet. Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner;\r\nand it ain't likely there's two prisoners on such a little plantation,\r\nand where the people's all so kind and good. Jim's the prisoner. All\r\nright--I'm glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn't give shucks\r\nfor any other way. Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to\r\nsteal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we'll take the one we like\r\nthe best.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat a head for just a boy to have! If I had Tom Sawyer's head I\r\nwouldn't trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown\r\nin a circus, nor nothing I can think of. I went to thinking out a plan,\r\nbut only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right\r\nplan was going to come from. Pretty soon Tom says:\r\n\r\n\u201cReady?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I says.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right--bring it out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy plan is this,\u201d I says.  \u201cWe can easy find out if it's Jim in there.\r\nThen get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the\r\nisland. Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the\r\nold man's britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river\r\non the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and\r\nJim used to do before. Wouldn't that plan work?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Work_? Why, cert'nly it would work, like rats a-fighting. But it's\r\ntoo blame' simple; there ain't nothing _to_ it. What's the good of a\r\nplan that ain't no more trouble than that? It's as mild as goose-milk.\r\nWhy, Huck, it wouldn't make no more talk than breaking into a soap\r\nfactory.\u201d\r\n\r\nI never said nothing, because I warn't expecting nothing different; but\r\nI knowed mighty well that whenever he got _his_ plan ready it wouldn't\r\nhave none of them objections to it.\r\n\r\nAnd it didn't. He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was\r\nworth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man\r\nas mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was satisfied,\r\nand said we would waltz in on it. I needn't tell what it was here,\r\nbecause I knowed it wouldn't stay the way, it was. I knowed he would be\r\nchanging it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new\r\nbullinesses wherever he got a chance. And that is what he done.\r\n\r\nWell, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in\r\nearnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.\r\nThat was the thing that was too many for me. Here was a boy that was\r\nrespectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at\r\nhome that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and\r\nknowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was,\r\nwithout any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to\r\nthis business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame,\r\nbefore everybody. I _couldn't_ understand it no way at all. It was\r\noutrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be\r\nhis true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save\r\nhimself. And I _did_ start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDon't you reckon I know what I'm about? Don't I generly know what I'm\r\nabout?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDidn't I _say_ I was going to help steal the nigger?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Well_, then.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat's all he said, and that's all I said. It warn't no use to say any\r\nmore; because when he said he'd do a thing, he always done it. But I\r\ncouldn't make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just\r\nlet it go, and never bothered no more about it. If he was bound to have\r\nit so, I couldn't help it.\r\n\r\nWhen we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to\r\nthe hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it. We went through the yard\r\nso as to see what the hounds would do. They knowed us, and didn't make\r\nno more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by\r\nin the night. When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and\r\nthe two sides; and on the side I warn't acquainted with--which was the\r\nnorth side--we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just\r\none stout board nailed across it. I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHere's the ticket. This hole's big enough for Jim to get through if we\r\nwrench off the board.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom says:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as\r\nplaying hooky. I should _hope_ we can find a way that's a little more\r\ncomplicated than _that_, Huck Finn.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d I says, \u201chow 'll it do to saw him out, the way I done\r\nbefore I was murdered that time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat's more _like_,\u201d he says.  \u201cIt's real mysterious, and troublesome,\r\nand good,\u201d he says; \u201cbut I bet we can find a way that's twice as long.\r\nThere ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking around.\u201d\r\n\r\nBetwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that\r\njoined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. It was as long\r\nas the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide. The door to it was at\r\nthe south end, and was padlocked. Tom he went to the soap-kettle and\r\nsearched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;\r\nso he took it and prized out one of the staples. The chain fell down,\r\nand we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match,\r\nand see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no connection\r\nwith it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but\r\nsome old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.\r\nThe match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and\r\nthe door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful. He says;\r\n\r\n\u201cNow we're all right. We'll _dig_ him out. It 'll take about a week!\u201d\r\n\r\nThen we started for the house, and I went in the back door--you only have\r\nto pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doors--but that\r\nwarn't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must\r\nclimb up the lightning-rod. But after he got up half way about three\r\ntimes, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most\r\nbusted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but after he\r\nwas rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this\r\ntime he made the trip.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins\r\nto pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim--if it\r\n_was_ Jim that was being fed. The niggers was just getting through\r\nbreakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim's nigger was piling up\r\na tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was\r\nleaving, the key come from the house.\r\n\r\nThis nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was\r\nall tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches\r\noff. He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and\r\nmaking him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of\r\nstrange words and noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched so\r\nlong before in his life. He got so worked up, and got to running on so\r\nabout his troubles, he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do.\r\nSo Tom says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat's the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you\r\nheave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Mars Sid, A dog. Cur'us dog, too. Does you want to go en look at\r\n'im?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\nI hunched Tom, and whispers:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou going, right here in the daybreak? _that_ warn't the plan.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it warn't; but it's the plan _now_.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo, drat him, we went along, but I didn't like it much. When we got in\r\nwe couldn't hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure\r\nenough, and could see us; and he sings out:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, _Huck_! En good _lan_'! ain' dat Misto Tom?\u201d\r\n\r\nI just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. I didn't know\r\nnothing to do; and if I had I couldn't a done it, because that nigger\r\nbusted in and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?\u201d\r\n\r\nWe could see pretty well now. Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and\r\nkind of wondering, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes _who_ know us?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, dis-yer runaway nigger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't reckon he does; but what put that into your head?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat _put_ it dar? Didn' he jis' dis minute sing out like he knowed\r\nyou?\u201d\r\n\r\nTom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that's mighty curious. _Who_ sung out? _when_ did he sing out?\r\n_what_ did he sing out?\u201d And turns to me, perfectly ca'm, and says,\r\n\u201cDid _you_ hear anybody sing out?\u201d\r\n\r\nOf course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; I ain't heard nobody say nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you sing out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sah,\u201d says Jim; \u201cI hain't said nothing, sah.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a word?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sah, I hain't said a word.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you ever see us before?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sah; not as I knows on.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and\r\nsays, kind of severe:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you reckon's the matter with you, anyway? What made you think\r\nsomebody sung out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it's de dad-blame' witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do.\r\nDey's awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos' kill me, dey sk'yers me so.\r\nPlease to don't tell nobody 'bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he'll scole\r\nme; 'kase he say dey _ain't_ no witches. I jis' wish to goodness he was\r\nheah now--_den_ what would he say! I jis' bet he couldn' fine no way to\r\ngit aroun' it _dis_ time. But it's awluz jis' so; people dat's _sot_,\r\nstays sot; dey won't look into noth'n'en fine it out f'r deyselves, en\r\nwhen _you_ fine it out en tell um 'bout it, dey doan' b'lieve you.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom give him a dime, and said we wouldn't tell nobody; and told him to\r\nbuy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger. If I was to\r\ncatch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn't give\r\nhim up, I'd hang him.\u201d And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to\r\nlook at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDon't ever let on to know us. And if you hear any digging going on\r\nnights, it's us; we're going to set you free.\u201d\r\n\r\nJim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger\r\ncome back, and we said we'd come again some time if the nigger wanted\r\nus to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the\r\nwitches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks\r\naround then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down\r\ninto the woods; because Tom said we got to have _some_ light to see how\r\nto dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble;\r\nwhat we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that's called\r\nfox-fire, and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a\r\ndark place. We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down\r\nto rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied:\r\n\r\n\u201cBlame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be.\r\nAnd so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan.\r\nThere ain't no watchman to be drugged--now there _ought_ to be a\r\nwatchman. There ain't even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to. And\r\nthere's Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his\r\nbed: why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off\r\nthe chain. And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the\r\npunkin-headed nigger, and don't send nobody to watch the nigger. Jim\r\ncould a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn't be\r\nno use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg. Why, drat it,\r\nHuck, it's the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent _all_\r\nthe difficulties. Well, we can't help it; we got to do the best we can\r\nwith the materials we've got. Anyhow, there's one thing--there's more\r\nhonor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers,\r\nwhere there warn't one of them furnished to you by the people who it was\r\ntheir duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your\r\nown head. Now look at just that one thing of the lantern. When you\r\ncome down to the cold facts, we simply got to _let on_ that a lantern's\r\nresky. Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to,\r\nI believe. Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up something to\r\nmake a saw out of the first chance we get.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do we want of a saw?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do we _want_ of it? Hain't we got to saw the leg of Jim's bed\r\noff, so as to get the chain loose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain\r\noff.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, if that ain't just like you, Huck Finn. You _can_ get up the\r\ninfant-schooliest ways of going at a thing. Why, hain't you ever read\r\nany books at all?--Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny,\r\nnor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes? Who ever heard of getting a\r\nprisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that? No; the way all the\r\nbest authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it just\r\nso, and swallow the sawdust, so it can't be found, and put some dirt and\r\ngrease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can't see\r\nno sign of it's being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound.\r\nThen, the night you're ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip\r\noff your chain, and there you are. Nothing to do but hitch your\r\nrope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the\r\nmoat--because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know--and\r\nthere's your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and\r\nfling you across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or\r\nNavarre, or wherever it is. It's gaudy, Huck. I wish there was a moat\r\nto this cabin. If we get time, the night of the escape, we'll dig one.\u201d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do we want of a moat when we're going to snake him out from under\r\nthe cabin?\u201d\r\n\r\nBut he never heard me. He had forgot me and everything else. He had\r\nhis chin in his hand, thinking. Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his\r\nhead; then sighs again, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it wouldn't do--there ain't necessity enough for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor what?\u201d I says.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, to saw Jim's leg off,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood land!\u201d I says; \u201cwhy, there ain't _no_ necessity for it. And what\r\nwould you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, some of the best authorities has done it. They couldn't get the\r\nchain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved. And a leg would\r\nbe better still. But we got to let that go. There ain't necessity\r\nenough in this case; and, besides, Jim's a nigger, and wouldn't\r\nunderstand the reasons for it, and how it's the custom in Europe; so\r\nwe'll let it go. But there's one thing--he can have a rope ladder; we\r\ncan tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough. And we\r\ncan send it to him in a pie; it's mostly done that way. And I've et\r\nworse pies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Tom Sawyer, how you talk,\u201d I says; \u201cJim ain't got no use for a\r\nrope ladder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe _has_ got use for it. How _you_ talk, you better say; you don't\r\nknow nothing about it. He's _got_ to have a rope ladder; they all do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat in the nation can he _do_ with it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Do_ with it? He can hide it in his bed, can't he?\u201d That's what they\r\nall do; and _he's_ got to, too. Huck, you don't ever seem to want to do\r\nanything that's regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the\r\ntime. S'pose he _don't_ do nothing with it? ain't it there in his bed,\r\nfor a clew, after he's gone? and don't you reckon they'll want clews?\r\nOf course they will. And you wouldn't leave them any? That would be a\r\n_pretty_ howdy-do, _wouldn't_ it! I never heard of such a thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I says, \u201cif it's in the regulations, and he's got to have\r\nit, all right, let him have it; because I don't wish to go back on no\r\nregulations; but there's one thing, Tom Sawyer--if we go to tearing up\r\nour sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we're going to get into trouble\r\nwith Aunt Sally, just as sure as you're born. Now, the way I look at\r\nit, a hickry-bark ladder don't cost nothing, and don't waste nothing,\r\nand is just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick,\r\nas any rag ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain't had no\r\nexperience, and so he don't care what kind of a--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I'd keep\r\nstill--that's what _I'd_ do. Who ever heard of a state prisoner\r\nescaping by a hickry-bark ladder? Why, it's perfectly ridiculous.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you'll take my\r\nadvice, you'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe said that would do. And that gave him another idea, and he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cBorrow a shirt, too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do we want of a shirt, Tom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWant it for Jim to keep a journal on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJournal your granny--_Jim_ can't write.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cS'pose he _can't_ write--he can make marks on the shirt, can't he, if\r\nwe make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron\r\nbarrel-hoop?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better\r\none; and quicker, too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Prisoners_ don't have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull\r\npens out of, you muggins. They _always_ make their pens out of the\r\nhardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or\r\nsomething like that they can get their hands on; and it takes them weeks\r\nand weeks and months and months to file it out, too, because they've got\r\nto do it by rubbing it on the wall. _They_ wouldn't use a goose-quill\r\nif they had it. It ain't regular.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMany makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that's the common sort\r\nand women; the best authorities uses their own blood. Jim can do that;\r\nand when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message\r\nto let the world know where he's captivated, he can write it on the\r\nbottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window. The\r\nIron Mask always done that, and it's a blame' good way, too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJim ain't got no tin plates. They feed him in a pan.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat ain't nothing; we can get him some.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan't nobody _read_ his plates.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat ain't got anything to _do_ with it, Huck Finn. All _he's_ got to\r\ndo is to write on the plate and throw it out. You don't _have_ to be\r\nable to read it. Why, half the time you can't read anything a prisoner\r\nwrites on a tin plate, or anywhere else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, blame it all, it ain't the _prisoner's_ plates.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it's _somebody's_ plates, ain't it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, spos'n it is? What does the _prisoner_ care whose--\u201d\r\n\r\nHe broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing. So we\r\ncleared out for the house.\r\n\r\nAlong during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the\r\nclothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went\r\ndown and got the fox-fire, and put that in too. I called it borrowing,\r\nbecause that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn't\r\nborrowing, it was stealing. He said we was representing prisoners; and\r\nprisoners don't care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody\r\ndon't blame them for it, either. It ain't no crime in a prisoner to\r\nsteal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it's his right; and\r\nso, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to\r\nsteal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves\r\nout of prison with. He said if we warn't prisoners it would be a very\r\ndifferent thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when\r\nhe warn't a prisoner. So we allowed we would steal everything there was\r\nthat come handy. And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that,\r\nwhen I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he\r\nmade me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it\r\nwas for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we\r\n_needed_. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon. But he said I didn't\r\nneed it to get out of prison with; there's where the difference was.\r\nHe said if I'd a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim\r\nto kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right. So I let it go at\r\nthat, though I couldn't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner\r\nif I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like\r\nthat every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon.\r\n\r\nWell, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled\r\ndown to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he\r\ncarried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep\r\nwatch. By and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile\r\nto talk. He says:\r\n\r\n\u201cEverything's all right now except tools; and that's easy fixed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTools?\u201d I says.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTools for what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, to dig with. We ain't a-going to _gnaw_ him out, are we?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAin't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a\r\nnigger out with?\u201d I says.\r\n\r\nHe turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHuck Finn, did you _ever_ hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels,\r\nand all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with?\r\nNow I want to ask you--if you got any reasonableness in you at all--what\r\nkind of a show would _that_ give him to be a hero? Why, they might as\r\nwell lend him the key and done with it. Picks and shovels--why, they\r\nwouldn't furnish 'em to a king.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d I says, \u201cif we don't want the picks and shovels, what do\r\nwe want?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA couple of case-knives.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cConfound it, it's foolish, Tom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt don't make no difference how foolish it is, it's the _right_ way--and\r\nit's the regular way. And there ain't no _other_ way, that ever I heard\r\nof, and I've read all the books that gives any information about these\r\nthings. They always dig out with a case-knife--and not through dirt, mind\r\nyou; generly it's through solid rock. And it takes them weeks and weeks\r\nand weeks, and for ever and ever. Why, look at one of them prisoners in\r\nthe bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that\r\ndug himself out that way; how long was _he_ at it, you reckon?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, guess.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't know. A month and a half.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Thirty-seven year_--and he come out in China. _That's_ the kind. I\r\nwish the bottom of _this_ fortress was solid rock.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Jim_ don't know nobody in China.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat's _that_ got to do with it? Neither did that other fellow. But\r\nyou're always a-wandering off on a side issue. Why can't you stick to\r\nthe main point?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right--I don't care where he comes out, so he _comes_ out; and Jim\r\ndon't, either, I reckon. But there's one thing, anyway--Jim's too old to\r\nbe dug out with a case-knife. He won't last.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes he will _last_, too. You don't reckon it's going to take\r\nthirty-seven years to dig out through a _dirt_ foundation, do you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long will it take, Tom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we can't resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn't\r\ntake very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans.\r\nHe'll hear Jim ain't from there. Then his next move will be to\r\nadvertise Jim, or something like that. So we can't resk being as long\r\ndigging him out as we ought to. By rights I reckon we ought to be\r\na couple of years; but we can't. Things being so uncertain, what I\r\nrecommend is this: that we really dig right in, as quick as we can;\r\nand after that, we can _let on_, to ourselves, that we was at it\r\nthirty-seven years. Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the\r\nfirst time there's an alarm. Yes, I reckon that 'll be the best way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, there's _sense_ in that,\u201d I says.  \u201cLetting on don't cost nothing;\r\nletting on ain't no trouble; and if it's any object, I don't mind\r\nletting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year. It wouldn't strain\r\nme none, after I got my hand in. So I'll mosey along now, and smouch a\r\ncouple of case-knives.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSmouch three,\u201d he says; \u201cwe want one to make a saw out of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, if it ain't unregular and irreligious to sejest it,\u201d I says,\r\n\u201cthere's an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the\r\nweather-boarding behind the smoke-house.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt ain't no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck. Run along and\r\nsmouch the knives--three of them.\u201d So I done it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the\r\nlightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our\r\npile of fox-fire, and went to work. We cleared everything out of the\r\nway, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log. Tom\r\nsaid he was right behind Jim's bed now, and we'd dig in under it, and\r\nwhen we got through there couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there\r\nwas any hole there, because Jim's counter-pin hung down most to the\r\nground, and you'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole.\r\nSo we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then\r\nwe was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn't see\r\nwe'd done anything hardly. At last I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cThis ain't no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job,\r\nTom Sawyer.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe never said nothing. But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped\r\ndigging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking.\r\nThen he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt ain't no use, Huck, it ain't a-going to work. If we was prisoners\r\nit would, because then we'd have as many years as we wanted, and no\r\nhurry; and we wouldn't get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while\r\nthey was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn't get blistered, and\r\nwe could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right,\r\nand the way it ought to be done. But _we_ can't fool along; we got to\r\nrush; we ain't got no time to spare. If we was to put in another\r\nnight this way we'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get\r\nwell--couldn't touch a case-knife with them sooner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, what we going to do, Tom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI'll tell you. It ain't right, and it ain't moral, and I wouldn't like\r\nit to get out; but there ain't only just the one way: we got to dig him\r\nout with the picks, and _let on_ it's case-knives.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Now_ you're _talking_!\u201d I says; \u201cyour head gets leveler and leveler\r\nall the time, Tom Sawyer,\u201d I says.  \u201cPicks is the thing, moral or no\r\nmoral; and as for me, I don't care shucks for the morality of it, nohow.\r\nWhen I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school\r\nbook, I ain't no ways particular how it's done so it's done. What I\r\nwant is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my\r\nSunday-school book; and if a pick's the handiest thing, that's the thing\r\nI'm a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school\r\nbook out with; and I don't give a dead rat what the authorities thinks\r\nabout it nuther.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cthere's excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like\r\nthis; if it warn't so, I wouldn't approve of it, nor I wouldn't stand by\r\nand see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is wrong,\r\nand a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and\r\nknows better. It might answer for _you_ to dig Jim out with a pick,\r\n_without_ any letting on, because you don't know no better; but it\r\nwouldn't for me, because I do know better. Gimme a case-knife.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe had his own by him, but I handed him mine. He flung it down, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\u201cGimme a _case-knife_.\u201d\r\n\r\nI didn't know just what to do--but then I thought. I scratched around\r\namongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took\r\nit and went to work, and never said a word.\r\n\r\nHe was always just that particular. Full of principle.\r\n\r\nSo then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about,\r\nand made the fur fly. We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as\r\nlong as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for\r\nit. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing\r\nhis level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn't come it, his\r\nhands was so sore. At last he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt ain't no use, it can't be done. What you reckon I better do? Can't\r\nyou think of no way?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I says, \u201cbut I reckon it ain't regular. Come up the stairs, and\r\nlet on it's a lightning-rod.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo he done it.\r\n\r\nNext day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,\r\nfor to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I\r\nhung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin\r\nplates. Tom says it wasn't enough; but I said nobody wouldn't ever see\r\nthe plates that Jim throwed out, because they'd fall in the dog-fennel\r\nand jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back and\r\nhe could use them over again. So Tom was satisfied. Then he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTake them in through the hole,\u201d I says, \u201cwhen we get it done.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard\r\nof such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. By and by he\r\nsaid he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn't no need to\r\ndecide on any of them yet. Said we'd got to post Jim first.\r\n\r\nThat night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took\r\none of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard\r\nJim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him. Then we\r\nwhirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half\r\nthe job was done. We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and\r\npawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile,\r\nand found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle\r\nand gradual. He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us\r\nhoney, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us\r\nhunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away,\r\nand clearing out without losing any time. But Tom he showed him how\r\nunregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans,\r\nand how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and\r\nnot to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_.\r\nSo Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old\r\ntimes awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told\r\nhim Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt\r\nSally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and\r\nboth of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:\r\n\r\n\u201c_Now_ I know how to fix it. We'll send you some things by them.\u201d\r\n\r\nI said, \u201cDon't do nothing of the kind; it's one of the most jackass\r\nideas I ever struck;\u201d but he never paid no attention to me; went right\r\non. It was his way when he'd got his plans set.\r\n\r\nSo he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other\r\nlarge things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the\r\nlookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and\r\nwe would put small things in uncle's coat-pockets and he must steal them\r\nout; and we would tie things to aunt's apron-strings or put them in her\r\napron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and\r\nwhat they was for. And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with\r\nhis blood, and all that. He told him everything. Jim he couldn't see\r\nno sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed\r\nbetter than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just\r\nas Tom said.\r\n\r\nJim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good\r\nsociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to\r\nbed, with hands that looked like they'd been chawed. Tom was in high\r\nspirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the\r\nmost intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would\r\nkeep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to\r\nget out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the\r\nmore he got used to it. He said that in that way it could be strung out\r\nto as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record. And he\r\nsaid it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass\r\ncandlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in\r\nhis pocket. Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat's\r\nnotice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a\r\ncorn-pone that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see how\r\nit would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most\r\nmashed all his teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could a worked\r\nbetter. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only\r\njust a piece of rock or something like that that's always getting into\r\nbread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he\r\njabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.\r\n\r\nAnd whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a\r\ncouple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim's bed; and they kept on\r\npiling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn't hardly room\r\nin there to get your breath. By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to\r\ndoor! The nigger Nat he only just hollered \u201cWitches\u201d once, and keeled\r\nover on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was\r\ndying. Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim's meat,\r\nand the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back\r\nagain and shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other door too.\r\nThen he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and\r\nasking him if he'd been imagining he saw something again. He raised up,\r\nand blinked his eyes around, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cMars Sid, you'll say I's a fool, but if I didn't b'lieve I see most a\r\nmillion dogs, er devils, er some'n, I wisht I may die right heah in dese\r\ntracks. I did, mos' sholy. Mars Sid, I _felt_ um--I _felt_ um, sah; dey\r\nwas all over me. Dad fetch it, I jis' wisht I could git my han's on one\r\ner dem witches jis' wunst--on'y jis' wunst--it's all I'd ast. But mos'ly\r\nI wisht dey'd lemme 'lone, I does.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I tell you what I think. What makes them come here just at this\r\nrunaway nigger's breakfast-time? It's because they're hungry; that's\r\nthe reason. You make them a witch pie; that's the thing for _you_ to\r\ndo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut my lan', Mars Sid, how's I gwyne to make 'm a witch pie? I doan'\r\nknow how to make it. I hain't ever hearn er sich a thing b'fo'.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, I'll have to make it myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you do it, honey?--will you? I'll wusshup de groun' und' yo' foot,\r\nI will!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, I'll do it, seeing it's you, and you've been good to us and\r\nshowed us the runaway nigger. But you got to be mighty careful. When\r\nwe come around, you turn your back; and then whatever we've put in the\r\npan, don't you let on you see it at all. And don't you look when Jim\r\nunloads the pan--something might happen, I don't know what. And above\r\nall, don't you _handle_ the witch-things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Hannel 'M_, Mars Sid? What _is_ you a-talkin' 'bout? I wouldn'\r\nlay de weight er my finger on um, not f'r ten hund'd thous'n billion\r\ndollars, I wouldn't.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was all fixed. So then we went away and went to the rubbage-pile\r\nin the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags, and pieces\r\nof bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and scratched\r\naround and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as well as\r\nwe could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole it full\r\nof flour and started for breakfast, and found a couple of shingle-nails\r\nthat Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and\r\nsorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in Aunt\r\nSally's apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t'other we stuck\r\nin the band of Uncle Silas's hat, which was on the bureau, because we\r\nheard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger's\r\nhouse this morning, and then went to breakfast, and Tom dropped the\r\npewter spoon in Uncle Silas's coat-pocket, and Aunt Sally wasn't come\r\nyet, so we had to wait a little while.\r\n\r\nAnd when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn't hardly\r\nwait for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one\r\nhand and cracking the handiest child's head with her thimble with the\r\nother, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI've hunted high and I've hunted low, and it does beat all what _has_\r\nbecome of your other shirt.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard\r\npiece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the\r\nroad with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of the\r\nchildren in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let a cry\r\nout of him the size of a warwhoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue around\r\nthe gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for\r\nabout a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold out\r\nfor half price if there was a bidder. But after that we was all right\r\nagain--it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold.\r\nUncle Silas he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's most uncommon curious, I can't understand it. I know perfectly\r\nwell I took it _off_, because--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause you hain't got but one _on_. Just _listen_ at the man! I know\r\nyou took it off, and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering\r\nmemory, too, because it was on the clo's-line yesterday--I see it there\r\nmyself. But it's gone, that's the long and the short of it, and you'll\r\njust have to change to a red flann'l one till I can get time to make a\r\nnew one. And it 'll be the third I've made in two years. It just keeps\r\na body on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to\r\n_do_ with 'm all is more'n I can make out. A body 'd think you _would_\r\nlearn to take some sort of care of 'em at your time of life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know it, Sally, and I do try all I can. But it oughtn't to be\r\naltogether my fault, because, you know, I don't see them nor have\r\nnothing to do with them except when they're on me; and I don't believe\r\nI've ever lost one of them _off_ of me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it ain't _your_ fault if you haven't, Silas; you'd a done it\r\nif you could, I reckon. And the shirt ain't all that's gone, nuther.\r\nTher's a spoon gone; and _that_ ain't all. There was ten, and now\r\nther's only nine. The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never\r\ntook the spoon, _that's_ certain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what else is gone, Sally?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTher's six _candles_ gone--that's what. The rats could a got the\r\ncandles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don't walk off with the\r\nwhole place, the way you're always going to stop their holes and don't\r\ndo it; and if they warn't fools they'd sleep in your hair, Silas--_you'd_\r\nnever find it out; but you can't lay the _spoon_ on the rats, and that I\r\nknow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Sally, I'm in fault, and I acknowledge it; I've been remiss; but\r\nI won't let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I wouldn't hurry; next year 'll do. Matilda Angelina Araminta\r\n_Phelps!_\u201d\r\n\r\nWhack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the\r\nsugar-bowl without fooling around any. Just then the nigger woman steps\r\non to the passage, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cMissus, dey's a sheet gone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA _sheet_ gone! Well, for the land's sake!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI'll stop up them holes to-day,\u201d says Uncle Silas, looking sorrowful.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, _do_ shet up!--s'pose the rats took the _sheet_? _where's_ it gone,\r\nLize?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cClah to goodness I hain't no notion, Miss' Sally. She wuz on de\r\nclo'sline yistiddy, but she done gone: she ain' dah no mo' now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reckon the world _is_ coming to an end. I _never_ see the beat of it\r\nin all my born days. A shirt, and a sheet, and a spoon, and six can--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMissus,\u201d comes a young yaller wench, \u201cdey's a brass cannelstick\r\nmiss'n.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCler out from here, you hussy, er I'll take a skillet to ye!\u201d\r\n\r\nWell, she was just a-biling. I begun to lay for a chance; I reckoned\r\nI would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated. She\r\nkept a-raging right along, running her insurrection all by herself, and\r\neverybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking\r\nkind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket. She stopped,\r\nwith her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I was in\r\nJeruslem or somewheres. But not long, because she says:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's _just_ as I expected. So you had it in your pocket all the time;\r\nand like as not you've got the other things there, too. How'd it get\r\nthere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reely don't know, Sally,\u201d he says, kind of apologizing, \u201cor you know\r\nI would tell. I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before\r\nbreakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to put\r\nmy Testament in, and it must be so, because my Testament ain't in; but\r\nI'll go and see; and if the Testament is where I had it, I'll know I\r\ndidn't put it in, and that will show that I laid the Testament down and\r\ntook up the spoon, and--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, for the land's sake! Give a body a rest! Go 'long now, the whole\r\nkit and biling of ye; and don't come nigh me again till I've got back my\r\npeace of mind.\u201d\r\n\r\n_I'd_ a heard her if she'd a said it to herself, let alone speaking it\r\nout; and I'd a got up and obeyed her if I'd a been dead. As we was\r\npassing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat, and the\r\nshingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just merely picked it up and\r\nlaid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and went out. Tom\r\nsee him do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it ain't no use to send things by _him_ no more, he ain't\r\nreliable.\u201d Then he says: \u201cBut he done us a good turn with the spoon,\r\nanyway, without knowing it, and so we'll go and do him one without _him_\r\nknowing it--stop up his rat-holes.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a whole\r\nhour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape. Then we heard\r\nsteps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here comes\r\nthe old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t'other,\r\nlooking as absent-minded as year before last. He went a mooning around,\r\nfirst to one rat-hole and then another, till he'd been to them all.\r\nThen he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his candle\r\nand thinking. Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, for the life of me I can't remember when I done it. I could\r\nshow her now that I warn't to blame on account of the rats. But never\r\nmind--let it go. I reckon it wouldn't do no good.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left. He was a\r\nmighty nice old man. And always is.\r\n\r\nTom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said\r\nwe'd got to have it; so he took a think. When he had ciphered it out\r\nhe told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the\r\nspoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to\r\ncounting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of\r\nthem up my sleeve, and Tom says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoons _yet_.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe says:\r\n\r\n\u201cGo 'long to your play, and don't bother me. I know better, I counted\r\n'm myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and I can't make but nine.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count--anybody\r\nwould.\r\n\r\n\u201cI declare to gracious ther' _ain't_ but nine!\u201d she says.  \u201cWhy, what in\r\nthe world--plague _take_ the things, I'll count 'm again.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\u201cHang the troublesome rubbage, ther's _ten_ now!\u201d and she looked huffy\r\nand bothered both. But Tom says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Aunty, I don't think there's ten.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou numskull, didn't you see me _count 'm?_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know, but--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I'll count 'm _again_.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time.\r\nWell, she _was_ in a tearing way--just a-trembling all over, she was so\r\nmad. But she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd start\r\nto count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they\r\ncome out right, and three times they come out wrong. Then she grabbed\r\nup the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat\r\ngalley-west; and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace, and if\r\nwe come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin\r\nus. So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst\r\nshe was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along\r\nwith her shingle nail, before noon. We was very well satisfied with\r\nthis business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,\r\nbecause he said _now_ she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike\r\nagain to save her life; and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if\r\nshe _did_; and said that after she'd about counted her head off for the\r\nnext three days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody\r\nthat wanted her to ever count them any more.\r\n\r\nSo we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of\r\nher closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a\r\ncouple of days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more,\r\nand she didn't _care_, and warn't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her\r\nsoul out about it, and wouldn't count them again not to save her life;\r\nshe druther die first.\r\n\r\nSo we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon\r\nand the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up\r\ncounting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't no consequence, it would\r\nblow over by and by.\r\n\r\nBut that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. We\r\nfixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it\r\ndone at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we\r\nhad to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and\r\nwe got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with\r\nthe smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust, and we\r\ncouldn't prop it up right, and she would always cave in. But of course\r\nwe thought of the right way at last--which was to cook the ladder, too,\r\nin the pie. So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore\r\nup the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long\r\nbefore daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person\r\nwith. We let on it took nine months to make it.\r\n\r\nAnd in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn't go\r\ninto the pie. Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope\r\nenough for forty pies if we'd a wanted them, and plenty left over\r\nfor soup, or sausage, or anything you choose. We could a had a whole\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nBut we didn't need it. All we needed was just enough for the pie, and\r\nso we throwed the rest away. We didn't cook none of the pies in the\r\nwash-pan--afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble\r\nbrass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it belonged\r\nto one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from\r\nEngland with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early\r\nships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things\r\nthat was valuable, not on account of being any account, because they\r\nwarn't, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked\r\nher out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first\r\npies, because we didn't know how, but she come up smiling on the last\r\none. We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and\r\nloaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the\r\nlid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long\r\nhandle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a\r\npie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would\r\nwant to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope\r\nladder wouldn't cramp him down to business I don't know nothing what I'm\r\ntalking about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next\r\ntime, too.\r\n\r\nNat didn't look when we put the witch pie in Jim's pan; and we put the\r\nthree tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jim\r\ngot everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he busted\r\ninto the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick,\r\nand scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the\r\nwindow-hole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaking them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim\r\nallowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all. That's the\r\none which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. But he had to have\r\nit; Tom said he'd _got_ to; there warn't no case of a state prisoner not\r\nscrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at Lady Jane Grey,\u201d he says; \u201clook at Gilford Dudley; look at old\r\nNorthumberland! Why, Huck, s'pose it _is_ considerble trouble?--what\r\nyou going to do?--how you going to get around it? Jim's _got_ to do his\r\ninscription and coat of arms. They all do.\u201d\r\n\r\nJim says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Mars Tom, I hain't got no coat o' arm; I hain't got nuffn but dish\r\nyer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you don't understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I says, \u201cJim's right, anyway, when he says he ain't got no coat\r\nof arms, because he hain't.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reckon I knowed that,\u201d Tom says, \u201cbut you bet he'll have one before\r\nhe goes out of this--because he's going out _right_, and there ain't\r\ngoing to be no flaws in his record.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim\r\na-making his'n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon,\r\nTom set to work to think out the coat of arms. By and by he said he'd\r\nstruck so many good ones he didn't hardly know which to take, but there\r\nwas one which he reckoned he'd decide on. He says:\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the scutcheon we'll have a bend _or_ in the dexter base, a saltire\r\n_murrey_ in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under\r\nhis foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron _vert_ in a\r\nchief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field _azure_, with the\r\nnombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger,\r\n_sable_, with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a\r\ncouple of gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto, _Maggiore\r\nFretta, Minore Otto._ Got it out of a book--means the more haste the\r\nless speed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGeewhillikins,\u201d I says, \u201cbut what does the rest of it mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe ain't got no time to bother over that,\u201d he says; \u201cwe got to dig in\r\nlike all git-out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, anyway,\u201d I says, \u201cwhat's _some_ of it? What's a fess?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA fess--a fess is--_you_ don't need to know what a fess is. I'll show\r\nhim how to make it when he gets to it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShucks, Tom,\u201d I says, \u201cI think you might tell a person. What's a bar\r\nsinister?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I don't know. But he's got to have it. All the nobility does.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat was just his way. If it didn't suit him to explain a thing to you,\r\nhe wouldn't do it. You might pump at him a week, it wouldn't make no\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nHe'd got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to\r\nfinish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a\r\nmournful inscription--said Jim got to have one, like they all done. He\r\nmade up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:\r\n\r\n1. Here a captive heart busted. 2. Here a poor prisoner, forsook by\r\nthe world and friends, fretted his sorrowful life. 3. Here a lonely\r\nheart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-seven\r\nyears of solitary captivity. 4. Here, homeless and friendless, after\r\nthirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger,\r\nnatural son of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nTom's voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down.\r\nWhen he got done he couldn't no way make up his mind which one for Jim\r\nto scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowed\r\nhe would let him scrabble them all on. Jim said it would take him a\r\nyear to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and he\r\ndidn't know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said he would block\r\nthem out for him, and then he wouldn't have nothing to do but just\r\nfollow the lines. Then pretty soon he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cCome to think, the logs ain't a-going to do; they don't have log walls\r\nin a dungeon: we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock. We'll fetch\r\na rock.\u201d\r\n\r\nJim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him\r\nsuch a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn't ever get out.\r\nBut Tom said he would let me help him do it. Then he took a look to\r\nsee how me and Jim was getting along with the pens. It was most pesky\r\ntedious hard work and slow, and didn't give my hands no show to get\r\nwell of the sores, and we didn't seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\u201cI know how to fix it. We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and\r\nmournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock.\r\nThere's a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we'll smouch it,\r\nand carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it,\r\ntoo.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt warn't no slouch of an idea; and it warn't no slouch of a grindstone\r\nnuther; but we allowed we'd tackle it. It warn't quite midnight yet,\r\nso we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work. We smouched the\r\ngrindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nation tough\r\njob. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn't keep her from falling\r\nover, and she come mighty near mashing us every time. Tom said she was\r\ngoing to get one of us, sure, before we got through. We got her half\r\nway; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat. We\r\nsee it warn't no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. So he raised up his\r\nbed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round\r\nhis neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jim\r\nand me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; and\r\nTom superintended. He could out-superintend any boy I ever see. He\r\nknowed how to do everything.\r\n\r\nOur hole was pretty big, but it warn't big enough to get the grindstone\r\nthrough; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough. Then Tom\r\nmarked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work on them,\r\nwith the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the\r\nlean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his candle\r\nquit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under\r\nhis straw tick and sleep on it. Then we helped him fix his chain back\r\non the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves. But Tom thought of\r\nsomething, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou got any spiders in here, Jim?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sah, thanks to goodness I hain't, Mars Tom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, we'll get you some.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut bless you, honey, I doan' _want_ none. I's afeard un um. I jis'\r\n's soon have rattlesnakes aroun'.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom thought a minute or two, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's a good idea. And I reckon it's been done. It _must_ a been done;\r\nit stands to reason. Yes, it's a prime good idea. Where could you keep\r\nit?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKeep what, Mars Tom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, a rattlesnake.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDe goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom! Why, if dey was a rattlesnake to\r\ncome in heah I'd take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid\r\nmy head.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Jim, you wouldn't be afraid of it after a little. You could tame\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Tame_ it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes--easy enough. Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting,\r\nand they wouldn't _think_ of hurting a person that pets them. Any book\r\nwill tell you that. You try--that's all I ask; just try for two or three\r\ndays. Why, you can get him so, in a little while, that he'll love you;\r\nand sleep with you; and won't stay away from you a minute; and will let\r\nyou wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Please_, Mars Tom--_doan_' talk so! I can't _stan_' it! He'd _let_\r\nme shove his head in my mouf--fer a favor, hain't it? I lay he'd wait a\r\npow'ful long time 'fo' I _ast_ him. En mo' en dat, I doan' _want_ him\r\nto sleep wid me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJim, don't act so foolish. A prisoner's _got_ to have some kind of a\r\ndumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain't ever been tried, why, there's more\r\nglory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other\r\nway you could ever think of to save your life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Mars Tom, I doan' _want_ no sich glory. Snake take 'n bite\r\nJim's chin off, den _whah_ is de glory? No, sah, I doan' want no sich\r\ndoin's.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBlame it, can't you _try_? I only _want_ you to try--you needn't keep\r\nit up if it don't work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut de trouble all _done_ ef de snake bite me while I's a tryin' him.\r\nMars Tom, I's willin' to tackle mos' anything 'at ain't onreasonable,\r\nbut ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I's\r\ngwyne to _leave_, dat's _shore_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, let it go, let it go, if you're so bull-headed about it.\r\nWe can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie some buttons on\r\ntheir tails, and let on they're rattlesnakes, and I reckon that 'll have\r\nto do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI k'n stan' _dem_, Mars Tom, but blame' 'f I couldn' get along widout\r\num, I tell you dat. I never knowed b'fo' 't was so much bother and\r\ntrouble to be a prisoner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it _always_ is when it's done right. You got any rats around\r\nhere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sah, I hain't seed none.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we'll get you some rats.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Mars Tom, I doan' _want_ no rats. Dey's de dadblamedest creturs\r\nto 'sturb a body, en rustle roun' over 'im, en bite his feet, when he's\r\ntryin' to sleep, I ever see. No, sah, gimme g'yarter-snakes, 'f I's\r\ngot to have 'm, but doan' gimme no rats; I hain' got no use f'r um,\r\nskasely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, Jim, you _got_ to have 'em--they all do. So don't make no more\r\nfuss about it. Prisoners ain't ever without rats. There ain't no\r\ninstance of it. And they train them, and pet them, and learn them\r\ntricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies. But you got to play\r\nmusic to them. You got anything to play music on?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI ain' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o' paper, en a juice-harp;\r\nbut I reck'n dey wouldn' take no stock in a juice-harp.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes they would_they_ don't care what kind of music 'tis. A\r\njews-harp's plenty good enough for a rat. All animals like music--in a\r\nprison they dote on it. Specially, painful music; and you can't get no\r\nother kind out of a jews-harp. It always interests them; they come out\r\nto see what's the matter with you. Yes, you're all right; you're fixed\r\nvery well. You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep,\r\nand early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play 'The Last Link\r\nis Broken'--that's the thing that 'll scoop a rat quicker 'n anything\r\nelse; and when you've played about two minutes you'll see all the rats,\r\nand the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you,\r\nand come. And they'll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good\r\ntime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, _dey_ will, I reck'n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is _Jim_\r\nhavin'? Blest if I kin see de pint. But I'll do it ef I got to. I\r\nreck'n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in de\r\nhouse.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn't nothing else; and\r\npretty soon he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, there's one thing I forgot. Could you raise a flower here, do you\r\nreckon?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it's tolable dark in heah,\r\nen I ain' got no use f'r no flower, nohow, en she'd be a pow'ful sight\r\no' trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you try it, anyway. Some other prisoners has done it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne er dem big cat-tail-lookin' mullen-stalks would grow in heah, Mars\r\nTom, I reck'n, but she wouldn't be wuth half de trouble she'd coss.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon't you believe it. We'll fetch you a little one and you plant it in\r\nthe corner over there, and raise it. And don't call it mullen, call it\r\nPitchiola--that's its right name when it's in a prison. And you want to\r\nwater it with your tears.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don't _want_ spring water; you want to water it with your tears.\r\nIt's the way they always do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid\r\nspring water whiles another man's a _start'n_ one wid tears.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat ain't the idea. You _got_ to do it with tears.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe'll die on my han's, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan' skasely\r\never cry.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo Tom was stumped. But he studied it over, and then said Jim would\r\nhave to worry along the best he could with an onion. He promised\r\nhe would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim's\r\ncoffee-pot, in the morning. Jim said he would \u201cjis' 's soon have\r\ntobacker in his coffee;\u201d and found so much fault with it, and with the\r\nwork and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and\r\npetting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of\r\nall the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals,\r\nand things, which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to\r\nbe a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all\r\npatience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier\r\nchances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for\r\nhimself, and yet he didn't know enough to appreciate them, and they was\r\njust about wasted on him. So Jim he was sorry, and said he wouldn't\r\nbehave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and\r\nfetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour\r\nwe had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put\r\nit in a safe place under Aunt Sally's bed. But while we was gone for\r\nspiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found\r\nit there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out,\r\nand they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was\r\na-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what\r\nthey could to keep off the dull times for her. So she took and dusted\r\nus both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching\r\nanother fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn't\r\nthe likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock.\r\nI never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.\r\n\r\nWe got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and\r\ncaterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet's\r\nnest, but we didn't. The family was at home. We didn't give it right\r\nup, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we'd\r\ntire them out or they'd got to tire us out, and they done it. Then we\r\ngot allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right\r\nagain, but couldn't set down convenient. And so we went for the snakes,\r\nand grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in\r\na bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and\r\na rattling good honest day's work: and hungry?--oh, no, I reckon not!\r\nAnd there warn't a blessed snake up there when we went back--we didn't\r\nhalf tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left. But it didn't\r\nmatter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres. So\r\nwe judged we could get some of them again. No, there warn't no real\r\nscarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell. You'd see\r\nthem dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they\r\ngenerly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most\r\nof the time where you didn't want them. Well, they was handsome and\r\nstriped, and there warn't no harm in a million of them; but that never\r\nmade no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what\r\nthey might, and she couldn't stand them no way you could fix it; and\r\nevery time one of them flopped down on her, it didn't make no difference\r\nwhat she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out. I\r\nnever see such a woman. And you could hear her whoop to Jericho. You\r\ncouldn't get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs. And if\r\nshe turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a\r\nhowl that you would think the house was afire. She disturbed the old\r\nman so that he said he could most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes\r\ncreated. Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the\r\nhouse for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn't over it yet; she warn't\r\nnear over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could\r\ntouch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump\r\nright out of her stockings. It was very curious. But Tom said all\r\nwomen was just so. He said they was made that way for some reason or\r\nother.\r\n\r\nWe got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she\r\nallowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would do if we ever\r\nloaded up the place again with them. I didn't mind the lickings,\r\nbecause they didn't amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we\r\nhad to lay in another lot. But we got them laid in, and all the other\r\nthings; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when they'd\r\nall swarm out for music and go for him. Jim didn't like the spiders,\r\nand the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it\r\nmighty warm for him. And he said that between the rats and the snakes\r\nand the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him, skasely; and\r\nwhen there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was\r\nalways lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept at one time, but\r\ntook turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and\r\nwhen the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one\r\ngang under him, in his way, and t'other gang having a circus over him,\r\nand if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at\r\nhim as he crossed over. He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't\r\never be a prisoner again, not for a salary.\r\n\r\nWell, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.\r\nThe shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he\r\nwould get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh;\r\nthe pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the\r\ngrindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust,\r\nand it give us a most amazing stomach-ache. We reckoned we was all\r\ngoing to die, but didn't. It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever\r\nsee; and Tom said the same.\r\n\r\nBut as I was saying, we'd got all the work done now, at last; and we was\r\nall pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim. The old man had wrote\r\na couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their\r\nrunaway nigger, but hadn't got no answer, because there warn't no such\r\nplantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and\r\nNew Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me\r\nthe cold shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose. So Tom said, now\r\nfor the nonnamous letters.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat's them?\u201d I says.\r\n\r\n\u201cWarnings to the people that something is up. Sometimes it's done one\r\nway, sometimes another. But there's always somebody spying around that\r\ngives notice to the governor of the castle. When Louis XVI. was going\r\nto light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it. It's a very good\r\nway, and so is the nonnamous letters. We'll use them both. And it's\r\nusual for the prisoner's mother to change clothes with him, and she\r\nstays in, and he slides out in her clothes. We'll do that, too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut looky here, Tom, what do we want to _warn_ anybody for that\r\nsomething's up? Let them find it out for themselves--it's their\r\nlookout.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I know; but you can't depend on them. It's the way they've acted\r\nfrom the very start--left us to do _everything_. They're so confiding\r\nand mullet-headed they don't take notice of nothing at all. So if we\r\ndon't _give_ them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to interfere\r\nwith us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go\r\noff perfectly flat; won't amount to nothing--won't be nothing _to_ it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, as for me, Tom, that's the way I'd like.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShucks!\u201d he says, and looked disgusted. So I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I ain't going to make no complaint. Any way that suits you suits\r\nme. What you going to do about the servant-girl?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou'll be her. You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook that\r\nyaller girl's frock.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Tom, that 'll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she\r\nprob'bly hain't got any but that one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know; but you don't want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the\r\nnonnamous letter and shove it under the front door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, then, I'll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my\r\nown togs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou wouldn't look like a servant-girl _then_, would you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but there won't be nobody to see what I look like, _anyway_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat ain't got nothing to do with it. The thing for us to do is just\r\nto do our _duty_, and not worry about whether anybody _sees_ us do it or\r\nnot. Hain't you got no principle at all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, I ain't saying nothing; I'm the servant-girl. Who's Jim's\r\nmother?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm his mother. I'll hook a gown from Aunt Sally.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, you'll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot much. I'll stuff Jim's clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed\r\nto represent his mother in disguise, and Jim 'll take the nigger woman's\r\ngown off of me and wear it, and we'll all evade together. When a\r\nprisoner of style escapes it's called an evasion. It's always called\r\nso when a king escapes, f'rinstance. And the same with a king's son;\r\nit don't make no difference whether he's a natural one or an unnatural\r\none.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench's\r\nfrock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the\r\nway Tom told me to. It said:\r\n\r\nBeware. Trouble is brewing. Keep a sharp lookout. _Unknown_ _Friend_.\r\n\r\nNext night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and\r\ncrossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on\r\nthe back door. I never see a family in such a sweat. They couldn't a\r\nbeen worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them\r\nbehind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air. If\r\na door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said \u201couch!\u201d if anything fell,\r\nshe jumped and said \u201couch!\u201d if you happened to touch her, when she\r\nwarn't noticing, she done the same; she couldn't face noway and be\r\nsatisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every\r\ntime--so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying \u201couch,\u201d and\r\nbefore she'd got two-thirds around she'd whirl back again, and say it\r\nagain; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn't set up. So the\r\nthing was working very well, Tom said; he said he never see a thing work\r\nmore satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.\r\n\r\nSo he said, now for the grand bulge! So the very next morning at the\r\nstreak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we\r\nbetter do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going\r\nto have a nigger on watch at both doors all night. Tom he went down the\r\nlightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep,\r\nand he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back. This letter\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\nDon't betray me, I wish to be your friend. There is a desprate gang of\r\ncutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway\r\nnigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you will\r\nstay in the house and not bother them. I am one of the gang, but have\r\ngot religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again, and\r\nwill betray the helish design. They will sneak down from northards,\r\nalong the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the\r\nnigger's cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn\r\nif I see any danger; but stead of that I will _baa_ like a sheep soon as\r\nthey get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his\r\nchains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your\r\nleasure. Don't do anything but just the way I am telling you, if you do\r\nthey will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish\r\nany reward but to know I have done the right thing. _Unknown Friend._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went\r\nover the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a\r\nlook at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper,\r\nand found them in such a sweat and worry they didn't know which end they\r\nwas standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done\r\nsupper, and wouldn't tell us what the trouble was, and never let on a\r\nword about the new letter, but didn't need to, because we knowed as much\r\nabout it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and her\r\nback was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good\r\nlunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about\r\nhalf-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally's dress that he stole and\r\nwas going to start with the lunch, but says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere's the butter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI laid out a hunk of it,\u201d I says, \u201con a piece of a corn-pone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you _left_ it laid out, then--it ain't here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe can get along without it,\u201d I says.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe can get along _with_ it, too,\u201d he says; \u201cjust you slide down cellar\r\nand fetch it. And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come\r\nalong. I'll go and stuff the straw into Jim's clothes to represent his\r\nmother in disguise, and be ready to _baa_ like a sheep and shove soon as\r\nyou get there.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as\r\na person's fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of\r\ncorn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs\r\nvery stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes\r\nAunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped\r\nmy hat on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou been down cellar?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes'm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat you been doing down there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNoth'n.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Noth'n!_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo'm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't know 'm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don't _know_? Don't answer me that way. Tom, I want to know what\r\nyou been _doing_ down there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hain't been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if I\r\nhave.\u201d\r\n\r\nI reckoned she'd let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but I\r\ns'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat\r\nabout every little thing that warn't yard-stick straight; so she says,\r\nvery decided:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come. You\r\nbeen up to something you no business to, and I lay I'll find out what it\r\nis before I'M done with you.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room.\r\nMy, but there was a crowd there! Fifteen farmers, and every one of them\r\nhad a gun. I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down.\r\nThey was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice,\r\nand all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they warn't;\r\nbut I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their hats,\r\nand putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their\r\nseats, and fumbling with their buttons. I warn't easy myself, but I\r\ndidn't take my hat off, all the same.\r\n\r\nI did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if\r\nshe wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we'd overdone this\r\nthing, and what a thundering hornet's-nest we'd got ourselves into, so\r\nwe could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with Jim before\r\nthese rips got out of patience and come for us.\r\n\r\nAt last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I _couldn't_ answer\r\nthem straight, I didn't know which end of me was up; because these men\r\nwas in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and\r\nlay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn't but a few minutes to\r\nmidnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the\r\nsheep-signal; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and\r\nme a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was\r\nthat scared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butter\r\nbeginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears; and pretty\r\nsoon, when one of them says, \u201cI'M for going and getting in the cabin\r\n_first_ and right _now_, and catching them when they come,\u201d I most\r\ndropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead, and\r\nAunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cFor the land's sake, what _is_ the matter with the child? He's got the\r\nbrain-fever as shore as you're born, and they're oozing out!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comes\r\nthe bread and what was left of the butter, and she grabbed me, and\r\nhugged me, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I am it\r\nain't no worse; for luck's against us, and it never rains but it pours,\r\nand when I see that truck I thought we'd lost you, for I knowed by\r\nthe color and all it was just like your brains would be if--Dear,\r\ndear, whyd'nt you _tell_ me that was what you'd been down there for, I\r\nwouldn't a cared. Now cler out to bed, and don't lemme see no more of\r\nyou till morning!\u201d\r\n\r\nI was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one,\r\nand shinning through the dark for the lean-to. I couldn't hardly get my\r\nwords out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must\r\njump for it now, and not a minute to lose--the house full of men, yonder,\r\nwith guns!\r\n\r\nHis eyes just blazed; and he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!--is that so? _ain't_ it bully! Why, Huck, if it was to do over\r\nagain, I bet I could fetch two hundred! If we could put it off till--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHurry! _Hurry_!\u201d I says.  \u201cWhere's Jim?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRight at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him.\r\nHe's dressed, and everything's ready. Now we'll slide out and give the\r\nsheep-signal.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them\r\nbegin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:\r\n\r\n\u201cI _told_ you we'd be too soon; they haven't come--the door is locked.\r\nHere, I'll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for 'em in the\r\ndark and kill 'em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece,\r\nand listen if you can hear 'em coming.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, and most trod on\r\nus whilst we was hustling to get under the bed. But we got under all\r\nright, and out through the hole, swift but soft--Jim first, me next,\r\nand Tom last, which was according to Tom's orders. Now we was in the\r\nlean-to, and heard trampings close by outside. So we crept to the door,\r\nand Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn't make\r\nout nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen\r\nfor the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out\r\nfirst, and him last. So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and\r\nlistened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all\r\nthe time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down,\r\nnot breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy\r\ntowards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim\r\nover it; but Tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top\r\nrail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which\r\nsnapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks\r\nand started somebody sings out:\r\n\r\n\u201cWho's that? Answer, or I'll shoot!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved. Then there\r\nwas a rush, and a _Bang, Bang, Bang!_ and the bullets fairly whizzed\r\naround us! We heard them sing out:\r\n\r\n\u201cHere they are! They've broke for the river! After 'em, boys, and turn\r\nloose the dogs!\u201d\r\n\r\nSo here they come, full tilt. We could hear them because they wore\r\nboots and yelled, but we didn't wear no boots and didn't yell. We was\r\nin the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we\r\ndodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind\r\nthem. They'd had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn't scare off the\r\nrobbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they\r\ncome, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we\r\nstopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn't\r\nnobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said\r\nhowdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and\r\nthen we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly\r\nto the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was\r\ntied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the\r\nriver, but didn't make no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we\r\nstruck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and\r\nwe could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the\r\nbank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out. And when\r\nwe stepped on to the raft I says:\r\n\r\n\u201c_Now_, old Jim, you're a free man again, and I bet you won't ever be a\r\nslave no more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEn a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck. It 'uz planned beautiful, en\r\nit 'uz done beautiful; en dey ain't _nobody_ kin git up a plan dat's mo'\r\nmixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because\r\nhe had a bullet in the calf of his leg.\r\n\r\nWhen me and Jim heard that we didn't feel so brash as what we did\r\nbefore. It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him in\r\nthe wigwam and tore up one of the duke's shirts for to bandage him, but\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n\u201cGimme the rags; I can do it myself. Don't stop now; don't fool around\r\nhere, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and set\r\nher loose! Boys, we done it elegant!--'deed we did. I wish _we'd_ a\r\nhad the handling of Louis XVI., there wouldn't a been no 'Son of Saint\r\nLouis, ascend to heaven!' wrote down in _his_ biography; no, sir, we'd\r\na whooped him over the _border_--that's what we'd a done with _him_--and\r\ndone it just as slick as nothing at all, too. Man the sweeps--man the\r\nsweeps!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut me and Jim was consulting--and thinking. And after we'd thought a\r\nminute, I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cSay it, Jim.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck. Ef it wuz _him_ dat 'uz\r\nbein' sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, 'Go on\r\nen save me, nemmine 'bout a doctor f'r to save dis one?' Is dat like\r\nMars Tom Sawyer? Would he say dat? You _bet_ he wouldn't! _well_,\r\nden, is _Jim_ gywne to say it? No, sah--I doan' budge a step out'n dis\r\nplace 'dout a _doctor_, not if it's forty year!\u201d\r\n\r\nI knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he'd say what he did say--so\r\nit was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor.\r\nHe raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and\r\nwouldn't budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose\r\nhimself; but we wouldn't let him. Then he give us a piece of his mind,\r\nbut it didn't do no good.\r\n\r\nSo when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, if you're bound to go, I'll tell you the way to do when you\r\nget to the village. Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and\r\nfast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse\r\nfull of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the\r\nback alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here in the\r\ncanoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and take\r\nhis chalk away from him, and don't give it back to him till you get him\r\nback to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it\r\nagain. It's the way they all do.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he\r\nsee the doctor coming till he was gone again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got\r\nhim up. I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting\r\nyesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about\r\nmidnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and\r\nshot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and\r\nnot say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to\r\ncome home this evening and surprise the folks.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is your folks?\u201d he says.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Phelpses, down yonder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d he says. And after a minute, he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHow'd you say he got shot?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe had a dream,\u201d I says, \u201cand it shot him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSingular dream,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\nSo he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started. But\r\nwhen he sees the canoe he didn't like the look of her--said she was big\r\nenough for one, but didn't look pretty safe for two. I says:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy\r\nenough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat three?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, me and Sid, and--and--and _the guns_; that's what I mean.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\nBut he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head,\r\nand said he reckoned he'd look around for a bigger one. But they was\r\nall locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait\r\ntill he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better\r\ngo down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to. But\r\nI said I didn't; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nI struck an idea pretty soon. I says to myself, spos'n he can't fix\r\nthat leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail, as the saying is?\r\nspos'n it takes him three or four days? What are we going to do?--lay\r\naround there till he lets the cat out of the bag? No, sir; I know what\r\n_I'll_ do. I'll wait, and when he comes back if he says he's got to\r\ngo any more I'll get down there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and tie\r\nhim, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom's done\r\nwith him we'll give him what it's worth, or all we got, and then let him\r\nget ashore.\r\n\r\nSo then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I\r\nwaked up the sun was away up over my head! I shot out and went for the\r\ndoctor's house, but they told me he'd gone away in the night some time\r\nor other, and warn't back yet. Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad\r\nfor Tom, and I'll dig out for the island right off. So away I shoved,\r\nand turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas's\r\nstomach! He says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, _Tom!_ Where you been all this time, you rascal?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hain't been nowheres,\u201d I says, \u201conly just hunting for the runaway\r\nnigger--me and Sid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, where ever did you go?\u201d he says.  \u201cYour aunt's been mighty\r\nuneasy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe needn't,\u201d I says, \u201cbecause we was all right. We followed the men\r\nand the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we\r\nheard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and\r\ncrossed over, but couldn't find nothing of them; so we cruised along\r\nup-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe\r\nand went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we\r\npaddled over here to hear the news, and Sid's at the post-office to see\r\nwhat he can hear, and I'm a-branching out to get something to eat for\r\nus, and then we're going home.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo then we went to the post-office to get \u201cSid\u201d; but just as I\r\nsuspicioned, he warn't there; so the old man he got a letter out of the\r\noffice, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn't come; so the old man\r\nsaid, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done\r\nfooling around--but we would ride. I couldn't get him to let me stay\r\nand wait for Sid; and he said there warn't no use in it, and I must come\r\nalong, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.\r\n\r\nWhen we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and\r\ncried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that\r\ndon't amount to shucks, and said she'd serve Sid the same when he come.\r\n\r\nAnd the place was plum full of farmers and farmers' wives, to dinner;\r\nand such another clack a body never heard. Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the\r\nworst; her tongue was a-going all the time. She says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Sister Phelps, I've ransacked that-air cabin over, an' I b'lieve\r\nthe nigger was crazy. I says to Sister Damrell--didn't I, Sister\r\nDamrell?--s'I, he's crazy, s'I--them's the very words I said. You all\r\nhearn me: he's crazy, s'I; everything shows it, s'I. Look at that-air\r\ngrindstone, s'I; want to tell _me_'t any cretur 't's in his right mind\r\n's a goin' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone, s'I?\r\nHere sich 'n' sich a person busted his heart; 'n' here so 'n' so\r\npegged along for thirty-seven year, 'n' all that--natcherl son o' Louis\r\nsomebody, 'n' sich everlast'n rubbage. He's plumb crazy, s'I; it's what\r\nI says in the fust place, it's what I says in the middle, 'n' it's what\r\nI says last 'n' all the time--the nigger's crazy--crazy 's Nebokoodneezer,\r\ns'I.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn' look at that-air ladder made out'n rags, Sister Hotchkiss,\u201d says\r\nold Mrs. Damrell; \u201cwhat in the name o' goodness _could_ he ever want\r\nof--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe very words I was a-sayin' no longer ago th'n this minute to Sister\r\nUtterback, 'n' she'll tell you so herself. Sh-she, look at that-air rag\r\nladder, sh-she; 'n' s'I, yes, _look_ at it, s'I--what _could_ he a-wanted\r\nof it, s'I. Sh-she, Sister Hotchkiss, sh-she--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how in the nation'd they ever _git_ that grindstone _in_ there,\r\n_anyway_? 'n' who dug that-air _hole_? 'n' who--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy very _words_, Brer Penrod! I was a-sayin'--pass that-air sasser o'\r\nm'lasses, won't ye?--I was a-sayin' to Sister Dunlap, jist this minute,\r\nhow _did_ they git that grindstone in there, s'I. Without _help_, mind\r\nyou--'thout _help_! _that's_ wher 'tis. Don't tell _me_, s'I; there\r\n_wuz_ help, s'I; 'n' ther' wuz a _plenty_ help, too, s'I; ther's ben a\r\n_dozen_ a-helpin' that nigger, 'n' I lay I'd skin every last nigger on\r\nthis place but _I'd_ find out who done it, s'I; 'n' moreover, s'I--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA _dozen_ says you!--_forty_ couldn't a done every thing that's been\r\ndone. Look at them case-knife saws and things, how tedious they've been\r\nmade; look at that bed-leg sawed off with 'm, a week's work for six men;\r\nlook at that nigger made out'n straw on the bed; and look at--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may _well_ say it, Brer Hightower! It's jist as I was a-sayin'\r\nto Brer Phelps, his own self. S'e, what do _you_ think of it, Sister\r\nHotchkiss, s'e? Think o' what, Brer Phelps, s'I? Think o' that bed-leg\r\nsawed off that a way, s'e? _think_ of it, s'I? I lay it never sawed\r\n_itself_ off, s'I--somebody _sawed_ it, s'I; that's my opinion, take it\r\nor leave it, it mayn't be no 'count, s'I, but sich as 't is, it's my\r\nopinion, s'I, 'n' if any body k'n start a better one, s'I, let him _do_\r\nit, s'I, that's all. I says to Sister Dunlap, s'I--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, dog my cats, they must a ben a house-full o' niggers in there\r\nevery night for four weeks to a done all that work, Sister Phelps. Look\r\nat that shirt--every last inch of it kivered over with secret African\r\nwrit'n done with blood! Must a ben a raft uv 'm at it right along, all\r\nthe time, amost. Why, I'd give two dollars to have it read to me; 'n'\r\nas for the niggers that wrote it, I 'low I'd take 'n' lash 'm t'll--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPeople to _help_ him, Brother Marples! Well, I reckon you'd _think_\r\nso if you'd a been in this house for a while back. Why, they've stole\r\neverything they could lay their hands on--and we a-watching all the time,\r\nmind you. They stole that shirt right off o' the line! and as for that\r\nsheet they made the rag ladder out of, ther' ain't no telling how\r\nmany times they _didn't_ steal that; and flour, and candles, and\r\ncandlesticks, and spoons, and the old warming-pan, and most a thousand\r\nthings that I disremember now, and my new calico dress; and me and\r\nSilas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day _and_ night, as I was\r\na-telling you, and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight\r\nnor sound of them; and here at the last minute, lo and behold you, they\r\nslides right in under our noses and fools us, and not only fools _us_\r\nbut the Injun Territory robbers too, and actuly gets _away_ with that\r\nnigger safe and sound, and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs\r\nright on their very heels at that very time! I tell you, it just bangs\r\nanything I ever _heard_ of. Why, _sperits_ couldn't a done better and\r\nbeen no smarter. And I reckon they must a _been_ sperits--because, _you_\r\nknow our dogs, and ther' ain't no better; well, them dogs never even got\r\non the _track_ of 'm once! You explain _that_ to me if you can!--_any_\r\nof you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it does beat--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLaws alive, I never--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo help me, I wouldn't a be--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_House_-thieves as well as--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGoodnessgracioussakes, I'd a ben afeard to live in sich a--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c'Fraid to _live_!--why, I was that scared I dasn't hardly go to bed, or\r\nget up, or lay down, or _set_ down, Sister Ridgeway. Why, they'd steal\r\nthe very--why, goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a fluster I was\r\nin by the time midnight come last night. I hope to gracious if I warn't\r\nafraid they'd steal some o' the family! I was just to that pass I\r\ndidn't have no reasoning faculties no more. It looks foolish enough\r\n_now_, in the daytime; but I says to myself, there's my two poor boys\r\nasleep, 'way up stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to goodness\r\nI was that uneasy 't I crep' up there and locked 'em in! I _did_. And\r\nanybody would. Because, you know, when you get scared that way, and it\r\nkeeps running on, and getting worse and worse all the time, and your\r\nwits gets to addling, and you get to doing all sorts o' wild things,\r\nand by and by you think to yourself, spos'n I was a boy, and was away up\r\nthere, and the door ain't locked, and you--\u201d She stopped, looking kind\r\nof wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and when her eye\r\nlit on me--I got up and took a walk.\r\n\r\nSays I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that\r\nroom this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little.\r\nSo I done it. But I dasn't go fur, or she'd a sent for me. And when\r\nit was late in the day the people all went, and then I come in and\r\ntold her the noise and shooting waked up me and \u201cSid,\u201d and the door was\r\nlocked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the lightning-rod,\r\nand both of us got hurt a little, and we didn't never want to try _that_\r\nno more. And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas\r\nbefore; and then she said she'd forgive us, and maybe it was all right\r\nenough anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all boys\r\nwas a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as long\r\nas no harm hadn't come of it, she judged she better put in her time\r\nbeing grateful we was alive and well and she had us still, stead of\r\nfretting over what was past and done. So then she kissed me, and patted\r\nme on the head, and dropped into a kind of a brown study; and pretty\r\nsoon jumps up, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, lawsamercy, it's most night, and Sid not come yet! What _has_\r\nbecome of that boy?\u201d\r\n\r\nI see my chance; so I skips up and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI'll run right up to town and get him,\u201d I says.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo you won't,\u201d she says.  \u201cYou'll stay right wher' you are; _one's_\r\nenough to be lost at a time. If he ain't here to supper, your uncle 'll\r\ngo.\u201d\r\n\r\nWell, he warn't there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.\r\n\r\nHe come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn't run across Tom's\r\ntrack. Aunt Sally was a good _deal_ uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said\r\nthere warn't no occasion to be--boys will be boys, he said, and you'll\r\nsee this one turn up in the morning all sound and right. So she had\r\nto be satisfied. But she said she'd set up for him a while anyway, and\r\nkeep a light burning so he could see it.\r\n\r\nAnd then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her\r\ncandle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and like\r\nI couldn't look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talked\r\nwith me a long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn't\r\nseem to want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me every\r\nnow and then if I reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe\r\ndrownded, and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or\r\ndead, and she not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip down\r\nsilent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be home\r\nin the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me,\r\nand tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it, because it done her\r\ngood, and she was in so much trouble. And when she was going away she\r\nlooked down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe door ain't going to be locked, Tom, and there's the window and\r\nthe rod; but you'll be good, _won't_ you? And you won't go? For _my_\r\nsake.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaws knows I _wanted_ to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was all\r\nintending to go; but after that I wouldn't a went, not for kingdoms.\r\n\r\nBut she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless.\r\nAnd twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped around\r\nfront, and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her\r\neyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do\r\nsomething for her, but I couldn't, only to swear that I wouldn't never\r\ndo nothing to grieve her any more. And the third time I waked up at\r\ndawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out,\r\nand her old gray head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn't get no\r\ntrack of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying\r\nnothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not\r\neating anything. And by and by the old man says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDid I give you the letter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat letter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe one I got yesterday out of the post-office.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, you didn't give me no letter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I must a forgot it.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had\r\nlaid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her. She says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it's from St. Petersburg--it's from Sis.\u201d\r\n\r\nI allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn't stir. But\r\nbefore she could break it open she dropped it and run--for she see\r\nsomething. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old\r\ndoctor; and Jim, in _her_ calico dress, with his hands tied behind him;\r\nand a lot of people. I hid the letter behind the first thing that come\r\nhandy, and rushed. She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, he's dead, he's dead, I know he's dead!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,\r\nwhich showed he warn't in his right mind; then she flung up her hands,\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHe's alive, thank God! And that's enough!\u201d and she snatched a kiss of\r\nhim, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders\r\nright and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue\r\ncould go, every jump of the way.\r\n\r\nI followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the\r\nold doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house. The men\r\nwas very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to\r\nall the other niggers around there, so they wouldn't be trying to run\r\naway like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a\r\nwhole family scared most to death for days and nights. But the others\r\nsaid, don't do it, it wouldn't answer at all; he ain't our nigger, and\r\nhis owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure. So that cooled\r\nthem down a little, because the people that's always the most anxious\r\nfor to hang a nigger that hain't done just right is always the very\r\nones that ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got their\r\nsatisfaction out of him.\r\n\r\nThey cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the\r\nhead once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let on to\r\nknow me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes\r\non him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to\r\na big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and\r\nboth legs, and said he warn't to have nothing but bread and water to\r\neat after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because\r\nhe didn't come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and\r\nsaid a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the\r\ncabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and\r\nabout this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with\r\na kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes and\r\ntakes a look, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDon't be no rougher on him than you're obleeged to, because he ain't\r\na bad nigger. When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn't cut\r\nthe bullet out without some help, and he warn't in no condition for\r\nme to leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little\r\nworse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn't let\r\nme come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he'd kill\r\nme, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn't do\r\nanything at all with him; so I says, I got to have _help_ somehow; and\r\nthe minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says\r\nhe'll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well. Of course I\r\njudged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I _was_! and there I had\r\nto stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night. It\r\nwas a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and\r\nof course I'd of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn't,\r\nbecause the nigger might get away, and then I'd be to blame; and yet\r\nnever a skiff come close enough for me to hail. So there I had to stick\r\nplumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a\r\nbetter nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it,\r\nand was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he'd been worked\r\nmain hard lately. I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a\r\nnigger like that is worth a thousand dollars--and kind treatment, too. I\r\nhad everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he\r\nwould a done at home--better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I\r\n_was_, with both of 'm on my hands, and there I had to stick till about\r\ndawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck\r\nwould have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped\r\non his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped\r\nup on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was\r\nabout, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a\r\nflighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and\r\ntowed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least\r\nrow nor said a word from the start. He ain't no bad nigger, gentlemen;\r\nthat's what I think about him.\u201d\r\n\r\nSomebody says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it sounds very good, doctor, I'm obleeged to say.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful\r\nto that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was\r\naccording to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good\r\nheart in him and was a good man the first time I see him. Then they\r\nall agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some\r\nnotice took of it, and reward. So every one of them promised, right out\r\nand hearty, that they wouldn't cuss him no more.\r\n\r\nThen they come out and locked him up. I hoped they was going to say he\r\ncould have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten\r\nheavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they\r\ndidn't think of it, and I reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in, but\r\nI judged I'd get the doctor's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as\r\nsoon as I'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of\r\nme--explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot\r\nwhen I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling\r\naround hunting the runaway nigger.\r\n\r\nBut I had plenty time. Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day\r\nand all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNext morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt\r\nSally was gone to get a nap. So I slips to the sick-room, and if I\r\nfound him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that\r\nwould wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and\r\npale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come. So I set down and\r\nlaid for him to wake. In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding\r\nin, and there I was, up a stump again! She motioned me to be still, and\r\nset down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful\r\nnow, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been sleeping\r\nlike that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the\r\ntime, and ten to one he'd wake up in his right mind.\r\n\r\nSo we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his\r\neyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cHello!--why, I'm at _home_! How's that? Where's the raft?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's all right,\u201d I says.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd _Jim_?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe same,\u201d I says, but couldn't say it pretty brash. But he never\r\nnoticed, but says:\r\n\r\n\u201cGood! Splendid! _Now_ we're all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?\u201d\r\n\r\nI was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:  \u201cAbout what, Sid?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, about the way the whole thing was done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat whole thing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, _the_ whole thing. There ain't but one; how we set the runaway\r\nnigger free--me and Tom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood land! Set the run--What _is_ the child talking about! Dear, dear,\r\nout of his head again!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_No_, I ain't out of my _head_; I know all what I'm talking about. We\r\n_did_ set him free--me and Tom. We laid out to do it, and we _done_ it.\r\nAnd we done it elegant, too.\u201d He'd got a start, and she never checked\r\nhim up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and\r\nI see it warn't no use for _me_ to put in.  \u201cWhy, Aunty, it cost us a\r\npower of work--weeks of it--hours and hours, every night, whilst you was\r\nall asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt,\r\nand your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the\r\nwarming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things,\r\nand you can't think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and\r\ninscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can't think _half_ the\r\nfun it was. And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things,\r\nand nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the\r\nlightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder\r\nand send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work\r\nwith in your apron pocket--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMercy sakes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c--and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for\r\nJim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that\r\nyou come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before\r\nwe was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let\r\ndrive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let\r\nthem go by, and when the dogs come they warn't interested in us, but\r\nwent for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the\r\nraft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by\r\nourselves, and _wasn't_ it bully, Aunty!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days! So it was\r\n_you_, you little rapscallions, that's been making all this trouble,\r\nand turned everybody's wits clean inside out and scared us all most to\r\ndeath. I've as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out\r\no' you this very minute. To think, here I've been, night after night,\r\na--_you_ just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I'll tan the Old\r\nHarry out o' both o' ye!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Tom, he _was_ so proud and joyful, he just _couldn't_ hold in,\r\nand his tongue just _went_ it--she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all\r\nalong, and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and she\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\u201c_Well_, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it _now_, for mind I\r\ntell you if I catch you meddling with him again--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMeddling with _who_?\u201d Tom says, dropping his smile and looking\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\n\u201cWith _who_? Why, the runaway nigger, of course. Who'd you reckon?\u201d\r\n\r\nTom looks at me very grave, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cTom, didn't you just tell me he was all right? Hasn't he got away?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Him_?\u201d says Aunt Sally; \u201cthe runaway nigger?  'Deed he hasn't.\r\nThey've got him back, safe and sound, and he's in that cabin again,\r\non bread and water, and loaded down with chains, till he's claimed or\r\nsold!\u201d\r\n\r\nTom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening\r\nand shutting like gills, and sings out to me:\r\n\r\n\u201cThey hain't no _right_ to shut him up! SHOVE!--and don't you lose a\r\nminute. Turn him loose! he ain't no slave; he's as free as any cretur\r\nthat walks this earth!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat _does_ the child mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI mean every word I _say_, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don't go, _I'll_\r\ngo. I've knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there. Old Miss\r\nWatson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to\r\nsell him down the river, and _said_ so; and she set him free in her\r\nwill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen what on earth did _you_ want to set him free for, seeing he was\r\nalready free?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that _is_ a question, I must say; and just like women! Why,\r\nI wanted the _adventure_ of it; and I'd a waded neck-deep in blood\r\nto--goodness alive, _Aunt Polly!_\u201d\r\n\r\nIf she warn't standing right there, just inside the door, looking as\r\nsweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!\r\n\r\nAunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and\r\ncried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed,\r\nfor it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me. And I peeped\r\nout, and in a little while Tom's Aunt Polly shook herself loose and\r\nstood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles--kind of grinding\r\nhim into the earth, you know. And then she says:\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, you _better_ turn y'r head away--I would if I was you, Tom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, deary me!\u201d says Aunt Sally; \u201c_Is_ he changed so? Why, that ain't\r\n_Tom_, it's Sid; Tom's--Tom's--why, where is Tom? He was here a minute\r\nago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean where's Huck _Finn_--that's what you mean! I reckon I hain't\r\nraised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I\r\n_see_ him. That _would_ be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that\r\nbed, Huck Finn.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo I done it. But not feeling brash.\r\n\r\nAunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever\r\nsee--except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told\r\nit all to him. It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn't\r\nknow nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting\r\nsermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the\r\noldest man in the world couldn't a understood it. So Tom's Aunt Polly,\r\nshe told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how\r\nI was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom\r\nSawyer--she chipped in and says, \u201cOh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I'm\r\nused to it now, and 'tain't no need to change\u201d--that when Aunt Sally took\r\nme for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it--there warn't no other way, and\r\nI knowed he wouldn't mind, because it would be nuts for him, being\r\na mystery, and he'd make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly\r\nsatisfied. And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made\r\nthings as soft as he could for me.\r\n\r\nAnd his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting\r\nJim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took\r\nall that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn't\r\never understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he _could_\r\nhelp a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.\r\n\r\nWell, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and\r\n_Sid_ had come all right and safe, she says to herself:\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at that, now! I might have expected it, letting him go off that\r\nway without anybody to watch him. So now I got to go and trapse all\r\nthe way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that\r\ncreetur's up to _this_ time, as long as I couldn't seem to get any\r\nanswer out of you about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I never heard nothing from you,\u201d says Aunt Sally.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I wonder! Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean\r\nby Sid being here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I never got 'em, Sis.\u201d\r\n\r\nAunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou, Tom!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell--_what_?\u201d he says, kind of pettish.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon't you what _me_, you impudent thing--hand out them letters.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat letters?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Them_ letters. I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you I'll--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey're in the trunk. There, now. And they're just the same as they\r\nwas when I got them out of the office. I hain't looked into them, I\r\nhain't touched them. But I knowed they'd make trouble, and I thought if\r\nyou warn't in no hurry, I'd--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you _do_ need skinning, there ain't no mistake about it. And I\r\nwrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s'pose he--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it come yesterday; I hain't read it yet, but _it's_ all right, I've\r\ngot that one.\u201d\r\n\r\nI wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn't, but I reckoned maybe it\r\nwas just as safe to not to. So I never said nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE LAST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea, time\r\nof the evasion?--what it was he'd planned to do if the evasion worked all\r\nright and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before?\r\nAnd he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we got\r\nJim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft, and\r\nhave adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him about\r\nhis being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style,\r\nand pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all\r\nthe niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight\r\nprocession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would\r\nwe. But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was.\r\n\r\nWe had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle\r\nSilas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom,\r\nthey made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him\r\nall he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do. And we had\r\nhim up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty\r\ndollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good,\r\nand Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDah, now, Huck, what I tell you?--what I tell you up dah on Jackson\r\nislan'? I _tole_ you I got a hairy breas', en what's de sign un it; en\r\nI _tole_ you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich _agin_; en it's\r\ncome true; en heah she is! _dah_, now! doan' talk to _me_--signs is\r\n_signs_, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis' 's well 'at I 'uz gwineter be\r\nrich agin as I's a-stannin' heah dis minute!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le's all three\r\nslide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for\r\nhowling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a\r\ncouple of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I\r\nain't got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn't get\r\nnone from home, because it's likely pap's been back before now, and got\r\nit all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, he hain't,\u201d Tom says; \u201cit's all there yet--six thousand dollars\r\nand more; and your pap hain't ever been back since. Hadn't when I come\r\naway, anyhow.\u201d\r\n\r\nJim says, kind of solemn:\r\n\r\n\u201cHe ain't a-comin' back no mo', Huck.\u201d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Jim?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNemmine why, Huck--but he ain't comin' back no mo.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut I kept at him; so at last he says:\r\n\r\n\u201cDoan' you 'member de house dat was float'n down de river, en dey wuz a\r\nman in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn' let you\r\ncome in? Well, den, you kin git yo' money when you wants it, kase dat\r\nwuz him.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom's most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard\r\nfor a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain't\r\nnothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I'd\r\na knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn't a tackled it,\r\nand ain't a-going to no more. But I reckon I got to light out for the\r\nTerritory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me\r\nand sivilize me, and I can't stand it. I been there before.\r\n\r\nTHE END.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProduced by David Widger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN SCIENCE\r\n\r\nby Mark Twain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nBook I of this volume occupies a quarter or a third of the volume,\r\nand consists of matter written about four years ago, but not hitherto\r\npublished in book form. It contained errors of judgment and of fact. I\r\nhave now corrected these to the best of my ability and later knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nBook II was written at the beginning of 1903, and has not until\r\nnow appeared in any form. In it my purpose has been to present a\r\ncharacter-portrait of Mrs. Eddy, drawn from her own acts and words\r\nsolely, not from hearsay and rumor; and to explain the nature and scope\r\nof her Monarchy, as revealed in the Laws by which she governs it, and\r\nwhich she wrote herself.\r\n\r\nMARK TWAIN\r\n\r\nNEW YORK. January, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I CHRISTIAN SCIENCE\r\n\r\n     \u201cIt is the first time since the dawn-days of Creation that\r\n     a Voice has gone crashing through space with such\r\n     placid and complacent confidence and command.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nVIENNA 1899.\r\n\r\nThis last summer, when I was on my way back to Vienna from the\r\nAppetite-Cure in the mountains, I fell over a cliff in the twilight, and\r\nbroke some arms and legs and one thing or another, and by good luck was\r\nfound by some peasants who had lost an ass, and they carried me to the\r\nnearest habitation, which was one of those large, low, thatch-roofed\r\nfarm-houses, with apartments in the garret for the family, and a cunning\r\nlittle porch under the deep gable decorated with boxes of bright colored\r\nflowers and cats; on the ground floor a large and light sitting-room,\r\nseparated from the milch-cattle apartment by a partition; and in the\r\nfront yard rose stately and fine the wealth and pride of the house, the\r\nmanure-pile. That sentence is Germanic, and shows that I am acquiring\r\nthat sort of mastery of the art and spirit of the language which enables\r\na man to travel all day in one sentence without changing cars.\r\n\r\nThere was a village a mile away, and a horse doctor lived there, but\r\nthere was no surgeon. It seemed a bad outlook; mine was distinctly\r\na surgery case. Then it was remembered that a lady from Boston was\r\nsummering in that village, and she was a Christian Science doctor and\r\ncould cure anything. So she was sent for. It was night by this time, and\r\nshe could not conveniently come, but sent word that it was no matter,\r\nthere was no hurry, she would give me \u201cabsent treatment\u201d now, and come\r\nin the morning; meantime she begged me to make myself tranquil and\r\ncomfortable and remember that there was nothing the matter with me. I\r\nthought there must be some mistake.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you tell her I walked off a cliff seventy-five feet high?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd struck a boulder at the bottom and bounced?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd struck another one and bounced again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd struck another one and bounced yet again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd broke the boulders?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat accounts for it; she is thinking of the boulders. Why didn't you\r\ntell her I got hurt, too?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did. I told her what you told me to tell her: that you were now\r\nbut an incoherent series of compound fractures extending from your\r\nscalp-lock to your heels, and that the comminuted projections caused you\r\nto look like a hat-rack.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd it was after this that she wished me to remember that there was\r\nnothing the matter with me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThose were her words.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not understand it. I believe she has not diagnosed the case with\r\nsufficient care. Did she look like a person who was theorizing, or did\r\nshe look like one who has fallen off precipices herself and brings to\r\nthe aid of abstract science the confirmations of personal experience?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBitte?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was too large a contract for the Stubenmadchen's vocabulary; she\r\ncouldn't call the hand. I allowed the subject to rest there, and asked\r\nfor something to eat and smoke, and something hot to drink, and a basket\r\nto pile my legs in; but I could not have any of these things.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe said you would need nothing at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I am hungry and thirsty, and in desperate pain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe said you would have these delusions, but must pay no attention\r\nto them. She wants you to particularly remember that there are no such\r\nthings as hunger and thirst and pain.''\r\n\r\n\u201cShe does does she?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is what she said.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes she seem to be in full and functionable possession of her\r\nintellectual plant, such as it is?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBitte?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo they let her run at large, or do they tie her up?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTie her up?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, good-night, run along, you are a good girl, but your mental\r\nGeschirr is not arranged for light and airy conversation. Leave me to my\r\ndelusions.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nIt was a night of anguish, of course--at least, I supposed it was, for\r\nit had all the symptoms of it--but it passed at last, and the Christian\r\nScientist came, and I was glad She was middle-aged, and large and bony,\r\nand erect, and had an austere face and a resolute jaw and a Roman beak\r\nand was a widow in the third degree, and her name was Fuller. I was\r\neager to get to business and find relief, but she was distressingly\r\ndeliberate. She unpinned and unhooked and uncoupled her upholsteries one\r\nby one, abolished the wrinkles with a flirt of her hand, and hung the\r\narticles up; peeled off her gloves and disposed of them, got a book out\r\nof her hand-bag, then drew a chair to the bedside, descended into it\r\nwithout hurry, and I hung out my tongue. She said, with pity but without\r\npassion:\r\n\r\n\u201cReturn it to its receptacle. We deal with the mind only, not with its\r\ndumb servants.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could not offer my pulse, because the connection was broken; but she\r\ndetected the apology before I could word it, and indicated by a negative\r\ntilt of her head that the pulse was another dumb servant that she had no\r\nuse for. Then I thought I would tell her my symptoms and how I felt, so\r\nthat she would understand the case; but that was another inconsequence,\r\nshe did not need to know those things; moreover, my remark about how I\r\nfelt was an abuse of language, a misapplication of terms.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne does not feel,\u201d she explained; \u201cthere is no such thing as\r\nfeeling: therefore, to speak of a non-existent thing as existent is a\r\ncontradiction. Matter has no existence; nothing exists but mind; the\r\nmind cannot feel pain, it can only imagine it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut if it hurts, just the same--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt doesn't. A thing which is unreal cannot exercise the functions of\r\nreality. Pain is unreal; hence, pain cannot hurt.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn making a sweeping gesture to indicate the act of shooing the illusion\r\nof pain out of the mind, she raked her hand on a pin in her dress, said\r\n\u201cOuch!\u201d and went tranquilly on with her talk. \u201cYou should never allow\r\nyourself to speak of how you feel, nor permit others to ask you how\r\nyou are feeling; you should never concede that you are ill, nor permit\r\nothers to talk about disease or pain or death or similar nonexistences\r\nin your presence. Such talk only encourages the mind to continue its\r\nempty imaginings.\u201d Just at that point the Stuben-madchen trod on the\r\ncat's tail, and the cat let fly a frenzy of cat-profanity. I asked, with\r\ncaution:\r\n\r\n\u201cIs a cat's opinion about pain valuable?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA cat has no opinion; opinions proceed from mind only; the lower\r\nanimals, being eternally perishable, have not been granted mind; without\r\nmind, opinion is impossible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe merely imagined she felt a pain--the cat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe cannot imagine a pain, for imagining is an effect of mind; without\r\nmind, there is no imagination. A cat has no imagination.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen she had a real pain?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have already told you there is no such thing as real pain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is strange and interesting. I do wonder what was the matter with\r\nthe cat. Because, there being no such thing as a real pain, and she not\r\nbeing able to imagine an imaginary one, it would seem that God in His\r\npity has compensated the cat with some kind of a mysterious emotion\r\nusable when her tail is trodden on which, for the moment, joins cat and\r\nChristian in one common brotherhood of--\u201d\r\n\r\nShe broke in with an irritated--\r\n\r\n\u201cPeace! The cat feels nothing, the Christian feels nothing. Your empty\r\nand foolish imaginings are profanation and blasphemy, and can do you an\r\ninjury. It is wiser and better and holier to recognize and confess that\r\nthere is no such thing as disease or pain or death.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am full of imaginary tortures,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I do not think I could\r\nbe any more uncomfortable if they were real ones. What must I do to get\r\nrid of them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no occasion to get rid of them since they do not exist. They\r\nare illusions propagated by matter, and matter has no existence; there\r\nis no such thing as matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt sounds right and clear, but yet it seems in a degree elusive; it\r\nseems to slip through, just when you think you are getting a grip on\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExplain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, for instance: if there is no such thing as matter, how can matter\r\npropagate things?\u201d\r\n\r\nIn her compassion she almost smiled. She would have smiled if there were\r\nany such thing as a smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is quite simple,\u201d she said; \u201cthe fundamental propositions of\r\nChristian Science explain it, and they are summarized in the four\r\nfollowing self-evident propositions: 1. God is All in all. 2. God is\r\ngood. Good is Mind 3. God, Spirit, being all, nothing is matter 4. Life,\r\nGod, omnipotent Good, deny death, evil, sin, disease.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere--now you see.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt seemed nebulous; it did not seem to say anything about the difficulty\r\nin hand--how non-existent matter can propagate illusions I said, with\r\nsome hesitancy:\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes--does it explain?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoesn't it? Even if read backward it will do it.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a budding hope, I asked her to do it backwards.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well. Disease sin evil death deny Good omnipotent God life matter\r\nis nothing all being Spirit God Mind is Good good is God all in All is\r\nGod. There do you understand now?\r\n\r\n\u201cIt--it--well, it is plainer than it was before; still--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCould you try it some more ways?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs many as you like; it always means the same. Interchanged in any way\r\nyou please it cannot be made to mean anything different from what it\r\nmeans when put in any other way. Because it is perfect. You can jumble\r\nit all up, and it makes no difference: it always comes out the way it\r\nwas before. It was a marvelous mind that produced it. As a mental tour\r\nde force it is without a mate, it defies alike the simple, the concrete,\r\nand the occult.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to be a corker.\u201d\r\n\r\nI blushed for the word, but it was out before I could stop it.\r\n\r\n\u201cA what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA--wonderful structure--combination, so to speak, of profound\r\nthoughts--unthinkable ones--um--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is true. Read backward, or forward, or perpendicularly, or at any\r\ngiven angle, these four propositions will always be found to agree in\r\nstatement and proof.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh--proof. Now we are coming at it. The statements agree; they agree\r\nwith--with--anyway, they agree; I noticed that; but what is it they\r\nprove I mean, in particular?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, nothing could be clearer. They prove:\r\n\r\n\u201c1. GOD--Principle, Life, Truth, Love, Soul, Spirit, Mind. Do you get\r\nthat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI--well, I seem to. Go on, please.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c2. MAN--God's universal idea, individual, perfect, eternal. Is it\r\nclear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt--I think so. Continue.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c3. IDEA--An image in Mind; the immediate object of understanding. There\r\nit is--the whole sublime Arcana of Christian Science in a nutshell. Do\r\nyou find a weak place in it anywhere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell--no; it seems strong.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well There is more. Those three constitute the Scientific\r\nDefinition of Immortal Mind. Next, we have the Scientific Definition\r\nof Mortal Mind. Thus. FIRST DEGREE: Depravity I. Physical-Passions and\r\nappetites, fear, depraved will, pride, envy, deceit, hatred, revenge,\r\nsin, disease, death.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPhantasms, madam--unrealities, as I understand it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery one. SECOND DEGREE: Evil Disappearing. I. Moral-Honesty,\r\naffection, compassion, hope, faith, meekness, temperance. Is it clear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCrystal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTHIRD DEGREE: Spiritual Salvation. I. Spiritual-Faith, wisdom, power,\r\npurity, understanding, health, love. You see how searchingly and\r\nco-ordinately interdependent and anthropomorphous it all is. In this\r\nThird Degree, as we know by the revelations of Christian Science, mortal\r\nmind disappears.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot earlier?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, not until the teaching and preparation for the Third Degree are\r\ncompleted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not until then that one is enabled to take hold of Christian\r\nScience effectively, and with the right sense of sympathy and kinship,\r\nas I understand you. That is to say, it could not succeed during the\r\nprocesses of the Second Degree, because there would still be remains\r\nof mind left; and therefore--but I interrupted you. You were about\r\nto further explain the good results proceeding from the erosions and\r\ndisintegrations effected by the Third Degree. It is very interesting; go\r\non, please.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, as I was saying, in this Third Degree mortal mind disappears.\r\nScience so reverses the evidence before the corporeal human senses as\r\nto make this scriptural testimony true in our hearts, 'the last shall\r\nbe first and the first shall be last,' that God and His idea may be to\r\nus--what divinity really is, and must of necessity be all-inclusive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is beautiful. And with what exhaustive exactness your choice and\r\narrangement of words confirm and establish what you have claimed for\r\nthe powers and functions of the Third Degree. The Second could probably\r\nproduce only temporary absence of mind; it is reserved to the Third to\r\nmake it permanent. A sentence framed under the auspices of the\r\nSecond could have a kind of meaning--a sort of deceptive semblance of\r\nit--whereas it is only under the magic of the Third that that defect\r\nwould disappear. Also, without doubt, it is the Third Degree that\r\ncontributes another remarkable specialty to Christian Science--viz.,\r\nease and flow and lavishness of words, and rhythm and swing and\r\nsmoothness. There must be a special reason for this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes--God--all, all--God, good God, non-Matter, Matteration, Spirit,\r\nBones, Truth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat explains it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is nothing in Christian Science that is not explicable; for God\r\nis one, Time is one, Individuality is one, and may be one of a series,\r\none of many, as an individual man, individual horse; whereas God is one,\r\nnot one of a series, but one alone and without an equal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThese are noble thoughts. They make one burn to know more. How does\r\nChristian Science explain the spiritual relation of systematic duality\r\nto incidental deflection?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cChristian Science reverses the seeming relation of Soul and body--as\r\nastronomy reverses the human perception of the movement of the solar\r\nsystem--and makes body tributary to the Mind. As it is the earth which\r\nis in motion, While the sun is at rest, though in viewing the sun rise\r\none finds it impossible to believe the sun not to be really rising, so\r\nthe body is but the humble servant of the restful Mind, though it seems\r\notherwise to finite sense; but we shall never understand this while we\r\nadmit that soul is in body, or mind in matter, and that man is included\r\nin non-intelligence. Soul is God, unchangeable and eternal; and man\r\ncoexists with and reflects Soul, for the All-in-all is the Altogether,\r\nand the Altogether embraces the All-one, Soul-Mind, Mind-Soul, Love,\r\nSpirit, Bones, Liver, one of a series, alone and without an equal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the origin of Christian Science? Is it a gift of God, or did it\r\njust happen?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn a sense, it is a gift of God. That is to say, its powers are from\r\nHim, but the credit of the discovery of the powers and what they are for\r\nis due to an American lady.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed? When did this occur?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn 1866. That is the immortal date when pain and disease and death\r\ndisappeared from the earth to return no more forever. That is, the\r\nfancies for which those terms stand disappeared. The things themselves\r\nhad never existed; therefore, as soon as it was perceived that there\r\nwere no such things, they were easily banished. The history and nature\r\nof the great discovery are set down in the book here, and--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid the lady write the book?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, she wrote it all, herself. The title is Science and Health, with\r\nKey to the Scriptures--for she explains the Scriptures; they were not\r\nunderstood before. Not even by the twelve Disciples. She begins thus--I\r\nwill read it to you.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut she had forgotten to bring her glasses.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is no matter,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember the words--indeed, all\r\nChristian Scientists know the book by heart; it is necessary in our\r\npractice. We should otherwise make mistakes and do harm. She begins\r\nthus: 'In the year 1866 I discovered the Science of Metaphysical\r\nHealing, and named it Christian Science.' And She says quite\r\nbeautifully, I think--'Through Christian Science, religion and medicine\r\nare inspired with a diviner nature and essence, fresh pinions are\r\ngiven to faith and understanding, and thoughts acquaint themselves\r\nintelligently with God.' Her very words.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is elegant. And it is a fine thought, too--marrying religion to\r\nmedicine, instead of medicine to the undertaker in the old way; for\r\nreligion and medicine properly belong together, they being the basis of\r\nall spiritual and physical health. What kind of medicine do you give for\r\nthe ordinary diseases, such as--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe never give medicine in any circumstances whatever! We--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, madam, it says--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't care what it says, and I don't wish to talk about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sorry if I have offended, but you see the mention seemed in some\r\nway inconsistent, and--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are no inconsistencies in Christian Science. The thing is\r\nimpossible, for the Science is absolute. It cannot be otherwise, since\r\nit proceeds directly from the All-in-all and the Everything-in-Which,\r\nalso Soul, Bones, Truth, one of a series, alone and without equal. It is\r\nMathematics purified from material dross and made spiritual.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can see that, but--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt rests upon the immovable basis of an Apodictical Principle.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe word flattened itself against my mind in trying to get in, and\r\ndisordered me a little, and before I could inquire into its pertinency,\r\nshe was already throwing the needed light:\r\n\r\n\u201cThis Apodictical Principle is the absolute Principle of Scientific\r\nMind-healing, the sovereign Omnipotence which delivers the children of\r\nmen from pain, disease, decay, and every ill that flesh is heir to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely not every ill, every decay?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery one; there are no exceptions; there is no such thing as decay--it\r\nis an unreality, it has no existence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut without your glasses your failing eyesight does not permit you\r\nto--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy eyesight cannot fail; nothing can fail; the Mind is master, and the\r\nMind permits no retrogression.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was under the inspiration of the Third Degree, therefore there could\r\nbe no profit in continuing this part of the subject. I shifted to other\r\nground and inquired further concerning the Discoverer of the Science.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid the discovery come suddenly, like Klondike, or after long study and\r\ncalculation, like America?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe comparisons are not respectful, since they refer to\r\ntrivialities--but let it pass. I will answer in the Discoverer's own\r\nwords: 'God had been graciously fitting me, during many years, for the\r\nreception of a final revelation of the absolute Principle of Scientific\r\nMind-healing.'\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMany years. How many?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEighteen centuries!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll--God, God--good, good--God, Truth, Bones, Liver, one of a series,\r\nalone and without equal--it is amazing!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may well say it, sir. Yet it is but the truth This American lady,\r\nour revered and sacred Founder, is distinctly referred to, and her\r\ncoming prophesied, in the twelfth chapter of the Apocalypse; she could\r\nnot have been more plainly indicated by St. John without actually\r\nmentioning her name.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow strange, how wonderful!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will quote her own words, from her Key to the Scriptures: 'The\r\ntwelfth chapter of the Apocalypse has a special suggestiveness in\r\nconnection with this nineteenth century.' There--do you note that?\r\nThink--note it well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut--what does it mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cListen, and you will know. I quote her inspired words again: 'In the\r\nopening of the Sixth Seal, typical of six thousand years since Adam,\r\nthere is one distinctive feature which has special reference to the\r\npresent age. Thus:\r\n\r\n\u201c'Revelation xii. I. And there appeared a great wonder in heaven--a\r\nwoman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her\r\nhead a crown of twelve stars.'\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is our Head, our Chief, our Discoverer of Christian\r\nScience--nothing can be plainer, nothing surer. And note this:\r\n\r\n\u201c'Revelation xii. 6. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she\r\nhad a place prepared of God.'\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is Boston. I recognize it, madam. These are sublime things, and\r\nimpressive; I never understood these passages before; please go on with\r\nthe--with the--proofs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well. Listen:\r\n\r\n\u201c'And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a\r\ncloud; and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the\r\nsun, and his feet as pillars of fire. And he held in his hand a little\r\nbook.'\r\n\r\n\u201cA little book, merely a little book--could words be modester? Yet how\r\nstupendous its importance! Do you know what book that was?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas it--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hold it in my hand--Christian Science!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLove, Livers, Lights, Bones, Truth, Kidneys, one of a series, alone and\r\nwithout equal--it is beyond imagination for wonder!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHear our Founder's eloquent words: 'Then will a voice from harmony cry,\r\n\u201cGo and take the little book: take it and eat it up, and it shall make\r\nthy belly bitter; but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.\u201d\r\n Mortal, obey the heavenly evangel. Take up Divine Science. Read it from\r\nbeginning to end. Study it, ponder it. It will be, indeed, sweet at its\r\nfirst taste, when it heals you; but murmur not over Truth, if you find\r\nits digestion bitter.' You now know the history of our dear and holy\r\nScience, sir, and that its origin is not of this earth, but only its\r\ndiscovery. I will leave the book with you and will go, now; but give\r\nyourself no uneasiness--I will give you absent treatment from now till I\r\ngo to bed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nUnder the powerful influence of the near treatment and the absent\r\ntreatment together, my bones were gradually retreating inward and\r\ndisappearing from view. The good work took a brisk start, now, and went\r\non swiftly. My body was diligently straining and stretching, this way\r\nand that, to accommodate the processes of restoration, and every minute\r\nor two I heard a dull click inside and knew that the two ends of\r\na fracture had been successfully joined. This muffled clicking and\r\ngritting and grinding and rasping continued during the next three\r\nhours, and then stopped--the connections had all been made. All except\r\ndislocations; there were only seven of these: hips, shoulders, knees,\r\nneck; so that was soon over; one after another they slipped into their\r\nsockets with a sound like pulling a distant cork, and I jumped up as\r\ngood as new, as to framework, and sent for the horse-doctor.\r\n\r\nI was obliged to do this because I had a stomach-ache and a cold in\r\nthe head, and I was not willing to trust these things any longer in the\r\nhands of a woman whom I did not know, and whose ability to successfully\r\ntreat mere disease I had lost all confidence. My position was justified\r\nby the fact that the cold and the ache had been in her charge from the\r\nfirst, along with the fractures, but had experienced not a shade of\r\nrelief; and, indeed, the ache was even growing worse and worse, and more\r\nand more bitter, now, probably on account of the protracted abstention\r\nfrom food and drink.\r\n\r\nThe horse-doctor came, a pleasant man and full of hope and professional\r\ninterest in the case. In the matter of smell he was pretty aromatic--in\r\nfact, quite horsy--and I tried to arrange with him for absent treatment,\r\nbut it was not in his line, so, out of delicacy, I did not press it.\r\nHe looked at my teeth and examined my hock, and said my age and general\r\ncondition were favorable to energetic measures; therefore he would give\r\nme something to turn the stomach-ache into the botts and the cold in\r\nthe head into the blind staggers; then he should be on his own beat\r\nand would know what to do. He made up a bucket of bran-mash, and said\r\na dipperful of it every two hours, alternated with a drench with\r\nturpentine and axle-grease in it, would either knock my ailments out of\r\nme in twenty-four hours, or so interest me in other ways as to make me\r\nforget they were on the premises. He administered my first dose himself,\r\nthen took his leave, saying I was free to eat and drink anything I\r\npleased and in any quantity I liked. But I was not hungry any more, and\r\ndid not care for food.\r\n\r\nI took up the Christian Science book and read half of it, then took a\r\ndipperful of drench and read the other half. The resulting experiences\r\nwere full of interest and adventure. All through the rumblings and\r\ngrindings and quakings and effervescings accompanying the evolution of\r\nthe ache into the botts and the cold into the blind staggers I could\r\nnote the generous struggle for mastery going on between the mash and the\r\ndrench and the literature; and often I could tell which was ahead, and\r\ncould easily distinguish the literature from the others when the others\r\nwere separate, though not when they were mixed; for when a bran-mash\r\nand an eclectic drench are mixed together they look just like the\r\nApodictical Principle out on a lark, and no one can tell it from that.\r\nThe finish was reached at last, the evolutions were complete, and a\r\nfine success, but I think that this result could have been achieved with\r\nfewer materials. I believe the mash was necessary to the conversion of\r\nthe stomach-ache into the botts, but I think one could develop the blind\r\nstaggers out of the literature by itself; also, that blind staggers\r\nproduced in this way would be of a better quality and more lasting than\r\nany produced by the artificial processes of the horse-doctor.\r\n\r\nFor of all the strange and frantic and incomprehensible and\r\nuninterpretable books which the imagination of man has created, surely\r\nthis one is the prize sample. It is written with a limitless confidence\r\nand complacency, and with a dash and stir and earnestness which often\r\ncompel the effects of eloquence, even when the words do not seem to\r\nhave any traceable meaning. There are plenty of people who imagine they\r\nunderstand the book; I know this, for I have talked with them; but in\r\nall cases they were people who also imagined that there were no such\r\nthings as pain, sickness, and death, and no realities in the world;\r\nnothing actually existent but Mind. It seems to me to modify the value\r\nof their testimony. When these people talk about Christian Science\r\nthey do as Mrs. Fuller did: they do not use their own language, but the\r\nbook's; they pour out the book's showy incoherences, and leave you to\r\nfind out later that they were not originating, but merely quoting;\r\nthey seem to know the volume by heart, and to revere it as they would\r\na Bible--another Bible, perhaps I ought to say. Plainly the book was\r\nwritten under the mental desolations of the Third Degree, and I feel\r\nsure that none but the membership of that Degree can discover meanings\r\nin it. When you read it you seem to be listening to a lively and\r\naggressive and oracular speech delivered in an unknown tongue, a speech\r\nwhose spirit you get but not the particulars; or, to change the figure,\r\nyou seem to be listening to a vigorous instrument which is making a\r\nnoise which it thinks is a tune, but which, to persons not members of\r\nthe band, is only the martial tooting of a trombone, and merrily stirs\r\nthe soul through the noise, but does not convey a meaning.\r\n\r\nThe book's serenities of self-satisfaction do almost seem to smack of\r\na heavenly origin--they have no blood-kin in the earth. It is more than\r\nhuman to be so placidly certain about things, and so finely superior,\r\nand so airily content with one's performance. Without ever presenting\r\nanything which may rightfully be called by the strong name of Evidence,\r\nand sometimes without even mentioning a reason for a deduction at all,\r\nit thunders out the startling words, \u201cI have Proved\u201d so and so. It takes\r\nthe Pope and all the great guns of his Church in battery assembled to\r\nauthoritatively settle and establish the meaning of a sole and single\r\nunclarified passage of Scripture, and this at vast cost of time and\r\nstudy and reflection, but the author of this work is superior to all\r\nthat: she finds the whole Bible in an unclarified audition, and at small\r\nexpense of time and no expense of mental effort she clarifies it from\r\nlid to lid, reorganizes and improves the meanings, then authoritatively\r\nsettles and establishes them with formulas which you cannot tell from\r\n\u201cLet there be light!\u201d and \u201cHere you have it!\u201d It is the first time since\r\nthe dawn-days of Creation that a Voice has gone crashing through space\r\nwith such placid and complacent confidence and command.\r\n\r\n[January, 1903. The first reading of any book whose terminology is\r\nnew and strange is nearly sure to leave the reader in a bewildered and\r\nsarcastic state of mind. But now that, during the past two months,\r\nI have, by diligence gained a fair acquaintanceship with Science and\r\nHealth technicalities, I no longer find the bulk of that work hard to\r\nunderstand.--M. T.]\r\n\r\nP.S. The wisdom harvested from the foregoing thoughts has already done\r\nme a service and saved me a sorrow. Nearly a month ago there came to me\r\nfrom one of the universities a tract by Dr. Edward Anthony Spitzka on\r\nthe \u201cEncephalic Anatomy of the Races.\u201d I judged that my opinion was\r\ndesired by the university, and I was greatly pleased with this attention\r\nand wrote and said I would furnish it as soon as I could. That night\r\nI put my plodding and disheartening Christian Science mining aside and\r\ntook hold of the matter. I wrote an eager chapter, and was expecting to\r\nfinish my opinion the next day, but was called away for a week, and my\r\nmind was soon charged with other interests. It was not until to-day,\r\nafter the lapse of nearly a month, that I happened upon my Encephalic\r\nchapter again. Meantime, the new wisdom had come to me, and I read it\r\nwith shame. I recognized that I had entered upon that work in far from\r\nthe right temper--far from the respectful and judicial spirit which was\r\nits due of reverence. I had begun upon it with the following paragraph\r\nfor fuel:\r\n\r\n\u201cFISSURES OF THE PARIETAL AND OCCIPITAL LOBES (LATERAL SURFACE).--The\r\nPostcentral Fissural Complex--In this hemicerebrum, the postcentral and\r\nsubcentral are combined to form a continuous fissure, attaining a length\r\nof 8.5 cm. Dorsally, the fissure bifurcates, embracing the gyre\r\nindented by the caudal limb of the paracentral. The caudal limb of the\r\npostcentral is joined by a transparietal piece. In all, five additional\r\nrami spring from the combined fissure. A vadum separates it from the\r\nparietal; another from the central.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt humiliates me, now, to see how angry I got over that; and how\r\nscornful. I said that the style was disgraceful; that it was labored and\r\ntumultuous, and in places violent, that the treatment was involved and\r\nerratic, and almost, as a rule, bewildering; that to lack of simplicity\r\nwas added a lack of vocabulary; that there was quite too much feeling\r\nshown; that if I had a dog that would get so excited and incoherent over\r\na tranquil subject like Encephalic Anatomy I would not pay his tax; and\r\nat that point I got excited myself and spoke bitterly of these mongrel\r\ninsanities, and said a person might as well try to understand Science\r\nand Health.\r\n\r\n[I know, now, where the trouble was, and am glad of the interruption\r\nthat saved me from sending my verdict to the university. It makes me\r\ncold to think what those people might have thought of me.--M. T.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nNo one doubts--certainly not I--that the mind exercises a powerful\r\ninfluence over the body. From the beginning of time, the sorcerer, the\r\ninterpreter of dreams, the fortune-teller, the charlatan, the quack,\r\nthe wild medicine-man, the educated physician, the mesmerist, and the\r\nhypnotist have made use of the client's imagination to help them in\r\ntheir work. They have all recognized the potency and availability of\r\nthat force. Physicians cure many patients with a bread pill; they know\r\nthat where the disease is only a fancy, the patient's confidence in the\r\ndoctor will make the bread pill effective.\r\n\r\nFaith in the doctor. Perhaps that is the entire thing. It seems to look\r\nlike it. In old times the King cured the king's evil by the touch of the\r\nroyal hand. He frequently made extraordinary cures. Could his footman\r\nhave done it? No--not in his own clothes. Disguised as the King, could\r\nhe have done it? I think we may not doubt it. I think we may feel sure\r\nthat it was not the King's touch that made the cure in any instance,\r\nbut the patient's faith in the efficacy of a King's touch. Genuine and\r\nremarkable cures have been achieved through contact with the relics of a\r\nsaint. Is it not likely that any other bones would have done as well if\r\nthe substitution had been concealed from the patient? When I was a boy a\r\nfarmer's wife who lived five miles from our village had great fame as\r\na faith-doctor--that was what she called herself. Sufferers came to\r\nher from all around, and she laid her hand upon them and said, \u201cHave\r\nfaith--it is all that is necessary,\u201d and they went away well of their\r\nailments. She was not a religious woman, and pretended to no occult\r\npowers. She said that the patient's faith in her did the work. Several\r\ntimes I saw her make immediate cures of severe toothaches. My mother was\r\nthe patient. In Austria there is a peasant who drives a great trade in\r\nthis sort of industry, and has both the high and the low for patients.\r\nHe gets into prison every now and then for practising without a diploma,\r\nbut his business is as brisk as ever when he gets out, for his work\r\nis unquestionably successful and keeps his reputation high. In Bavaria\r\nthere is a man who performed so many great cures that he had to retire\r\nfrom his profession of stage-carpentering in order to meet the demand\r\nof his constantly increasing body of customers. He goes on from year\r\nto year doing his miracles, and has become very rich. He pretends to no\r\nreligious helps, no supernatural aids, but thinks there is something in\r\nhis make-up which inspires the confidence of his patients, and that it\r\nis this confidence which does the work, and not some mysterious power\r\nissuing from himself.\r\n\r\nWithin the last quarter of a century, in America, several sects of\r\ncurers have appeared under various names and have done notable things in\r\nthe way of healing ailments without the use of medicines. There are the\r\nMind Cure the Faith Cure, the Prayer Cure, the Mental Science Cure, and\r\nthe Christian-Science Cure; and apparently they all do their miracles\r\nwith the same old, powerful instrument--the patient's imagination.\r\nDiffering names, but no difference in the process. But they do not give\r\nthat instrument the credit; each sect claims that its way differs from\r\nthe ways of the others.\r\n\r\nThey all achieve some cures, there is no question about it; and the\r\nFaith Cure and the Prayer Cure probably do no harm when they do no good,\r\nsince they do not forbid the patient to help out the cure with medicines\r\nif he wants to; but the others bar medicines, and claim ability to cure\r\nevery conceivable human ailment through the application of their mental\r\nforces alone. There would seem to be an element of danger here. It has\r\nthe look of claiming too much, I think. Public confidence would probably\r\nbe increased if less were claimed.\r\n\r\nThe Christian Scientist was not able to cure my stomach-ache and my\r\ncold; but the horse-doctor did it. This convinces me that Christian\r\nScience claims too much. In my opinion it ought to let diseases alone\r\nand confine itself to surgery. There it would have everything its own\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe horse-doctor charged me thirty kreutzers, and I paid him; in fact,\r\nI doubled it and gave him a shilling. Mrs. Fuller brought in an itemized\r\nbill for a crate of broken bones mended in two hundred and thirty-four\r\nplaces--one dollar per fracture.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing exists but Mind?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d she answered. \u201cAll else is substanceless, all else is\r\nimaginary.\u201d\r\n\r\nI gave her an imaginary check, and now she is suing me for substantial\r\ndollars. It looks inconsistent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nLet us consider that we are all partially insane. It will explain us to\r\neach other; it will unriddle many riddles; it will make clear and simple\r\nmany things which are involved in haunting and harassing difficulties\r\nand obscurities now.\r\n\r\nThose of us who are not in the asylum, and not demonstrably due there,\r\nare nevertheless, no doubt, insane in one or two particulars. I think\r\nwe must admit this; but I think that we are otherwise healthy-minded.\r\nI think that when we all see one thing alike, it is evidence that, as\r\nregards that one thing, our minds are perfectly sound. Now there are\r\nreally several things which we do all see alike; things which we all\r\naccept, and about which we do not dispute. For instance, we who are\r\noutside of the asylum all agree that water seeks its level; that the\r\nsun gives light and heat; that fire consumes; that fog is damp; that six\r\ntimes six are thirty-six, that two from ten leaves eight; that eight\r\nand seven are fifteen. These are, perhaps, the only things we are agreed\r\nabout; but, although they are so few, they are of inestimable value,\r\nbecause they make an infallible standard of sanity. Whosoever accepts\r\nthem him we know to be substantially sane; sufficiently sane; in the\r\nworking essentials, sane. Whoever disputes a single one of them him we\r\nknow to be wholly insane, and qualified for the asylum.\r\n\r\nVery well, the man who disputes none of them we concede to be entitled\r\nto go at large. But that is concession enough. We cannot go any further\r\nthan that; for we know that in all matters of mere opinion that same man\r\nis insane--just as insane as we are; just as insane as Shakespeare was.\r\nWe know exactly where to put our finger upon his insanity: it is where\r\nhis opinion differs from ours.\r\n\r\nThat is a simple rule, and easy to remember. When I, a thoughtful\r\nand unblessed Presbyterian, examine the Koran, I know that beyond any\r\nquestion every Mohammedan is insane; not in all things, but in religious\r\nmatters. When a thoughtful and unblessed Mohammedan examines the\r\nWestminster Catechism, he knows that beyond any question I am\r\nspiritually insane. I cannot prove to him that he is insane, because\r\nyou never can prove anything to a lunatic--for that is a part of his\r\ninsanity and the evidence of it. He cannot prove to me that I am insane,\r\nfor my mind has the same defect that afflicts his. All Democrats are\r\ninsane, but not one of them knows it; none but the Republicans and\r\nMugwumps know it. All the Republicans are insane, but only the Democrats\r\nand Mugwumps can perceive it. The rule is perfect: in all matters of\r\nopinion our adversaries are insane. When I look around me, I am often\r\ntroubled to see how many people are mad. To mention only a few:\r\n\r\nThe Atheist, The Theosophists, The Infidel, The Swedenborgians, The\r\nAgnostic, The Shakers, The Baptist, The Millerites, The Methodist, The\r\nMormons, The Christian Scientist, The Laurence Oliphant Harrisites, The\r\nCatholic, and the 115 Christian sects, the Presbyterian excepted,\r\nThe Grand Lama's people, The Monarchists, The Imperialists, The 72\r\nMohammedan sects, The Democrats, The Republicans (but not the\r\nMugwumps), The Buddhist, The Blavatsky-Buddhist, The Mind-Curists, The\r\nFaith-Curists, The Nationalist, The Mental Scientists, The Confucian,\r\nThe Spiritualist, The Allopaths, The 2000 East Indian sects, The\r\nHomeopaths, The Electropaths, The Peculiar People, The--\r\n\r\nBut there's no end to the list; there are millions of them! And all\r\ninsane; each in his own way; insane as to his pet fad or opinion,\r\nbut otherwise sane and rational. This should move us to be charitable\r\ntowards one another's lunacies. I recognize that in his special belief\r\nthe Christian Scientist is insane, because he does not believe as I\r\ndo; but I hail him as my mate and fellow, because I am as insane as he\r\ninsane from his point of view, and his point of view is as authoritative\r\nas mine and worth as much. That is to say, worth a brass farthing. Upon\r\na great religious or political question, the opinion of the dullest head\r\nin the world is worth the same as the opinion of the brightest head in\r\nthe world--a brass farthing. How do we arrive at this? It is simple.\r\nThe affirmative opinion of a stupid man is neutralized by the negative\r\nopinion of his stupid neighbor no decision is reached; the affirmative\r\nopinion of the intellectual giant Gladstone is neutralized by the\r\nnegative opinion of the intellectual giant Newman--no decision is\r\nreached. Opinions that prove nothing are, of course, without value any\r\nbut a dead person knows that much. This obliges us to admit the truth\r\nof the unpalatable proposition just mentioned above--that, in disputed\r\nmatters political and religious, one man's opinion is worth no more than\r\nhis peer's, and hence it followers that no man's opinion possesses any\r\nreal value. It is a humbling thought, but there is no way to get around\r\nit: all opinions upon these great subjects are brass-farthing opinions.\r\n\r\nIt is a mere plain, simple fact--as clear and as certain as that eight\r\nand seven make fifteen. And by it we recognize that we are all insane,\r\nas concerns those matters. If we were sane, we should all see a\r\npolitical or religious doctrine alike; there would be no dispute: it\r\nwould be a case of eight and seven--just as it is in heaven, where all\r\nare sane and none insane. There there is but one religion, one belief;\r\nthe harmony is perfect; there is never a discordant note.\r\n\r\nUnder protection of these preliminaries, I suppose I may now repeat\r\nwithout offence that the Christian Scientist is insane. I mean him\r\nno discourtesy, and I am not charging--nor even imagining--that he\r\nis insaner than the rest of the human race. I think he is more\r\npicturesquely insane than some of us. At the same time, I am quite sure\r\nthat in one important and splendid particular he is much saner than is\r\nthe vast bulk of the race.\r\n\r\nWhy is he insane? I told you before: it is because his opinions are not\r\nours. I know of no other reason, and I do not need any other; it is the\r\nonly way we have of discovering insanity when it is not violent. It\r\nis merely the picturesqueness of his insanity that makes it more\r\ninteresting than my kind or yours. For instance, consider his \u201clittle\r\nbook\u201d; the \u201clittle book\u201d exposed in the sky eighteen centuries ago by\r\nthe flaming angel of the Apocalypse, and handed down in our day to Mrs.\r\nMary Baker G. Eddy, of New Hampshire, and translated by her, word for\r\nword, into English (with help of a polisher), and now published and\r\ndistributed in hundreds of editions by her at a clear profit per volume,\r\nabove cost, of seven hundred per cent.!--a profit which distinctly\r\nbelongs to the angel of the Apocalypse, and let him collect it if he\r\ncan; a \u201clittle book\u201d which the C.S. very frequently calls by just that\r\nname, and always enclosed in quotation-marks to keep its high origin\r\nexultantly in mind; a \u201clittle book\u201d which \u201cexplains\u201d and reconstructs\r\nand new-paints and decorates the Bible, and puts a mansard roof on it\r\nand a lightning-rod and all the other modern improvements; a \u201clittle\r\nbook\u201d which for the present affects to travel in yoke with the Bible and\r\nbe friendly to it, and within half a century will hitch the Bible in the\r\nrear and thenceforth travel tandem, itself in the lead, in the coming\r\ngreat march of Christian Scientism through the Protestant dominions of\r\nthe planet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\u201cHungry ones throng to hear the Bible read in connection with the\r\ntext-book of Christian Science, Science and Health, with Key to the\r\nScriptures, by Mary Baker G. Eddy. These are our only preachers. They\r\nare the word of God.\u201d \u201cChristian Science Journal\u201d, October, 1898.\r\n\r\nIs that picturesque? A lady has told me that in a chapel of the Mosque\r\nin Boston there is a picture or image of Mrs. Eddy, and that before it\r\nburns a never-extinguished light. Is that picturesque? How long do you\r\nthink it will be before the Christian Scientist will be worshipping that\r\npicture or image and praying to it? How long do you think it will\r\nbe before it is claimed that Mrs. Eddy is a Redeemer, a Christ, and\r\nChrist's equal? Already her army of disciples speak of her reverently as\r\n\u201cOur Mother.\u201d\r\n\r\nHow long will it be before they place her on the steps of the Throne\r\nbeside the Virgin--and, later, a step higher? First, Mary the Virgin and\r\nMary the Matron; later, with a change of precedence, Mary the Matron\r\nand Mary the Virgin. Let the artist get ready with his canvas and his\r\nbrushes; the new Renaissance is on its way, and there will be money in\r\naltar-canvases--a thousand times as much as the Popes and their Church\r\never spent on the Old Masters; for their riches were poverty as\r\ncompared with what is going to pour into the treasure-chest of the\r\nChristian-Scientist Papacy by-and-by, let us not doubt it. We will\r\nexamine the financial outlook presently and see what it promises. A\r\nfavorite subject of the new Old Master will be the first verse of the\r\ntwelfth chapter of Revelation--a verse which Mrs. Eddy says (in her\r\nAnnex to the Scriptures) has \u201cone distinctive feature which has special\r\nreference to the present age\u201d--and to her, as is rather pointedly\r\nindicated:\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the\r\nsun, and the moon under her feet,\u201d etc.\r\n\r\nThe woman clothed with the sun will be a portrait of Mrs. Eddy.\r\n\r\nIs it insanity to believe that Christian-Scientism is destined to make\r\nthe most formidable show that any new religion has made in the world\r\nsince the birth and spread of Mohammedanism, and that within a century\r\nfrom now it may stand second to Rome only, in numbers and power in\r\nChristendom?\r\n\r\nIf this is a wild dream it will not be easy to prove it so just yet, I\r\nthink. There seems argument that it may come true. The Christian-Science\r\n\u201cboom,\u201d proper, is not yet five years old; yet already it has two\r\nhundred and fifty churches.\r\n\r\nIt has its start, you see, and it is a phenomenally good one. Moreover,\r\nit is latterly spreading with a constantly accelerating swiftness. It\r\nhas a better chance to grow and prosper and achieve permanency than any\r\nother existing \u201cism\u201d; for it has more to offer than any other. The past\r\nteaches us that in order to succeed, a movement like this must not be\r\na mere philosophy, it must be a religion; also, that it must not claim\r\nentire originality, but content itself with passing for an improvement\r\non an existing religion, and show its hand later, when strong and\r\nprosperous--like Mohammedanism.\r\n\r\nNext, there must be money--and plenty of it.\r\n\r\nNext, the power and authority and capital must be concentrated in the\r\ngrip of a small and irresponsible clique, with nobody outside privileged\r\nto ask questions or find fault.\r\n\r\nNext, as before remarked, it must bait its hook with some new and\r\nattractive advantages over the baits offered by its competitors. A new\r\nmovement equipped with some of these endowments--like spiritualism, for\r\ninstance may count upon a considerable success; a new movement equipped\r\nwith the bulk of them--like Mohammedanism, for instance--may count upon\r\na widely extended conquest. Mormonism had all the requisites but one it\r\nhad nothing new and nothing valuable to bait with. Spiritualism lacked\r\nthe important detail of concentration of money and authority in the\r\nhands of an irresponsible clique.\r\n\r\nThe above equipment is excellent, admirable, powerful, but not perfect.\r\nThere is yet another detail which is worth the whole of it put together\r\nand more; a detail which has never been joined (in the beginning of\r\na religious movement) to a supremely good working equipment since the\r\nworld began, until now: a new personage to worship. Christianity had\r\nthe Saviour, but at first and for generations it lacked money and\r\nconcentrated power. In Mrs. Eddy, Christian Science possesses the new\r\npersonage for worship, and in addition--here in the very beginning--a\r\nworking equipment that has not a flaw in it. In the beginning,\r\nMohammedanism had no money; and it has never had anything to offer its\r\nclient but heaven--nothing here below that was valuable. In addition to\r\nheaven hereafter, Christian Science has present health and a cheerful\r\nspirit to offer; and in comparison with this bribe all other this-world\r\nbribes are poor and cheap. You recognize that this estimate is\r\nadmissible, do you not?\r\n\r\nTo whom does Bellamy's \u201cNationalism\u201d appeal? Necessarily to the few:\r\npeople who read and dream, and are compassionate, and troubled for the\r\npoor and the hard-driven. To whom does Spiritualism appeal? Necessarily\r\nto the few; its \u201cboom\u201d has lasted for half a century, and I believe it\r\nclaims short of four millions of adherents in America. Who are attracted\r\nby Swedenborgianism and some of the other fine and delicate \u201cisms\u201d? The\r\nfew again: educated people, sensitively organized, with superior mental\r\nendowments, who seek lofty planes of thought and find their contentment\r\nthere. And who are attracted by Christian Science? There is no limit;\r\nits field is horizonless; its appeal is as universal as is the appeal\r\nof Christianity itself. It appeals to the rich, the poor, the high, the\r\nlow, the cultured, the ignorant, the gifted, the stupid, the modest,\r\nthe vain, the wise, the silly, the soldier, the civilian, the hero, the\r\ncoward, the idler, the worker, the godly, the godless, the freeman, the\r\nslave, the adult, the child; they who are ailing in body or mind,\r\nthey who have friends that are ailing in body or mind. To mass it in a\r\nphrase, its clientage is the Human Race. Will it march? I think so.\r\n\r\nRemember its principal great offer: to rid the Race of pain and disease.\r\nCan it do so? In large measure, yes. How much of the pain and disease in\r\nthe world is created by the imaginations of the sufferers, and then kept\r\nalive by those same imaginations? Four-fifths? Not anything short of\r\nthat, I should think. Can Christian Science banish that four-fifths? I\r\nthink so. Can any other (organized) force do it? None that I know of.\r\nWould this be a new world when that was accomplished? And a pleasanter\r\none--for us well people, as well as for those fussy and fretting sick\r\nones? Would it seem as if there was not as much gloomy weather as there\r\nused to be? I think so.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, would the Scientist kill off a good many patients? I\r\nthink so. More than get killed off now by the legalized methods? I will\r\ntake up that question presently.\r\n\r\nAt present, I wish to ask you to examine some of the Scientist's\r\nperformances, as registered in his magazine, The Christian Science\r\nJournal--October number, 1898. First, a Baptist clergyman gives us this\r\ntrue picture of \u201cthe average orthodox Christian\u201d--and he could have\r\nadded that it is a true picture of the average (civilized) human being:\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is a worried and fretted and fearful man; afraid of himself and his\r\npropensities, afraid of colds and fevers, afraid of treading on serpents\r\nor drinking deadly things.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen he gives us this contrast:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe average Christian Scientist has put all anxiety and fretting under\r\nhis feet. He does have a victory over fear and care that is not achieved\r\nby the average orthodox Christian.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe has put all anxiety and fretting under his feet. What proportion of\r\nyour earnings or income would you be willing to pay for that frame of\r\nmind, year in, year out? It really outvalues any price that can be put\r\nupon it. Where can you purchase it, at any outlay of any sort, in any\r\nChurch or out of it, except the Scientist's?\r\n\r\nWell, it is the anxiety and fretting about colds, and fevers, and\r\ndraughts, and getting our feet wet, and about forbidden food eaten in\r\nterror of indigestion, that brings on the cold and the fever and the\r\nindigestion and the most of our other ailments; and so, if the Science\r\ncan banish that anxiety from the world I think it can reduce the world's\r\ndisease and pain about four-fifths.\r\n\r\nIn this October number many of the redeemed testify and give thanks;\r\nand not coldly, but with passionate gratitude. As a rule they seem\r\ndrunk with health, and with the surprise of it, the wonder of it, the\r\nunspeakable glory and splendor of it, after a long, sober spell spent in\r\ninventing imaginary diseases and concreting them with doctor-stuff.\r\nThe first witness testifies that when \u201cthis most beautiful Truth first\r\ndawned on him\u201d he had \u201cnearly all the ills that flesh is heir to\u201d; that\r\nthose he did not have he thought he had--and this made the tale about\r\ncomplete. What was the natural result? Why, he was a dump-pit \u201cfor all\r\nthe doctors, druggists, and patent medicines of the country.\u201d Christian\r\nScience came to his help, and \u201cthe old sick conditions passed away,\u201d and\r\nalong with them the \u201cdismal forebodings\u201d which he had been accustomed\r\nto employ in conjuring up ailments. And so he was a healthy and cheerful\r\nman, now, and astonished.\r\n\r\nBut I am not astonished, for from other sources I know what must have\r\nbeen his method of applying Christian Science. If I am in the right, he\r\nwatchfully and diligently diverted his mind from unhealthy channels and\r\ncompelled it to travel in healthy ones. Nothing contrivable by human\r\ninvention could be more formidably effective than that, in banishing\r\nimaginary ailments and in closing the entrances against sub-sequent\r\napplicants of their breed. I think his method was to keep saying, \u201cI\r\nam well! I am sound!--sound and well! well and sound! Perfectly sound,\r\nperfectly well! I have no pain; there's no such thing as pain! I have no\r\ndisease; there's no such thing as disease! Nothing is real but Mind; all\r\nis Mind, All-Good Good-Good, Life, Soul, Liver, Bones, one of a series,\r\nante and pass the buck!\u201d\r\n\r\nI do not mean that that was exactly the formula used, but that it\r\ndoubtless contains the spirit of it. The Scientist would attach value to\r\nthe exact formula, no doubt, and to the religious spirit in which it was\r\nused. I should think that any formula that would divert the mind from\r\nunwholesome channels and force it into healthy ones would answer every\r\npurpose with some people, though not with all. I think it most likely\r\nthat a very religious man would find the addition of the religious\r\nspirit a powerful reinforcement in his case.\r\n\r\nThe second witness testifies that the Science banished \u201can old organic\r\ntrouble,\u201d which the doctor and the surgeon had been nursing with drugs\r\nand the knife for seven years.\r\n\r\nHe calls it his \u201cclaim.\u201d A surface-miner would think it was not\r\nhis claim at all, but the property of the doctor and his pal the\r\nsurgeon--for he would be misled by that word, which is Christian-Science\r\nslang for \u201cailment.\u201d The Christian Scientist has no ailment; to him\r\nthere is no such thing, and he will not use the hateful word. All that\r\nhappens to him is that upon his attention an imaginary disturbance\r\nsometimes obtrudes itself which claims to be an ailment but isn't.\r\n\r\nThis witness offers testimony for a clergyman seventy years old who had\r\npreached forty years in a Christian church, and has now gone over to the\r\nnew sect. He was \u201calmost blind and deaf.\u201d He was treated by the C. S.\r\nmethod, and \u201cwhen he heard the voice of Truth he saw spiritually.\u201d Saw\r\nspiritually? It is a little indefinite; they had better treat him again.\r\nIndefinite testimonies might properly be waste-basketed, since there is\r\nevidently no lack of definite ones procurable; but this C. S. magazine\r\nis poorly edited, and so mistakes of this kind must be expected.\r\n\r\nThe next witness is a soldier of the Civil War. When Christian Science\r\nfound him, he had in stock the following claims:\r\n\r\nIndigestion, Rheumatism, Catarrh, Chalky deposits in Shoulder-joints,\r\nArm-joints, Hand-joints, Insomnia, Atrophy of the muscles of Arms.\r\nShoulders, Stiffness of all those joints, Excruciating pains most of the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThese claims have a very substantial sound. They came of exposure in the\r\ncampaigns. The doctors did all they could, but it was little. Prayers\r\nwere tried, but \u201cI never realized any physical relief from that source.\u201d\r\n After thirty years of torture, he went to a Christian Scientist and took\r\nan hour's treatment and went home painless. Two days later, he \u201cbegan\r\nto eat like a well man.\u201d Then \u201cthe claims vanished--some at once, others\r\nmore gradually\u201d; finally, \u201cthey have almost entirely disappeared.\u201d\r\n And--a thing which is of still greater value--he is now \u201ccontented and\r\nhappy.\u201d That is a detail which, as earlier remarked, is a Scientist\r\nChurch specialty. And, indeed, one may go further and assert with\r\nlittle or no exaggeration that it is a Christian-Science monopoly. With\r\nthirty-one years' effort, the Methodist Church had not succeeded in\r\nfurnishing it to this harassed soldier.\r\n\r\nAnd so the tale goes on. Witness after witness bulletins his claims,\r\ndeclares their prompt abolishment, and gives Mrs. Eddy's Discovery the\r\npraise. Milk-leg is cured; nervous prostration is cured; consumption is\r\ncured; and St. Vitus's dance is made a pastime. Even without a fiddle.\r\nAnd now and then an interesting new addition to the Science slang\r\nappears on the page. We have \u201cdemonstrations over chilblains\u201d and such\r\nthings. It seems to be a curtailed way of saying \u201cdemonstrations of\r\nthe power of Christian-Science Truth over the fiction which masquerades\r\nunder the name of Chilblains.\u201d The children, as well as the adults,\r\nshare in the blessings of the Science. \u201cThrough the study of the 'little\r\nbook' they are learning how to be healthful, peaceful, and wise.\u201d\r\n Sometimes they are cured of their little claims by the professional\r\nhealer, and sometimes more advanced children say over the formula and\r\ncure themselves.\r\n\r\nA little Far-Western girl of nine, equipped with an adult vocabulary,\r\nstates her age and says, \u201cI thought I would write a demonstration to\r\nyou.\u201d She had a claim, derived from getting flung over a pony's head and\r\nlanded on a rockpile. She saved herself from disaster by remembering to\r\nsay \u201cGod is All\u201d while she was in the air. I couldn't have done it.\r\nI shouldn't even have thought of it. I should have been too excited.\r\nNothing but Christian Science could have enabled that child to do that\r\ncalm and thoughtful and judicious thing in those circumstances. She came\r\ndown on her head, and by all the rules she should have broken it;\r\nbut the intervention of the formula prevented that, so the only claim\r\nresulting was a blackened eye. Monday morning it was still swollen and\r\nshut. At school \u201cit hurt pretty badly--that is, it seemed to.\u201d So \u201cI was\r\nexcused, and went down to the basement and said, 'Now I am depending on\r\nmamma instead of God, and I will depend on God instead of mamma.'\u201d No\r\ndoubt this would have answered; but, to make sure, she added Mrs. Eddy\r\nto the team and recited \u201cthe Scientific Statement of Being,\u201d which\r\nis one of the principal incantations, I judge. Then \u201cI felt my eye\r\nopening.\u201d Why, dear, it would have opened an oyster. I think it is one\r\nof the touchingest things in child-history, that pious little rat down\r\ncellar pumping away at the Scientific Statement of Being.\r\n\r\nThere is a page about another good child--little Gordon. Little Gordon\r\n\u201ccame into the world without the assistance of surgery or anaesthetics.\u201d\r\n He was a \u201cdemonstration.\u201d A painless one; therefore, his coming evoked\r\n\u201cjoy and thankfulness to God and the Discoverer of Christian Science.\u201d\r\n It is a noticeable feature of this literature--the so frequent linking\r\ntogether of the Two Beings in an equal bond; also of Their Two Bibles.\r\nWhen little Gordon was two years old, \u201che was playing horse on the bed,\r\nwhere I had left my 'little book.' I noticed him stop in his play, take\r\nthe book carefully in his little hands, kiss it softly, then look about\r\nfor the highest place of safety his arms could reach, and put it there.\u201d\r\n This pious act filled the mother \u201cwith such a train of thought as I had\r\nnever experienced before. I thought of the sweet mother of long ago\r\nwho kept things in her heart,\u201d etc. It is a bold comparison; however,\r\nunconscious profanations are about as common in the mouths of the lay\r\nmember ship of the new Church as are frank and open ones in the mouths\r\nof its consecrated chiefs.\r\n\r\nSome days later, the family library--Christian-Science books--was lying\r\nin a deep-seated window. This was another chance for the holy child to\r\nshow off. He left his play and went there and pushed all the books to\r\none side, except the Annex \u201cIt he took in both hands, slowly raised\r\nit to his lips, then removed it carefully, and seated himself in the\r\nwindow.\u201d It had seemed to the mother too wonderful to be true, that\r\nfirst time; but now she was convinced that \u201cneither imagination nor\r\naccident had anything to do with it.\u201d Later, little Gordon let the\r\nauthor of his being see him do it. After that he did it frequently;\r\nprobably every time anybody was looking. I would rather have that child\r\nthan a chromo. If this tale has any object, it is to intimate that the\r\ninspired book was supernaturally able to convey a sense of its sacred\r\nand awful character to this innocent little creature, without\r\nthe intervention of outside aids. The magazine is not edited with\r\nhigh-priced discretion. The editor has a \u201cclaim,\u201d and he ought to get it\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\nAmong other witnesses there is one who had a \u201cjumping toothache,\u201d\r\n which several times tempted her to \u201cbelieve that there was sensation in\r\nmatter, but each time it was overcome by the power of Truth.\u201d She would\r\nnot allow the dentist to use cocaine, but sat there and let him\r\npunch and drill and split and crush the tooth, and tear and slash its\r\nulcerations, and pull out the nerve, and dig out fragments of bone; and\r\nshe wouldn't once confess that it hurt. And to this day she thinks it\r\ndidn't, and I have not a doubt that she is nine-tenths right, and that\r\nher Christian Science faith did her better service than she could have\r\ngotten out of cocaine.\r\n\r\nThere is an account of a boy who got broken all up into small bits by\r\nan accident, but said over the Scientific Statement of Being, or some of\r\nthe other incantations, and got well and sound without having suffered\r\nany real pain and without the intrusion of a surgeon.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is an account of the restoration to perfect health, in\r\na single night, of a fatally injured horse, by the application of\r\nChristian Science. I can stand a good deal, but I recognize that the ice\r\nis getting thin, here. That horse had as many as fifty claims; how\r\ncould he demonstrate over them? Could he do the All-Good, Good-Good,\r\nGood-Gracious, Liver, Bones, Truth, All down but Nine, Set them up on\r\nthe Other Alley? Could he intone the Scientific Statement of Being?\r\nNow, could he? Wouldn't it give him a relapse? Let us draw the line at\r\nhorses. Horses and furniture.\r\n\r\nThere is plenty of other testimonies in the magazine, but these quoted\r\nsamples will answer. They show the kind of trade the Science is driving.\r\nNow we come back to the question, Does the Science kill a patient here\r\nand there and now and then? We must concede it. Does it compensate\r\nfor this? I am persuaded that it can make a plausible showing in that\r\ndirection. For instance: when it lays its hand upon a soldier who has\r\nsuffered thirty years of helpless torture and makes him whole in body\r\nand mind, what is the actual sum of that achievement? This, I think:\r\nthat it has restored to life a subject who had essentially died ten\r\ndeaths a year for thirty years, and each of them a long and painful one.\r\nBut for its interference that man in the three years which have since\r\nelapsed, would have essentially died thirty times more. There are\r\nthousands of young people in the land who are now ready to enter upon a\r\nlife-long death similar to that man's. Every time the Science\r\ncaptures one of these and secures to him life-long immunity from\r\nimagination-manufactured disease, it may plausibly claim that in his\r\nperson it has saved three hundred lives. Meantime, it will kill a man\r\nevery now and then. But no matter, it will still be ahead on the credit\r\nside.\r\n\r\n[NOTE.--I have received several letters (two from educated and\r\nostensibly intelligent persons), which contained, in substance, this\r\nprotest: \u201cI don't object to men and women chancing their lives with\r\nthese people, but it is a burning shame that the law should allow them\r\nto trust their helpless little children in their deadly hands.\u201d Isn't it\r\ntouching? Isn't it deep? Isn't it modest? It is as if the person said:\r\n\u201cI know that to a parent his child is the core of his heart, the apple\r\nof his eye, a possession so dear, so precious that he will trust its\r\nlife in no hands but those which he believes, with all his soul, to be\r\nthe very best and the very safest, but it is a burning shame that the\r\nlaw does not require him to come to me to ask what kind of healer I will\r\nallow him to call.\u201d The public is merely a multiplied \u201cme.\u201d--M.T.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\u201cWe consciously declare that Science and Health, with Key to the\r\nScriptures, was foretold, as well as its author, Mary Baker Eddy, in\r\nRevelation x. She is the 'mighty angel,' or God's highest thought to\r\nthis age (verse 1), giving us the spiritual interpretation of the\r\nBible in the 'little book open' (verse 2). Thus we prove that Christian\r\nScience is the second coming of Christ-Truth-Spirit.\u201d--Lecture by Dr.\r\nGeorge Tomkins, D.D. C.S.\r\n\r\nThere you have it in plain speech. She is the mighty angel; she is the\r\ndivinely and officially sent bearer of God's highest thought. For the\r\npresent, she brings the Second Advent. We must expect that before she\r\nhas been in her grave fifty years she will be regarded by her following\r\nas having been herself the Second Advent. She is already worshiped, and\r\nwe must expect this feeling to spread, territorially, and also to deepen\r\nin intensity.\r\n\r\nParticularly after her death; for then, as any one can foresee,\r\nEddy-Worship will be taught in the Sunday-schools and pulpits of the\r\ncult. Already whatever she puts her trade-mark on, though it be only\r\na memorial-spoon, is holy and is eagerly and gratefully bought by the\r\ndisciple, and becomes a fetish in his house. I say bought, for the\r\nBoston Christian-Science Trust gives nothing away; everything it has\r\nis for sale. And the terms are cash; and not only cash, but cash in\r\nadvance. Its god is Mrs. Eddy first, then the Dollar. Not a spiritual\r\nDollar, but a real one. From end to end of the Christian Science\r\nliterature not a single (material) thing in the world is conceded to be\r\nreal, except the Dollar. But all through and through its advertisements\r\nthat reality is eagerly and persistently recognized.\r\n\r\nThe Dollar is hunted down in all sorts of ways; the Christian-Science\r\nMother-Church and Bargain-Counter in Boston peddles all kinds of\r\nspiritual wares to the faithful, and always on the one condition--cash,\r\ncash in advance. The Angel of the Apocalypse could not go there and get\r\na copy of his own pirated book on credit. Many, many precious Christian\r\nScience things are to be had there for cash: Bible Lessons; Church\r\nManual; C. S. Hymnal; History of the building of the Mother-Church; lot\r\nof Sermons; Communion Hymn, \u201cSaw Ye My Saviour,\u201d by Mrs. Eddy, half a\r\ndollar a copy, \u201cwords used by special permission of Mrs. Eddy.\u201d Also we\r\nhave Mrs. Eddy's and the Angel's little Blue-Annex in eight styles\r\nof binding at eight kinds of war-prices; among these a sweet thing in\r\n\u201clevant, divinity circuit, leather lined to edge, round corners, gold\r\nedge, silk sewed, each, prepaid, $6,\u201d and if you take a million you get\r\nthem a shilling cheaper--that is to say, \u201cprepaid, $5.75.\u201d Also we\r\nhave Mrs. Eddy's Miscellaneous Writings, at 'andsome big prices, the\r\ndivinity-circuit style heading the exertions, shilling discount where\r\nyou take an edition Next comes Christ and Christmas, by the fertile Mrs.\r\nEddy--a poem--would God I could see it!--price $3, cash in advance. Then\r\nfollow five more books by Mrs. Eddy, at highwayman's rates, some of\r\nthem in \u201cleatherette covers,\u201d some of them in \u201cpebble cloth,\u201d with\r\ndivinity-circuit, compensation-balance, twin-screw, and the other modern\r\nimprovements; and at the same bargain-counter can be had The Christian\r\nScience Journal.\r\n\r\nChristian-Science literary discharges are a monopoly of the\r\nMother-Church Headquarters Factory in Boston; none genuine without the\r\ntrade-mark of the Trust. You must apply there and not elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOne hundred dollars for it. And I have a case among my statistics where\r\nthe student had a three weeks' course and paid three hundred for it.\r\n\r\nThe Trust does love the Dollar, when it isn't a spiritual one.\r\n\r\nIn order to force the sale of Mrs Eddy's Bible-Annex, no healer,\r\nMetaphysical-College-bred or other, is allowed to practice the game\r\nunless he possesses a copy of that book. That means a large and\r\nconstantly augmenting income for the Trust. No C.S. family would\r\nconsider itself loyal or pious or pain-proof without an Annex or two in\r\nthe house. That means an income for the Trust, in the near future, of\r\nmillions; not thousands-millions a year.\r\n\r\nNo member, young or old, of a branch Christian-Scientist church can\r\nacquire and retain membership in the Mother-Church unless he pay\r\n\u201ccapitation tax\u201d (of \u201cnot less than a dollar,\u201d say the By-Laws) to the\r\nBoston Trust every year. That means an income for the Trust, in the near\r\nfuture, of--let us venture to say--millions more per year.\r\n\r\nIt is a reasonably safe guess that in America in 1920 there will be ten\r\nmillion Christian Scientists, and three millions in Great Britain;\r\nthat these figures will be trebled in 1930; that in America in 1920\r\nthe Christian Scientists will be a political force, in 1930 politically\r\nformidable, and in 1940 the governing power in the Republic--to remain\r\nthat, permanently. And I think it a reasonable guess that the Trust\r\n(which is already in our day pretty brusque in its ways) will then be\r\nthe most insolent and unscrupulous and tyrannical politico-religious\r\nmaster that has dominated a people since the palmy days of the\r\nInquisition. And a stronger master than the strongest of bygone times,\r\nbecause this one will have a financial strength not dreamed of by any\r\npredecessor; as effective a concentration of irresponsible power as any\r\npredecessor has had; in the railway, the telegraph, and the subsidized\r\nnewspaper, better facilities for watching and managing his empire\r\nthan any predecessor has had; and, after a generation or two, he will\r\nprobably divide Christendom with the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Church has a perfect organization, and it has an effective\r\ncentralization of power--but not of its cash. Its multitude of Bishops\r\nare rich, but their riches remain in large measure in their own hands.\r\nThey collect from two hundred millions of people, but they keep the\r\nbulk of the result at home. The Boston Pope of by-and-by will draw his\r\ndollar-a-head capitation-tax from three hundred millions of the human\r\nrace, and the Annex and the rest of his book-shop stock will fetch in as\r\nmuch more; and his Metaphysical Colleges, the annual Pilgrimage to Mrs.\r\nEddy's tomb, from all over the world-admission, the Christian-Science\r\nDollar (payable in advance)--purchases of consecrated glass beads,\r\ncandles, memorial spoons, aureoled chrome-portraits and bogus autographs\r\nof Mrs. Eddy; cash offerings at her shrine no crutches of cured cripples\r\nreceived, and no imitations of miraculously restored broken legs and\r\nnecks allowed to be hung up except when made out of the Holy Metal\r\nand proved by fire-assay; cash for miracles worked at the tomb: these\r\nmoney-sources, with a thousand to be yet invented and ambushed upon the\r\ndevotee, will bring the annual increment well up above a billion. And\r\nnobody but the Trust will have the handling of it. In that day, the\r\nTrust will monopolize the manufacture and sale of the Old and New\r\nTestaments as well as the Annex, and raise their price to Annex rates,\r\nand compel the devotee to buy (for even to-day a healer has to have the\r\nAnnex and the Scriptures or he is not allowed to work the game), and\r\nthat will bring several hundred million dollars more. In those days, the\r\nTrust will have an income approaching five million dollars a day, and\r\nno expenses to be taken out of it; no taxes to pay, and no charities\r\nto support. That last detail should not be lightly passed over by the\r\nreader; it is well entitled to attention.\r\n\r\nNo charities to support. No, nor even to contribute to. One searches in\r\nvain the Trust's advertisements and the utterances of its organs for\r\nany suggestion that it spends a penny on orphans, widows, discharged\r\nprisoners, hospitals, ragged schools, night missions, city missions,\r\nlibraries, old people's homes, or any other object that appeals to a\r\nhuman being's purse through his heart.\r\n\r\nI have hunted, hunted, and hunted, by correspondence and otherwise, and\r\nhave not yet got upon the track of a farthing that the Trust has spent\r\nupon any worthy object. Nothing makes a Scientist so uncomfortable as to\r\nask him if he knows of a case where Christian Science has spent money\r\non a benevolence, either among its own adherents or elsewhere. He is\r\nobliged to say \u201cNo\u201d And then one discovers that the person questioned\r\nhas been asked the question many times before, and that it is getting to\r\nbe a sore subject with him. Why a sore subject? Because he has written\r\nhis chiefs and asked with high confidence for an answer that will\r\nconfound these questioners--and the chiefs did not reply. He has written\r\nagain, and then again--not with confidence, but humbly, now--and has\r\nbegged for defensive ammunition in the voice of supplication. A reply\r\ndoes at last come to this effect: \u201cWe must have faith in Our Mother, and\r\nrest content in the conviction that whatever She does with the money\r\nit is in accordance with orders from Heaven, for She does no act of any\r\nkind without first 'demonstrating over' it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat settles it--as far as the disciple is concerned. His mind\r\nis satisfied with that answer; he gets down his Annex and does an\r\nincantation or two, and that mesmerizes his spirit and puts that to\r\nsleep--brings it peace. Peace and comfort and joy, until some inquirer\r\npunctures the old sore again.\r\n\r\nThrough friends in America I asked some questions, and in some cases\r\ngot definite and informing answers; in other cases the answers were not\r\ndefinite and not valuable. To the question, \u201cDoes any of the money go to\r\ncharities?\u201d the answer from an authoritative source was: \u201cNo, not in\r\nthe sense usually conveyed by this word.\u201d (The italics are mine.) That\r\nanswer is cautious. But definite, I think--utterly and unassailably\r\ndefinite--although quite Christian-Scientifically foggy in its phrasing.\r\nChristian-Science testimony is generally foggy, generally diffuse,\r\ngenerally garrulous. The writer was aware that the first word in his\r\nphrase answered the question which I was asking, but he could not help\r\nadding nine dark words. Meaningless ones, unless explained by him. It is\r\nquite likely, as intimated by him, that Christian Science has invented\r\na new class of objects to apply the word \u201ccharity\u201d to, but without an\r\nexplanation we cannot know what they are. We quite easily and naturally\r\nand confidently guess that they are in all cases objects which will\r\nreturn five hundred per cent. on the Trust's investment in them,\r\nbut guessing is not knowledge; it is merely, in this case, a sort\r\nof nine-tenths certainty deducible from what we think we know of the\r\nTrust's trade principles and its sly and furtive and shifty ways.\r\n\r\nSly? Deep? Judicious? The Trust understands its business. The Trust does\r\nnot give itself away. It defeats all the attempts of us impertinents to\r\nget at its trade secrets. To this day, after all our diligence, we have\r\nnot been able to get it to confess what it does with the money. It does\r\nnot even let its own disciples find out. All it says is, that the matter\r\nhas been \u201cdemonstrated over.\u201d Now and then a lay Scientist says, with\r\na grateful exultation, that Mrs. Eddy is enormously rich, but he stops\r\nthere; as to whether any of the money goes to other charities or not,\r\nhe is obliged to admit that he does not know. However, the Trust is\r\ncomposed of human beings; and this justifies the conjecture that if it\r\nhad a charity on its list which it was proud of, we should soon hear of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\u201cWithout money and without price.\u201d Those used to be the terms. Mrs.\r\nEddy's Annex cancels them. The motto of Christian Science is, \u201cThe\r\nlaborer is worthy of his hire.\u201d And now that it has been \u201cdemonstrated\r\nover,\u201d we find its spiritual meaning to be, \u201cDo anything and everything\r\nyour hand may find to do; and charge cash for it, and collect the money\r\nin advance.\u201d The Scientist has on his tongue's end a cut-and-dried,\r\nBoston-supplied set of rather lean arguments, whose function is to show\r\nthat it is a Heaven-commanded duty to do this, and that the croupiers of\r\nthe game have no choice but to obey.\r\n\r\nThe Trust seems to be a reincarnation. Exodus xxxii. 4.\r\n\r\nI have no reverence for the Trust, but I am not lacking in reverence for\r\nthe sincerities of the lay membership of the new Church. There is every\r\nevidence that the lay members are entirely sincere in their faith, and\r\nI think sincerity is always entitled to honor and respect, let the\r\ninspiration of the sincerity be what it may. Zeal and sincerity can\r\ncarry a new religion further than any other missionary except fire and\r\nsword, and I believe that the new religion will conquer the half of\r\nChristendom in a hundred years. I am not intending this as a compliment\r\nto the human race; I am merely stating an opinion. And yet I think that\r\nperhaps it is a compliment to the race. I keep in mind that saying of\r\nan orthodox preacher--quoted further back. He conceded that this new\r\nChristianity frees its possessor's life from frets, fears, vexations,\r\nbitterness, and all sorts of imagination-propagated maladies and pains,\r\nand fills his world with sunshine and his heart with gladness. If\r\nChristian Science, with this stupendous equipment--and final salvation\r\nadded--cannot win half the Christian globe, I must be badly mistaken in\r\nthe make-up of the human race.\r\n\r\nI think the Trust will be handed down like the other Papacy, and will\r\nalways know how to handle its limitless cash. It will press the button;\r\nthe zeal, the energy, the sincerity, the enthusiasm of its countless\r\nvassals will do the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nThe power which a man's imagination has over his body to heal it or make\r\nit sick is a force which none of us is born without. The first man had\r\nit, the last one will possess it. If left to himself, a man is most\r\nlikely to use only the mischievous half of the force--the half which\r\ninvents imaginary ailments for him and cultivates them; and if he is\r\none of these--very wise people, he is quite likely to scoff at the\r\nbeneficent half of the force and deny its existence. And so, to heal\r\nor help that man, two imaginations are required: his own and some\r\noutsider's. The outsider, B, must imagine that his incantations are the\r\nhealing-power that is curing A, and A must imagine that this is so. I\r\nthink it is not so, at all; but no matter, the cure is effected, and\r\nthat is the main thing. The outsider's work is unquestionably valuable;\r\nso valuable that it may fairly be likened to the essential work\r\nperformed by the engineer when he handles the throttle and turns on the\r\nsteam; the actual power is lodged exclusively in the engine, but if\r\nthe engine were left alone it would never start of itself. Whether the\r\nengineer be named Jim, or Bob, or Tom, it is all one--his services are\r\nnecessary, and he is entitled to such wage as he can get you to pay.\r\nWhether he be named Christian Scientist, or Mental Scientist, or Mind\r\nCurist, or King's-Evil Expert, or Hypnotist, it is all one; he is merely\r\nthe Engineer; he simply turns on the same old steam and the engine does\r\nthe whole work.\r\n\r\nThe Christian-Scientist engineer drives exactly the same trade as the\r\nother engineers, yet he out-prospers the whole of them put together.\r\n\r\nIs it because he has captured the takingest name? I think that that is\r\nonly a small part of it. I think that the secret of his high prosperity\r\nlies elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe Christian Scientist has organized the business. Now that was\r\ncertainly a gigantic idea. Electricity, in limitless volume, has\r\nexisted in the air and the rocks and the earth and everywhere since\r\ntime began--and was going to waste all the while. In our time we have\r\norganized that scattered and wandering force and set it to work,\r\nand backed the business with capital, and concentrated it in few and\r\ncompetent hands, and the results are as we see.\r\n\r\nThe Christian Scientist has taken a force which has been lying idle in\r\nevery member of the human race since time began, and has organized it,\r\nand backed the business with capital, and concentrated it at Boston\r\nheadquarters in the hands of a small and very competent Trust, and there\r\nare results.\r\n\r\nTherein lies the promise that this monopoly is going to extend its\r\ncommerce wide in the earth. I think that if the business were conducted\r\nin the loose and disconnected fashion customary with such things, it\r\nwould achieve but little more than the modest prosperity usually secured\r\nby unorganized great moral and commercial ventures; but I believe that\r\nso long as this one remains compactly organized and closely concentrated\r\nin a Trust, the spread of its dominion will continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nFour years ago I wrote the preceding chapters. I was assured by the wise\r\nthat Christian Science was a fleeting craze and would soon perish. This\r\nprompt and all-competent stripe of prophet is always to be had in the\r\nmarket at ground-floor rates. He does not stop to load, or consider, or\r\ntake aim, but lets fly just as he stands. Facts are nothing to him, he\r\nhas no use for such things; he works wholly by inspiration. And so, when\r\nhe is asked why he considers a new movement a passing fad and quickly\r\nperishable, he finds himself unprepared with a reason and is more or\r\nless embarrassed. For a moment. Only for a moment. Then he waylays the\r\nfirst spectre of a reason that goes flitting through the desert places\r\nof his mind, and is at once serene again and ready for conflict. Serene\r\nand confident. Yet he should not be so, since he has had no chance\r\nto examine his catch, and cannot know whether it is going to help his\r\ncontention or damage it.\r\n\r\nThe impromptu reason furnished by the early prophets of whom I have\r\nspoken was this:\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is nothing to Christian Science; there is nothing about it\r\nthat appeals to the intellect; its market will be restricted to the\r\nunintelligent, the mentally inferior, the people who do not think.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey called that a reason why the cult would not flourish and endure. It\r\nseems the equivalent of saying:\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no money in tinware; there is nothing about it that appeals to\r\nthe rich; its market will be restricted to the poor.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt is like bringing forward the best reason in the world why Christian\r\nScience should flourish and live, and then blandly offering it as a\r\nreason why it should sicken and die.\r\n\r\nThat reason was furnished me by the complacent and unfrightened\r\nprophets four years ago, and it has been furnished me again to-day. If\r\nconversions to new religions or to old ones were in any considerable\r\ndegree achieved through the intellect, the aforesaid reason would be\r\nsound and sufficient, no doubt; the inquirer into Christian Science\r\nmight go away unconvinced and unconverted. But we all know that\r\nconversions are seldom made in that way; that such a thing as a serious\r\nand painstaking and fairly competent inquiry into the claims of a\r\nreligion or of a political dogma is a rare occurrence; and that the\r\nvast mass of men and women are far from being capable of making such\r\nan examination. They are not capable, for the reason that their minds,\r\nhowsoever good they may be, are not trained for such examinations. The\r\nmind not trained for that work is no more competent to do it than\r\nare lawyers and farmers competent to make successful clothes without\r\nlearning the tailor's trade. There are seventy-five million men and\r\nwomen among us who do not know how to cut out and make a dress-suit, and\r\nthey would not think of trying; yet they all think they can competently\r\nthink out a political or religious scheme without any apprenticeship to\r\nthe business, and many of them believe they have actually worked that\r\nmiracle. But, indeed, the truth is, almost all the men and women of our\r\nnation or of any other get their religion and their politics where they\r\nget their astronomy--entirely at second hand. Being untrained, they are\r\nno more able to intelligently examine a dogma or a policy than they are\r\nto calculate an eclipse.\r\n\r\nMen are usually competent thinkers along the lines of their specialized\r\ntraining only. Within these limits alone are their opinions and\r\njudgments valuable; outside of these limits they grope and are\r\nlost--usually without knowing it. In a church assemblage of five hundred\r\npersons, there will be a man or two whose trained minds can seize upon\r\neach detail of a great manufacturing scheme and recognize its value\r\nor its lack of value promptly; and can pass the details in intelligent\r\nreview, section by section, and finally as a whole, and then deliver a\r\nverdict upon the scheme which cannot be flippantly set aside nor easily\r\nanswered. And there will be one or two other men there who can do the\r\nsame thing with a great and complicated educational project; and one\r\nor two others who can do the like with a large scheme for applying\r\nelectricity in a new and unheard-of way; and one or two others who can\r\ndo it with a showy scheme for revolutionizing the scientific world's\r\naccepted notions regarding geology. And so on, and so on. But the\r\nmanufacturing experts will not be competent to examine the educational\r\nscheme intelligently, and their opinion about it would not be valuable;\r\nneither of these two groups will be able to understand and pass upon the\r\nelectrical scheme; none of these three batches of experts will be able\r\nto understand and pass upon the geological revolution; and probably not\r\none man in the entire lot will be competent to examine, capably, the\r\nintricacies of a political or religious scheme, new or old, and deliver\r\na judgment upon it which any one need regard as precious.\r\n\r\nThere you have the top crust. There will be four hundred and\r\nseventy-five men and women present who can draw upon their training and\r\ndeliver incontrovertible judgments concerning cheese, and leather,\r\nand cattle, and hardware, and soap, and tar, and candles, and patent\r\nmedicines, and dreams, and apparitions, and garden trucks, and cats, and\r\nbaby food, and warts, and hymns, and time-tables, and freight-rates, and\r\nsummer resorts, and whiskey, and law, and surgery, and dentistry, and\r\nblacksmithing, and shoemaking, and dancing, and Huyler's candy, and\r\nmathematics, and dog fights, and obstetrics, and music, and sausages,\r\nand dry goods, and molasses, and railroad stocks, and horses, and\r\nliterature, and labor unions, and vegetables, and morals, and lamb's\r\nfries, and etiquette, and agriculture. And not ten among the five\r\nhundred--let their minds be ever so good and bright--will be competent,\r\nby grace of the requisite specialized mental training, to take hold of a\r\ncomplex abstraction of any kind and make head or tail of it.\r\n\r\nThe whole five hundred are thinkers, and they are all capable\r\nthinkers--but only within the narrow limits of their specialized\r\ntrainings. Four hundred and ninety of them cannot competently examine\r\neither a religious plan or a political one. A scattering few of them do\r\nexamine both--that is, they think they do. With results as precious as\r\nwhen I examine the nebular theory and explain it to myself.\r\n\r\nIf the four hundred and ninety got their religion through their minds,\r\nand by weighed and measured detail, Christian Science would not be a\r\nscary apparition. But they don't; they get a little of it through their\r\nminds, more of it through their feelings, and the overwhelming bulk of\r\nit through their environment.\r\n\r\nEnvironment is the chief thing to be considered when one is proposing to\r\npredict the future of Christian Science. It is not the ability to reason\r\nthat makes the Presbyterian, or the Baptist, or the Methodist, or the\r\nCatholic, or the Mohammedan, or the Buddhist, or the Mormon; it is\r\nenvironment. If religions were got by reasoning, we should have the\r\nextraordinary spectacle of an American family with a Presbyterian in it,\r\nand a Baptist, a Methodist, a Catholic, a Mohammedan, a Buddhist, and\r\na Mormon. A Presbyterian family does not produce Catholic families\r\nor other religious brands, it produces its own kind; and not\r\nby intellectual processes, but by association. And so also with\r\nMohammedanism, the cult which in our day is spreading with the sweep of\r\na world-conflagration through the Orient, that native home of profound\r\nthought and of subtle intellectual fence, that fertile womb whence has\r\nsprung every great religion that exists. Including our own; for with all\r\nour brains we cannot invent a religion and market it.\r\n\r\nThe language of my quoted prophets recurs to us now, and we wonder to\r\nthink how small a space in the world the mighty Mohammedan Church would\r\nbe occupying now, if a successful trade in its line of goods had been\r\nconditioned upon an exhibit that would \u201cappeal to the intellect\u201d instead\r\nof to \u201cthe unintelligent, the mentally inferior, the people who do not\r\nthink.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Christian Science Church, like the Mohammedan Church, makes no\r\nembarrassing appeal to the intellect, has no occasion to do it, and can\r\nget along quite well without it.\r\n\r\nProvided. Provided what? That it can secure that thing which is\r\nworth two or three hundred thousand times more than an \u201cappeal to the\r\nintellect\u201d--an environment. Can it get that? Will it be a menace\r\nto regular Christianity if it gets that? Is it time for regular\r\nChristianity to get alarmed? Or shall regular Christianity smile a smile\r\nand turn over and take another nap? Won't it be wise and proper for\r\nregular Christianity to do the old way, Me customary way, the historical\r\nway--lock the stable-door after the horse is gone? Just as Protestantism\r\nhas smiled and nodded this long time (while the alert and diligent\r\nCatholic was slipping in and capturing the public schools), and is now\r\nbeginning to hunt around for the key when it is too late?\r\n\r\nWill Christian Science get a chance to show its wares? It has already\r\nsecured that chance. Will it flourish and spread and prosper if it\r\nshall create for itself the one thing essential to those conditions--an\r\nenvironment? It has already created an environment. There are families\r\nof Christian Scientists in every community in America, and each family\r\nis a factory; each family turns out a Christian Science product at the\r\ncustomary intervals, and contributes it to the Cause in the only way\r\nin which contributions of recruits to Churches are ever made on a large\r\nscale--by the puissant forces of personal contact and association.\r\nEach family is an agency for the Cause, and makes converts among the\r\nneighbors, and starts some more factories.\r\n\r\nFour years ago there were six Christian Scientists in a certain town\r\nthat I am acquainted with; a year ago there were two hundred and fifty\r\nthere; they have built a church, and its membership now numbers four\r\nhundred. This has all been quietly done; done without frenzied revivals,\r\nwithout uniforms, brass bands, street parades, corner oratory, or any of\r\nthe other customary persuasions to a godly life. Christian Science, like\r\nMohammedanism, is \u201crestricted\u201d to the \u201cunintelligent, the people who\r\ndo not think.\u201d There lies the danger. It makes Christian Science\r\nformidable. It is \u201crestricted\u201d to ninety-nine one-hundredths of the\r\nhuman race, and must be reckoned with by regular Christianity. And will\r\nbe, as soon as it is too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were remarkable things about the stranger called the\r\nMan--Mystery-things so very extraordinary that they monopolized\r\nattention and made all of him seem extraordinary; but this was not so,\r\nthe most of his qualities being of the common, every-day size and like\r\nanybody else's. It was curious. He was of the ordinary stature, and had\r\nthe ordinary aspects; yet in him were hidden such strange contradictions\r\nand disproportions! He was majestically fearless and heroic; he had\r\nthe strength of thirty men and the daring of thirty thousand; handling\r\narmies, organizing states, administering governments--these were\r\npastimes to him; he publicly and ostentatiously accepted the human race\r\nat its own valuation--as demigods--and privately and successfully dealt\r\nwith it at quite another and juster valuation--as children and slaves;\r\nhis ambitions were stupendous, and his dreams had no commerce with the\r\nhumble plain, but moved with the cloud-rack among the snow-summits.\r\nThese features of him were, indeed, extraordinary, but the rest of\r\nhim was ordinary and usual. He was so mean-minded, in the matter of\r\njealousy, that it was thought he was descended from a god; he was vain\r\nin little ways, and had a pride in trivialities; he doted on ballads\r\nabout moonshine and bruised hearts; in education he was deficient, he\r\nwas indifferent to literature, and knew nothing of art; he was dumb upon\r\nall subjects but one, indifferent to all except that one--the Nebular\r\nTheory. Upon that one his flow of words was full and free, he was a\r\ngeyser. The official astronomers disputed his facts and deeded his\r\nviews, and said that he had invented both, they not being findable in\r\nany of the books. But many of the laity, who wanted their nebulosities\r\nfresh, admired his doctrine and adopted it, and it attained to great\r\nprosperity in spite of the hostility of the experts.\u201d--The Legend of the\r\nMan-Mystery, ch. i.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nJANUARY, 1903. When we do not know a public man personally, we guess him\r\nout by the facts of his career. When it is Washington, we all arrive\r\nat about one and the same result. We agree that his words and his acts\r\nclearly interpret his character to us, and that they never leave us in\r\ndoubt as to the motives whence the words and acts proceeded. It is the\r\nsame with Joan of Arc, it is the same with two or three or five or six\r\nothers among the immortals. But in the matter of motives and of a few\r\ndetails of character we agree to disagree upon Napoleon, Cromwell, and\r\nall the rest; and to this list we must add Mrs. Eddy. I think we can\r\npeacefully agree as to two or three extraordinary features of her\r\nmake-up, but not upon the other features of it. We cannot peacefully\r\nagree as to her motives, therefore her character must remain crooked to\r\nsome of us and straight to the others.\r\n\r\nNo matter, she is interesting enough without an amicable agreement. In\r\nseveral ways she is the most interesting woman that ever lived, and the\r\nmost extraordinary. The same may be said of her career, and the same\r\nmay be said of its chief result. She started from nothing. Her enemies\r\ncharge that she surreptitiously took from Quimby a peculiar system of\r\nhealing which was mind-cure with a Biblical basis. She and her friends\r\ndeny that she took anything from him. This is a matter which we\r\ncan discuss by-and-by. Whether she took it or invented it, it\r\nwas--materially--a sawdust mine when she got it, and she has turned it\r\ninto a Klondike; its spiritual dock had next to no custom, if any at\r\nall: from it she has launched a world-religion which has now six hundred\r\nand sixty-three churches, and she charters a new one every four days.\r\nWhen we do not know a person--and also when we do--we have to judge his\r\nsize by the size and nature of his achievements, as compared with the\r\nachievements of others in his special line of business--there is no\r\nother way. Measured by this standard, it is thirteen hundred years\r\nsince the world has produced any one who could reach up to Mrs. Eddy's\r\nwaistbelt.\r\n\r\nFiguratively speaking, Mrs. Eddy is already as tall as the Eiffel tower.\r\nShe is adding surprisingly to her stature every day. It is quite within\r\nthe probabilities that a century hence she will be the most imposing\r\nfigure that has cast its shadow across the globe since the inauguration\r\nof our era. I grant that after saying these strong things, it is\r\nnecessary that I offer some details calculated to satisfactorily\r\ndemonstrate the proportions which I have claimed for her. I will do that\r\npresently; but before exhibiting the matured sequoia gigantea, I believe\r\nit will be best to exhibit the sprout from which it sprang. It may save\r\nthe reader from making miscalculations. The person who imagines that a\r\nBig Tree sprout is bigger than other kinds of sprouts is quite mistaken.\r\nIt is the ordinary thing; it makes no show, it compels no notice, it\r\nhasn't a detectible quality in it that entitles it to attention, or\r\nsuggests the future giant its sap is suckling. That is the kind of\r\nsprout Mrs. Eddy was.\r\n\r\nFrom her childhood days up to where she was running a half-century a\r\nclose race and gaining on it, she was most humanly commonplace.\r\n\r\nShe is the witness I am drawing this from. She has revealed it in her\r\nautobiography not intentionally, of course--I am not claiming that. An\r\nautobiography is the most treacherous thing there is. It lets out\r\nevery secret its author is trying to keep; it lets the truth shine\r\nunobstructed through every harmless little deception he tries to play;\r\nit pitilessly exposes him as a tin hero worshipping himself as Big Metal\r\nevery time he tries to do the modest-unconsciousness act before the\r\nreader. This is not guessing; I am speaking from autobiographical\r\npersonal experience; I was never able to refrain from mentioning, with\r\na studied casualness that could deceive none but the most incautious\r\nreader, that an ancestor of mine was sent ambassador to Spain by Charles\r\nI., nor that in a remote branch of my family there exists a claimant\r\nto an earldom, nor that an uncle of mine used to own a dog that was\r\ndescended from the dog that was in the Ark; and at the same time I was\r\nnever able to persuade myself to call a gibbet by its right name when\r\naccounting for other ancestors of mine, but always spoke of it as the\r\n\u201cplatform\u201d--puerilely intimating that they were out lecturing when it\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nIt is Mrs. Eddy over again. As regards her minor half, she is as\r\ncommonplace as the rest of us. Vain of trivial things all the first half\r\nof her life, and still vain of them at seventy and recording them with\r\nnaive satisfaction--even rescuing some early rhymes of hers of the sort\r\nthat we all scribble in the innocent days of our youth--rescuing them\r\nand printing them without pity or apology, just as the weakest and\r\ncommonest of us do in our gray age. More--she still frankly admires\r\nthem; and in her introduction of them profanely confers upon them the\r\nholy name of \u201cpoetry.\u201d Sample:\r\n\r\n     \u201cAnd laud the land whose talents rock\r\n     The cradle of her power,\r\n     And wreaths are twined round Plymouth Rock\r\n     From erudition's bower.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \u201cMinerva's silver sandals still\r\n     Are loosed and not effete.\u201d\r\n\r\nYou note it is not a shade above the thing which all human beings churn\r\nout in their youth.\r\n\r\nYou would not think that in a little wee primer--for that is what the\r\nAutobiography is--a person with a tumultuous career of seventy years\r\nbehind her could find room for two or three pages of padding of this\r\nkind, but such is the case. She evidently puts narrative together with\r\ndifficulty and is not at home in it, and is glad to have something\r\nready-made to fill in with. Another sample:\r\n\r\n     \u201cHere fame-honored Hickory rears his bold form,\r\n     And bears a brave breast to the lightning and storm,\r\n     While Palm, Bay, and Laurel in classical glee,\r\n     Chase Tulip, Magnolia, and fragrant Fringe-tree.\u201d\r\n\r\nVivid? You can fairly see those trees galloping around. That she\r\ncould still treasure up, and print, and manifestly admire those Poems,\r\nindicates that the most daring and masculine and masterful woman that\r\nhas appeared in the earth in centuries has the same soft, girly-girly\r\nplaces in her that the rest of us have.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to selecting her ancestors she is still human, natural,\r\nvain, commonplace--as commonplace as I am myself when I am sorting\r\nancestors for my autobiography. She combs out some creditable Scots, and\r\nlabels them and sets them aside for use, not overlooking the one to whom\r\nSir William Wallace gave \u201ca heavy sword encased in a brass scabbard,\u201d\r\n and naively explaining which Sir William Wallace it was, lest we get\r\nthe wrong one by the hassock; this is the one \u201cfrom whose patriotism\r\nand bravery comes that heart-stirring air, 'Scots wha hae wi' Wallace\r\nbled.'\u201d Hannah More was related to her ancestors. She explains who\r\nHannah More was.\r\n\r\nWhenever a person informs us who Sir William Wallace was, or who wrote\r\n\u201cHamlet,\u201d or where the Declaration of Independence was fought, it fills\r\nus with a suspicion wellnigh amounting to conviction, that that person\r\nwould not suspect us of being so empty of knowledge if he wasn't\r\nsuffering from the same \u201cclaim\u201d himself. Then we turn to page 20 of the\r\nAutobiography and happen upon this passage, and that hasty suspicion\r\nstands rebuked:\r\n\r\n\u201cI gained book-knowledge with far less labor than is usually requisite.\r\nAt ten years of age I was as familiar with Lindley Murray's Grammar as\r\nwith the Westminster Catechism; and the latter I had to repeat every\r\nSunday. My favorite studies were Natural Philosophy, Logic, and Moral\r\nScience. From my brother Albert I received lessons in the ancient\r\ntongues, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.\u201d\r\n\r\nYou catch your breath in astonishment, and feel again and still again\r\nthe pang of that rebuke. But then your eye falls upon the next sentence\r\nbut one, and the pain passes away and you set up the suspicion again\r\nwith evil satisfaction:\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter my discovery of Christian Science, most of the knowledge I had\r\ngleaned from school-books vanished like a dream.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat disappearance accounts for much in her miscellaneous writings. As I\r\nwas saying, she handles her \u201cancestral shadows,\u201d as she calls them, just\r\nas I do mine. It is remarkable. When she runs across \u201ca relative of my\r\nGrandfather Baker, General Henry Knox, of Revolutionary fame,\u201d she sets\r\nhim down; when she finds another good one, \u201cthe late Sir John Macneill,\r\nin the line of my Grandfather Baker's family,\u201d she sets him down, and\r\nremembers that he \u201cwas prominent in British politics, and at one time\r\nheld the position of ambassador to Persia\u201d; when she discovers that her\r\ngrandparents \u201cwere likewise connected with Captain John Lovewell, whose\r\ngallant leadership and death in the Indian troubles of 1722-25 caused\r\nthat prolonged contest to be known historically as Lovewell's War,\u201d\r\n she sets the Captain down; when it turns out that a cousin of her\r\ngrandmother \u201cwas John Macneill, the New Hampshire general, who fought at\r\nLundy's Lane and won distinction in 1814 at the battle of Chippewa,\u201d\r\n she catalogues the General. (And tells where Chippewa was.) And then she\r\nskips all her platform people; never mentions one of them. It shows that\r\nshe is just as human as any of us.\r\n\r\nYet, after all, there is something very touching in her pride in these\r\nworthy small-fry, and something large and fine in her modesty in not\r\ncaring to remember that their kinship to her can confer no distinction\r\nupon her, whereas her mere mention of their names has conferred upon\r\nthem a faceless earthly immortality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nWhen she wrote this little biography her great life-work had already\r\nbeen achieved, she was become renowned; to multitudes of reverent\r\ndisciples she was a sacred personage, a familiar of God, and His\r\ninspired channel of communication with the human race. Also, to them\r\nthese following things were facts, and not doubted:\r\n\r\nShe had written a Bible in middle age, and had published it; she had\r\nrecast it, enlarged it, and published it again; she had not stopped\r\nthere, but had enlarged it further, polished its phrasing, improved\r\nits form, and published it yet again. It was at last become a compact,\r\ngrammatical, dignified, and workman-like body of literature. This was\r\ngood training, persistent training; and in all arts it is training that\r\nbrings the art to perfection. We are now confronted with one of the most\r\nteasing and baffling riddles of Mrs. Eddy's history--a riddle which may\r\nbe formulated thus:\r\n\r\nHow is it that a primitive literary gun which began as a hundred-yard\r\nflint-lock smooth-bore muzzle-loader, and in the course of forty years\r\nhas acquired one notable improvement after another--percussion cap;\r\nfixed cartridge; rifled barrel; efficiency at half a mile how is it that\r\nsuch a gun, sufficiently good on an elephant hunt (Christian Science)\r\nfrom the beginning, and growing better and better all the time during\r\nforty years, has always collapsed back to its original flint-lock\r\nestate the moment the huntress trained it on any other creature than an\r\nelephant?\r\n\r\nSomething more than a generation ago Mrs. Eddy went out with her\r\nflint-lock on the rabbit range; and this was a part of the result:\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter his decease, and a severe casualty deemed fatal by skilful\r\nphysicians, we discovered that the Principle of all healing and the law\r\nthat governs it is God, a divine Principle, and a spiritual not material\r\nlaw, and regained health.\u201d--Preface to Science and Health, first\r\nrevision, 1883.\r\n\r\nN.B. Not from the book itself; from the Preface.\r\n\r\nYou will notice the awkwardness of that English. If you should carry\r\nthat paragraph up to the Supreme Court of the United States in order\r\nto find out for good and all whether the fatal casualty happened to the\r\ndead man--as the paragraph almost asserts--or to some person or persons\r\nnot even hinted at in the paragraph, the Supreme Court would be obliged\r\nto say that the evidence established nothing with certainty except that\r\nthere had been a casualty--victim not known.\r\n\r\nThe context thinks it explains who the victim was, but it does nothing\r\nof the kind. It furnishes some guessing-material of a sort which enables\r\nyou to infer that it was \u201cwe\u201d that suffered the mentioned injury, but if\r\nyou should carry the language to a court you would not be able to prove\r\nthat it necessarily meant that. \u201cWe\u201d are Mrs. Eddy; a funny little\r\naffectation. She replaced it later with the more dignified third person.\r\n\r\nThe quoted paragraph is from Mrs. Eddy's preface to the first revision\r\nof Science and Health (1883). Sixty-four pages further along--in the\r\nbody of the book (the elephant-range), she went out with that same\r\nflint-lock and got this following result. Its English is very nearly\r\nas straight and clean and competent as is the English of the latest\r\nrevision of Science and Health after the gun has been improved from\r\nsmooth-bore musket up to globe-sighted, long distance rifle:\r\n\r\n\u201cMan controlled by his Maker has no physical suffering. His body is\r\nharmonious, his days are multiplying instead of diminishing, he is\r\njourneying towards Life instead of death, and bringing out the new man\r\nand crucifying the old affections, cutting them off in every material\r\ndirection until he learns the utter supremacy of Spirit and yields\r\nobedience thereto.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the latest revision of Science and Health (1902), the perfected\r\ngun furnishes the following. The English is clean, compact, dignified,\r\nalmost perfect. But it is observable that it is not prominently better\r\nthan it is in the above paragraph, which was a product of the primitive\r\nflint-lock:\r\n\r\n\u201cHow unreasonable is the belief that we are wearing out life and\r\nhastening to death, and at the same time we are communing with\r\nimmortality? If the departed are in rapport with mortality, or matter,\r\nthey are not spiritual, but must still be mortal, sinful, suffering,\r\nand dying. Then wherefore look to them--even were communication\r\npossible--for proofs of immortality and accept them as oracles?\u201d\r\n --Edition of 1902, page 78.\r\n\r\nWith the above paragraphs compare these that follow. It is Mrs. Eddy\r\nwriting--after a good long twenty years of pen-practice. Compare also\r\nwith the alleged Poems already quoted. The prominent characteristic of\r\nthe Poems is affectation, artificiality; their makeup is a complacent\r\nand pretentious outpour of false figures and fine writing, in the\r\nsophomoric style. The same qualities and the same style will be found,\r\nunchanged, unbettered, in these following paragraphs--after a lapse of\r\nmore than fifty years, and after--as aforesaid--long literary training.\r\nThe italics are mine:\r\n\r\n1. \u201cWhat plague spot or bacilli were [sic] gnawing [sic] at the heart of\r\nthis metropolis... and bringing it [the heart] on bended knee? Why, it\r\nwas an institute that had entered its vitals--that, among other things,\r\ntaught games,\u201d et cetera.--C.S. Journal, p. 670, article entitled \u201cA\r\nNarrative--by Mary Baker G. Eddy.\u201d\r\n\r\n2. \u201cParks sprang up [sic]... electric-cars run [sic] merrily through\r\nseveral streets, concrete sidewalks and macadamized roads dotted [sic]\r\nthe place,\u201d et cetera.--Ibid.\r\n\r\n3. \u201cShorn [sic] of its suburbs it had indeed little left to admire, save\r\nto [sic] such as fancy a skeleton above ground breathing [sic] slowly\r\nthrough a barren [sic] breast.\u201d--Ibid.\r\n\r\nThis is not English--I mean, grown-up English. But it is\r\nfifteen-year-old English, and has not grown a month since the same\r\nmind produced the Poems. The standard of the Poems and of the\r\nplague-spot-and-bacilli effort is exactly the same. It is most strange\r\nthat the same intellect that worded the simple and self-contained and\r\nclean-cut paragraph beginning with \u201cHow unreasonable is the belief,\u201d\r\n should in the very same lustrum discharge upon the world such a verbal\r\nchaos as the utterance concerning that plague-spot or bacilli which\r\nwere gnawing at the insides of the metropolis and bringing its heart on\r\nbended knee, thus exposing to the eye the rest of the skeleton breathing\r\nslowly through a barren breast.\r\n\r\nThe immense contrast between the legitimate English of Science and\r\nHealth and the bastard English of Mrs. Eddy's miscellaneous work, and\r\nbetween the maturity of the one diction and the juvenility of the other,\r\nsuggests--compels--the question, Are there two guns? It would seem so.\r\nIs there a poor, foolish, old, scattering flint-lock for rabbit, and a\r\nlong-range, centre-driving, up-to-date Mauser-magazine for elephant?\r\nIt looks like it. For it is observable that in Science and Health (the\r\nelephant-ground) the practice was good at the start and has remained so,\r\nand that the practice in the miscellaneous, outside, small-game field\r\nwas very bad at the start and was never less bad at any later time.\r\n\r\nI wish to say that of Mrs. Eddy I am not requiring perfect English,\r\nbut only good English. No one can write perfect English and keep it\r\nup through a stretch of ten chapters. It has never been done. It was\r\napproached in the \u201cwell of English undefiled\u201d; it has been approached\r\nin Mrs. Eddy's Annex to that Book; it has been approached in several\r\nEnglish grammars; I have even approached it myself; but none of us has\r\nmade port.\r\n\r\nNow, the English of Science and Health is good. In passages to be found\r\nin Mrs. Eddy's Autobiography (on pages 53, 57, 101, and 113), and on\r\npage 6 of her squalid preface to Science and Health, first revision, she\r\nseems to me to claim the whole and sole authorship of the book. That\r\nshe wrote the Autobiography, and that preface, and the Poems, and the\r\nPlague-spot-Bacilli, we are not permitted to doubt. Indeed, we know she\r\nwrote them. But the very certainty that she wrote these things compels\r\na doubt that she wrote Science and Health. She is guilty of little\r\nawkwardnesses of expression in the Autobiography which a practiced pen\r\nwould hardly allow to go uncorrected in even a hasty private letter,\r\nand could not dream of passing by uncorrected in passages intended for\r\nprint. But she passes them placidly by; as placidly as if she did not\r\nsuspect that they were offenses against third-class English. I think\r\nthat that placidity was born of that very unawareness, so to speak. I\r\nwill cite a few instances from the Autobiography. The italics are mine:\r\n\r\n\u201cI remember reading in my childhood certain manuscripts containing\r\nScriptural Sonnets, besides other verses and enigmas,\u201d etc. Page 7.\r\n\r\n[On page 27.] \u201cMany pale cripples went into the Church leaning on\r\ncrutches who came out carrying them on their shoulders.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt is awkward, because at the first glance it seems to say that the\r\ncripples went in leaning on crutches which went out carrying the\r\ncripples on their shoulders. It would have cost her no trouble to\r\nput her \u201cwho\u201d after her \u201ccripples.\u201d I blame her a little; I think her\r\nproof-reader should have been shot. We may let her capital C pass, but\r\nit is another awkwardness, for she is talking about a building, not\r\nabout a religious society.\r\n\r\n\u201cMarriage and Parentage\u201d [Chapter-heading. Page 30]. You imagine that\r\nshe is going to begin a talk about her marriage and finish with\r\nsome account of her father and mother. And so you will be deceived.\r\n\u201cMarriage\u201d was right, but \u201cParentage\u201d was not the best word for the rest\r\nof the record. It refers to the birth of her own child. After a certain\r\nperiod of time \u201cmy babe was born.\u201d Marriage and Motherhood--Marriage and\r\nMaternity--Marriage and Product--Marriage and Dividend--either of these\r\nwould have fitted the facts and made the matter clear.\r\n\r\n\u201cWithout my knowledge he was appointed a guardian.\u201d Page 32.\r\n\r\nShe is speaking of her child. She means that a guardian for her child\r\nwas appointed, but that isn't what she says.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf spiritual conclusions are separated from their premises, the\r\nnexus is lost, and the argument with its rightful conclusions, becomes\r\ncorrespondingly obscure.\u201d Page 34.\r\n\r\nWe shall never know why she put the word \u201ccorrespondingly\u201d in\r\nthere. Any fine, large word would have answered just as well:\r\npsychosuperintangibly--electroincandescently--oligarcheologically--\r\nsanchrosynchro-stereoptically--any of these would have answered,\r\nany of these would have filled the void.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis spiritual noumenon and phenomenon silenced portraiture.\u201d Page 34.\r\n\r\nYet she says she forgot everything she knew, when she discovered\r\nChristian Science. I realize that noumenon is a daisy; and I will not\r\ndeny that I shall use it whenever I am in a company which I think I can\r\nembarrass with it; but, at the same time, I think it is out of place\r\namong friends in an autobiography. There, I think a person ought not\r\nto have anything up his sleeve. It undermines confidence. But my\r\ndissatisfaction with the quoted passage is not on account of noumenon;\r\nit is on account of the misuse of the word \u201csilenced.\u201d You cannot\r\nsilence portraiture with a noumenon; if portraiture should make a noise,\r\na way could be found to silence it, but even then it could not be done\r\nwith a noumenon. Not even with a brick, some authorities think.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may be that the mortal life-battle still wages,\u201d etc. Page 35.\r\n\r\nThat is clumsy. Battles do not wage, battles are waged. Mrs. Eddy has\r\none very curious and interesting peculiarity: whenever she notices that\r\nshe is chortling along without saying anything, she pulls up with a\r\nsudden \u201cGod is over us all,\u201d or some other sounding irrelevancy, and for\r\nthe moment it seems to light up the whole district; then, before you can\r\nrecover from the shock, she goes flitting pleasantly and meaninglessly\r\nalong again, and you hurry hopefully after her, thinking you are going\r\nto get something this time; but as soon as she has led you far enough\r\naway from her turkey lot she takes to a tree. Whenever she discovers\r\nthat she is getting pretty disconnected, she couples-up with an\r\nostentatious \u201cBut\u201d which has nothing to do with anything that went\r\nbefore or is to come after, then she hitches some empties to the\r\ntrain-unrelated verses from the Bible, usually--and steams out of sight\r\nand leaves you wondering how she did that clever thing. For striking\r\ninstances, see bottom paragraph on page 34 and the paragraph on page\r\n35 of her Autobiography. She has a purpose--a deep and dark and artful\r\npurpose--in what she is saying in the first paragraph, and you guess\r\nwhat it is, but that is due to your own talent, not hers; she has\r\nmade it as obscure as language could do it. The other paragraph has\r\nno meaning and no discoverable intention. It is merely one of her\r\nGod-over-alls. I cannot spare room for it in this place.\r\n\r\n\u201cI beheld with ineffable awe our great Master's marvelous skill in\r\ndemanding neither obedience to hygienic laws nor,\u201d etc. Page 41.\r\n\r\nThe word is loosely chosen-skill. She probably meant judgment,\r\nintuition, penetration, or wisdom.\r\n\r\n\u201cNaturally, my first jottings were but efforts to express in feeble\r\ndiction Truth's ultimate.\u201d Page 42.\r\n\r\nOne understands what she means, but she should have been able to say\r\nwhat she meant--at any time before she discovered Christian Science and\r\nforgot everything she knew--and after it, too. If she had put \u201cfeeble\u201d\r\n in front of \u201cefforts\u201d and then left out \u201cin\u201d and \u201cdiction,\u201d she would\r\nhave scored.\r\n\r\n\u201c... its written expression increases in perfection under the guidance\r\nof the great Master.\u201d Page 43.\r\n\r\nIt is an error. Not even in those advantageous circumstances can\r\nincrease be added to perfection.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvil is not mastered by evil; it can only be overcome with Good.\r\nThis brings out the nothingness of evil, and the eternal Somethingness\r\nvindicates the Divine Principle and improves the race of Adam.\u201d Page 76.\r\n\r\nThis is too extraneous for me. That is the trouble with Mrs. Eddy when\r\nshe sets out to explain an over-large exhibit: the minute you think the\r\nlight is bursting upon you the candle goes out and your mind begins to\r\nwander.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo one else can drain the cup which I have drunk to the dregs, as the\r\ndiscoverer and teacher of Christian Science\u201d Page 47.\r\n\r\nThat is saying we cannot empty an empty cup. We knew it before; and we\r\nknow she meant to tell us that that particular cup is going to remain\r\nempty. That is, we think that that was the idea, but we cannot be sure.\r\nShe has a perfectly astonishing talent for putting words together\r\nin such a way as to make successful inquiry into their intention\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nShe generally makes us uneasy when she begins to tune up on her\r\nfine-writing timbrel. It carries me back to her Plague-Spot and Poetry\r\ndays, and I just dread those:\r\n\r\n\u201cInto mortal mind's material obliquity I gazed and stood abashed.\r\nBlanched was the cheek of pride. My heart bent low before the\r\nomnipotence of Spirit, and a tint of humility soft as the heart of\r\na moonbeam mantled the earth. Bethlehem and Bethany, Gethsemane and\r\nCalvary, spoke to my chastened sense as by the tearful lips of a babe.\u201d\r\n Page 48.\r\n\r\nThe heart of a moonbeam is a pretty enough Friendship's-Album\r\nexpression--let it pass, though I do think the figure a little strained;\r\nbut humility has no tint, humility has no complexion, and if it had it\r\ncould not mantle the earth. A moonbeam might--I do not know--but she\r\ndid not say it was the moonbeam. But let it go, I cannot decide it, she\r\nmixes me up so. A babe hasn't \u201ctearful lips,\u201d it's its eyes. You find\r\nnone of Mrs. Eddy's kind of English in Science and Health--not a line of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nSetting aside title-page, index, etc., the little Autobiography begins\r\non page 7 and ends on page 130. My quotations are from the first forty\r\npages. They seem to me to prove the presence of the 'prentice hand. The\r\nstyle of the forty pages is loose and feeble and 'prentice-like. The\r\nmovement of the narrative is not orderly and sequential, but rambles\r\naround, and skips forward and back and here and there and yonder,\r\n'prentice-fashion. Many a journeyman has broken up his narrative and\r\nskipped about and rambled around, but he did it for a purpose, for\r\nan advantage; there was art in it, and points to be scored by it; the\r\nobservant reader perceived the game, and enjoyed it and respected it, if\r\nit was well played. But Mrs. Eddy's performance was without intention,\r\nand destitute of art. She could score no points by it on those terms,\r\nand almost any reader can see that her work was the uncalculated\r\nputtering of a novice.\r\n\r\nIn the above paragraph I have described the first third of the booklet.\r\nThat third being completed, Mrs. Eddy leaves the rabbit-range,\r\ncrosses the frontier, and steps out upon her far-spreading big-game\r\nterritory--Christian Science and there is an instant change! The style\r\nsmartly improves; and the clumsy little technical offenses disappear. In\r\nthese two-thirds of the booklet I find only one such offence, and it has\r\nthe look of being a printer's error.\r\n\r\nI leave the riddle with the reader. Perhaps he can explain how it is\r\nthat a person-trained or untrained--who on the one day can write nothing\r\nbetter than Plague-Spot-Bacilli and feeble and stumbling and wandering\r\npersonal history littered with false figures and obscurities and\r\ntechnical blunders, can on the next day sit down and write fluently,\r\nsmoothly, compactly, capably, and confidently on a great big thundering\r\nsubject, and do it as easily and comfortably as a whale paddles around\r\nthe globe.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I have scribbled so much in fifty years that I have become\r\nsaturated with convictions of one sort and another concerning a\r\nscribbler's limitations; and these are so strong that when I am familiar\r\nwith a literary person's work I feel perfectly sure that I know enough\r\nabout his limitations to know what he can not do. If Mr. Howells should\r\npretend to me that he wrote the Plague-Spot Bacilli rhapsody, I should\r\nreceive the statement courteously; but I should know it for a--well, for\r\na perversion. If the late Josh Billings should rise up and tell me that\r\nhe wrote Herbert Spencer's philosophies; I should answer and say that\r\nthe spelling casts a doubt upon his claim. If the late Jonathan Edwards\r\nshould rise up and tell me he wrote Mr. Dooley's books, I should answer\r\nand say that the marked difference between his style and Dooley's is\r\nargument against the soundness of his statement. You see how much I\r\nthink of circumstantial evidence. In literary matters--in my belief--it\r\nis often better than any person's word, better than any shady\r\ncharacter's oath. It is difficult for me to believe that the same hand\r\nthat wrote the Plague-Spot-Bacilli and the first third of the little\r\nEddy biography wrote also Science and Health. Indeed, it is more than\r\ndifficult, it is impossible.\r\n\r\nLargely speaking, I have read acres of what purported to be Mrs. Eddy's\r\nwritings, in the past two months. I cannot know, but I am convinced,\r\nthat the circumstantial evidence shows that her actual share in the\r\nwork of composing and phrasing these things was so slight as to be\r\ninconsequential. Where she puts her literary foot down, her trail\r\nacross her paid polisher's page is as plain as the elephant's in a\r\nSunday-school procession. Her verbal output, when left undoctored by\r\nher clerks, is quite unmistakable It always exhibits the strongly\r\ndistinctive features observable in the virgin passages from her pen\r\nalready quoted by me:\r\n\r\nDesert vacancy, as regards thought. Self-complacency. Puerility.\r\nSentimentality. Affectations of scholarly learning. Lust after eloquent\r\nand flowery expression. Repetition of pet poetic picturesquenesses.\r\nConfused and wandering statement. Metaphor gone insane. Meaningless\r\nwords, used because they are pretty, or showy, or unusual. Sorrowful\r\nattempts at the epigrammatic. Destitution of originality.\r\n\r\nThe fat volume called Miscellaneous Writings of Mrs. Eddy contains\r\nseveral hundred pages. Of the five hundred and fifty-four pages of prose\r\nin it I find ten lines, on page 319, to be Mrs. Eddy's; also about a\r\npage of the preface or \u201cProspectus\u201d; also about fifteen pages scattered\r\nalong through the book. If she wrote any of the rest of the prose, it\r\nwas rewritten after her by another hand. Here I will insert two-thirds\r\nof her page of the prospectus. It is evident that whenever, under the\r\ninspiration of the Deity, she turns out a book, she is always allowed to\r\ndo some of the preface. I wonder why that is? It always mars the work.\r\nI think it is done in humorous malice I think the clerks like to see\r\nher give herself away. They know she will, her stock of usable materials\r\nbeing limited and her procedure in employing them always the same,\r\nsubstantially. They know that when the initiated come upon her first\r\nerudite allusion, or upon any one of her other stage-properties, they\r\ncan shut their eyes and tell what will follow. She usually throws off\r\nan easy remark all sodden with Greek or Hebrew or Latin learning; she\r\nusually has a person watching for a star--she can seldom get away\r\nfrom that poetic idea--sometimes it is a Chaldee, sometimes a Walking\r\nDelegate, sometimes an entire stranger, but be he what he may, he is\r\ngenerally there when the train is ready to move, and has his pass in his\r\nhat-band; she generally has a Being with a Dome on him, or some other\r\ncover that is unusual and out of the fashion; she likes to fire off a\r\nScripture-verse where it will make the handsomest noise and come nearest\r\nto breaking the connection; she often throws out a Forefelt, or a\r\nForesplendor, or a Foreslander where it will have a fine nautical\r\nforeto'gallant sound and make the sentence sing; after which she is\r\nnearly sure to throw discretion away and take to her deadly passion,\r\nIntoxicated Metaphor. At such a time the Mrs. Eddy that does not\r\nhesitate is lost:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe ancient Greek looked longingly for the Olympiad. The Chaldee\r\nwatched the appearing of a star; to him no higher destiny dawned on the\r\ndome of being than that foreshadowed by signs in the heavens. The meek\r\nNazarene, the scoffed of all scoffers, said, 'Ye can discern the face\r\nof the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?'--for He\r\nforefelt and foresaw the ordeal of a perfect Christianity, hated by\r\nsinners.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo kindle all minds with a gleam of gratitude, the new idea that comes\r\nwelling up from infinite Truth needs to be understood. The seer of this\r\nage should be a sage.\r\n\r\n\u201cHumility is the stepping-stone to a higher recognition of Deity. The\r\nmounting sense gathers fresh forms and strange fire from the ashes\r\nof dissolving self, and drops the world. Meekness heightens immortal\r\nattributes, only by removing the dust that dims them. Goodness reveals\r\nanother scene and another self seemingly rolled up in shades, but\r\nbrought to light by the evolutions of advancing thought, whereby we\r\ndiscern the power of Truth and Love to heal the sick.\r\n\r\n\u201cPride is ignorance; those assume most who have the least wisdom or\r\nexperience; and they steal from their neighbor, because they have so\r\nlittle of their own.\u201d--Miscellaneous Writings, page 1, and six lines at\r\ntop of page 2.\r\n\r\nIt is not believable that the hand that wrote those clumsy and affected\r\nsentences wrote the smooth English of Science and Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nIt is often said in print that Mrs. Eddy claims that God was the Author\r\nof Science and Health. Mr. Peabody states in his pamphlet that \u201cshe says\r\nnot she but God was the Author.\u201d I cannot find that in her autobiography\r\nshe makes this transference of the authorship, but I think that in\r\nit she definitely claims that she did her work under His\r\ninspiration--definitely for her; for as a rule she is not a very\r\ndefinite person, even when she seems to be trying her best to be clear\r\nand positive. Speaking of the early days when her Science was beginning\r\nto unfold itself and gather form in her mind, she says (Autobiography,\r\npage 43):\r\n\r\n\u201cThe divine hand led me into a new world of light and Life, a fresh\r\nuniverse--old to God, but new to His 'little one.'\u201d\r\n\r\nShe being His little one, as I understand it.\r\n\r\nThe divine hand led her. It seems to mean \u201cGod inspired me\u201d; but when\r\na person uses metaphors instead of statistics--and that is Mrs. Eddy's\r\ncommon fashion--one cannot always feel sure about the intention.\r\n\r\n[Page 56.] \u201cEven the Scripture gave no direct interpretation of the\r\nScientific basis for demonstrating the spiritual Principle of healing,\r\nuntil our Heavenly Father saw fit, through the Key to the Scriptures, in\r\nScience and Health, to unlock this 'mystery of godliness.'\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother baffling metaphor. If she had used plain forecastle English,\r\nand said \u201cGod wrote the Key and I put it in my book\u201d; or if she had said\r\n\u201cGod furnished me the solution of the mystery and I put it on paper\u201d;\r\nor if she had said \u201cGod did it all,\u201d then we should understand; but her\r\nphrase is open to any and all of those translations, and is a Key\r\nwhich unlocks nothing--for us. However, it seems to at least mean \u201cGod\r\ninspired me,\u201d if nothing more.\r\n\r\nThere was personal and intimate communion, at any rate we get that\r\nmuch out of the riddles. The connection extended to business, after the\r\nestablishment of the teaching and healing industry.\r\n\r\n[Page 71.] \u201cWhen God impelled me to set a price on my instruction,\u201d etc.\r\nFurther down: \u201cGod has since shown me, in multitudinous ways, the wisdom\r\nof this decision.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was not able to think of a \u201cfinancial equivalent\u201d--meaning a\r\npecuniary equivalent--for her \u201cinstruction in Christian Science\r\nMind-healing.\u201d In this emergency she was \u201cled\u201d to charge three hundred\r\ndollars for a term of \u201ctwelve half-days.\u201d She does not say who led her,\r\nshe only says that the amount greatly troubled her. I think it means\r\nthat the price was suggested from above, \u201cled\u201d being a theological term\r\nidentical with our commercial phrase \u201cpersonally conducted.\u201d She \u201cshrank\r\nfrom asking it, but was finally led, by a strange providence, to accept\r\nthis fee.\u201d \u201cProvidence\u201d is another theological term. Two leds and\r\na providence, taken together, make a pretty strong argument for\r\ninspiration. I think that these statistics make it clear that the price\r\nwas arranged above. This view is constructively supported by the fact,\r\nalready quoted, that God afterwards approved, \u201cin multitudinous\r\nways,\u201d her wisdom in accepting the mentioned fee. \u201cMultitudinous\r\nways\u201d--multitudinous encoring--suggests enthusiasm. Business enthusiasm.\r\nAnd it suggests nearness. God's nearness to his \u201clittle one.\u201d Nearness,\r\nand a watchful personal interest. A warm, palpitating, Standard-Oil\r\ninterest, so to speak. All this indicates inspiration. We may assume,\r\nthen, two inspirations: one for the book, the other for the business.\r\n\r\nThe evidence for inspiration is further augmented by the testimony of\r\nRev. George Tomkins, D.D., already quoted, that Mrs. Eddy and her book\r\nwere foretold in Revelation, and that Mrs. Eddy \u201cis God's brightest\r\nthought to this age, giving us the spiritual interpretation of the Bible\r\nin the 'little book'\u201d of the Angel.\r\n\r\nI am aware that it is not Mr. Tomkins that is speaking, but Mrs. Eddy.\r\nThe commissioned lecturers of the Christian Science Church have to be\r\nmembers of the Board of Lectureship. (By-laws Sec. 2, p. 70.) The Board\r\nof Lectureship is selected by the Board of Directors of the Church.\r\n(By-laws, Sec. 3, p. 70.) The Board of Directors of the Church is the\r\nproperty of Mrs. Eddy. (By-laws, p. 22.) Mr. Tomkins did not make that\r\nstatement without authorization from headquarters. He necessarily got it\r\nfrom the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors from Mrs. Eddy, Mrs.\r\nEddy from the Deity. Mr. Tomkins would have been turned down by that\r\nprocession if his remarks had been unsatisfactory to it.\r\n\r\nIt may be that there is evidence somewhere--as has been claimed--that\r\nMrs. Eddy has charged upon the Deity the verbal authorship of Science\r\nand Health. But if she ever made the charge, she has withdrawn it (as it\r\nseems to me), and in the most formal and unqualified; of all ways. See\r\nAutobiography, page 57:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen the demand for this book increased... the copyright was infringed.\r\nI entered a suit at Law, and my copyright was protected.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus it is plain that she did not plead that the Deity was the (verbal)\r\nAuthor; for if she had done that, she would have lost her case--and with\r\nrude promptness. It was in the old days before the Berne Convention and\r\nbefore the passage of our amended law of 1891, and the court would have\r\nquoted the following stern clause from the existing statute and frowned\r\nher out of the place:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo Foreigner can acquire copyright in the United States.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo sum up. The evidence before me indicates three things:\r\n\r\n1. That Mrs. Eddy claims the verbal author ship for herself. 2. That she\r\ndenies it to the Deity. 3. That--in her belief--she wrote the book under\r\nthe inspiration of the Deity, but furnished the language herself.\r\n\r\nIn one place in the Autobiography she claims both the language and\r\nthe ideas; but when this witness is testifying, one must draw the line\r\nsomewhere, or she will prove both sides of her case-nine sides, if\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nIt is too true. Much too true. Many, many times too true. She is a most\r\ntrying witness--the most trying witness that ever kissed the Book, I am\r\nsure. There is no keeping up with her erratic testimony. As soon as you\r\nhave got her share of the authorship nailed where you half hope and half\r\nbelieve it will stay and cannot be joggled loose any more, she joggles\r\nit loose again--or seems to; you cannot be sure, for her habit of\r\ndealing in meaningless metaphors instead of in plain, straightforward\r\nstatistics, makes it nearly always impossible to tell just what it\r\nis she is trying to say. She was definite when she claimed both the\r\nlanguage and the ideas of the book. That seemed to settle the matter.\r\nIt seemed to distribute the percentages of credit with precision between\r\nthe collaborators: ninety-two per cent. to Mrs. Eddy, who did all the\r\nwork, and eight per cent. to the Deity, who furnished the inspiration\r\nnot enough of it to damage the copyright in a country closed against\r\nForeigners, and yet plenty to advertise the book and market it at famine\r\nrates. Then Mrs. Eddy does not keep still, but fetches around and comes\r\nforward and testifies again. It is most injudicious. For she resorts to\r\nmetaphor this time, and it makes trouble, for she seems to reverse the\r\npercentages and claim only the eight per cent. for her self. I quote\r\nfrom Mr. Peabody's book (Eddyism, or Christian Science. Boston: 15 Court\r\nSquare, price twenty-five cents):\r\n\r\n\u201cSpeaking of this book, Mrs. Eddy, in January last (1901) said: 'I\r\nshould blush to write of Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures,\r\nas I have, were it of human origin, and I, apart from God, its author;\r\nbut as I was only a scribe echoing the harmonies of Heaven in\r\ndivine metaphysics, I cannot be supermodest of the Christian Science\r\ntext-book.\u201d'\r\n\r\nMr. Peabody's comment:\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing could be plainer than that. Here is a distinct avowal that the\r\nbook entitled Science and Health was the work of Almighty God.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt does seem to amount to that. She was only a \u201cscribe.\u201d Confound the\r\nword, it is just a confusion, it has no determinable meaning there, it\r\nleaves us in the air. A scribe is merely a person who writes. He may be\r\na copyist, he may be an amanuensis, he may be a writer of originals, and\r\nfurnish both the language and the ideas. As usual with Mrs. Eddy, the\r\nconnection affords no help--\u201cechoing\u201d throws no light upon \u201cscribe.\u201d A\r\nrock can reflect an echo, a wall can do it, a mountain can do it, many\r\nthings can do it, but a scribe can't. A scribe that could reflect\r\nan echo could get over thirty dollars a week in a side-show. Many\r\nimpresarios would rather have him than a cow with four tails. If we\r\nallow that this present scribe was setting down the \u201charmonies of\r\nHeaven\u201d--and certainly that seems to have been the case then there was\r\nonly one way to do it that I can think of: listen to the music and put\r\ndown the notes one after another as they fell. In that case Mrs.\r\nEddy did not invent the tune, she only entered it on paper. Therefore\r\ndropping the metaphor--she was merely an amanuensis, and furnished\r\nneither the language of Science and Health nor the ideas. It reduces her\r\nto eight per cent. (and the dividends on that and the rest).\r\n\r\nIs that it? We shall never know. For Mrs. Eddy is liable to testify\r\nagain at any time. But until she does it, I think we must conclude\r\nthat the Deity was Author of the whole book, and Mrs. Eddy merely His\r\ntelephone and stenographer. Granting this, her claim as the Voice of God\r\nstands-for the present--justified and established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT\r\n\r\nI overlooked something. It appears that there was more of that utterance\r\nthan Mr. Peabody has quoted in the above paragraph. It will be found\r\nin Mrs. Eddy's organ, the Christian Science Journal (January, 1901) and\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was not myself... which dictated Science and Health, with Key to the\r\nScriptures.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat is certainly clear enough. The words which I have removed from that\r\nimportant sentence explain Who it was that did the dictating. It was\r\ndone by\r\n\r\n\u201cthe divine power of Truth and Love, infinitely above me.\u201d\r\n\r\nCertainly that is definite. At last, through her personal testimony,\r\nwe have a sure grip upon the following vital facts, and they settle the\r\nauthorship of Science and Health beyond peradventure:\r\n\r\n1. Mrs. Eddy furnished \u201cthe ideas and the language.\u201d 2. God furnished\r\nthe ideas and the language.\r\n\r\nIt is a great comfort to have the matter authoritatively settled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nIt is hard to locate her, she shifts about so much. She is a shining\r\ndrop of quicksilver which you put your finger on and it isn't there.\r\nThere is a paragraph in the Autobiography (page 96) which places in\r\nseemingly darkly significant procession three Personages:\r\n\r\n1. The Virgin Mary 2. Jesus of Nazareth. 3. Mrs. Eddy.\r\n\r\nThis is the paragraph referred to:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo person can take the individual place of the Virgin Mary. No person\r\ncan compass or fulfil the individual mission of Jesus of Nazareth.\r\nNo person can take the place of the author of Science and Health, the\r\ndiscoverer and founder of Christian Science. Each individual must fill\r\nhis own niche in time and eternity.\u201d\r\n\r\nI have read it many times, but I still cannot be sure that I rightly\r\nunderstand it. If the Saviour's name had been placed first and the\r\nVirgin Mary's second and Mrs. Eddy's third, I should draw the inference\r\nthat a descending scale from First Importance to Second Importance and\r\nthen to Small Importance was indicated; but to place the Virgin first,\r\nthe Saviour second, and Mrs. Eddy third, seems to turn the scale the\r\nother way and make it an ascending scale of Importances, with Mrs. Eddy\r\nranking the other two and holding first place.\r\n\r\nI think that that was perhaps the intention, but none but a seasoned\r\nChristian Scientist can examine a literary animal of Mrs. Eddy's\r\ncreation and tell which end of it the tail is on. She is easily the most\r\nbaffling and bewildering writer in the literary trade.\r\n\r\nEddy is a commonplace name, and would have an unimpressive aspect in the\r\nlist of the reformed Holy Family. She has thought of that. In the book\r\nof By-laws written by her--\u201cimpelled by a power not one's own\u201d--there is\r\na paragraph which explains how and when her disciples came to confer a\r\ntitle upon her; and this explanation is followed by a warning as to what\r\nwill happen to any female Scientist who shall desecrate it:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe title of Mother. Therefore if a student of Christian Science shall\r\napply this title, either to herself or to others, except as the term for\r\nkinship according to the flesh, it shall be regarded by the Church as an\r\nindication of disrespect for their Pastor Emeritus, and unfitness to be\r\na member of the Mother-Church.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe is the Pastor Emeritus.\r\n\r\nWhile the quoted paragraph about the Procession seems to indicate that\r\nMrs. Eddy is expecting to occupy the First Place in it, that expectation\r\nis not definitely avowed. In an earlier utterance of hers she is\r\nclearer--clearer, and does not claim the first place all to herself, but\r\nonly the half of it. I quote from Mr. Peabody's book again:\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the Christian Science Journal for April, 1889, when it was her\r\nproperty, and published by her, it was claimed for her, and with her\r\nsanction, that she was equal with Jesus, and elaborate effort was made\r\nto establish the claim.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Eddy has distinctly authorized the claim in her behalf that she\r\nherself was the chosen successor to and equal of Jesus.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn her Miscellaneous Writings (using her once favorite \u201cWe\u201d for \u201cI\u201d) she\r\nsays that \u201cWhile we entertain decided views... and shall express them as\r\nduty demands, we shall claim no especial gift from our divine origin,\u201d\r\n etc.\r\n\r\nOur divine origin. It suggests Equal again. It is inferable, then,\r\nthat in the near by-and-by the new Church will officially rank the Holy\r\nFamily in the following order:\r\n\r\n1. Jesus of Nazareth.--1. Our Mother. 2. The Virgin Mary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nI am not playing with Christian Science and its founder, I am examining\r\nthem; and I am doing it because of the interest I feel in the inquiry.\r\nMy results may seem inadequate to the reader, but they have for me\r\nclarified a muddle and brought a sort of order out of a chaos, and so I\r\nvalue them.\r\n\r\nMy readings of Mrs. Eddy's uninspired miscellaneous literary efforts\r\nhave convinced me of several things:\r\n\r\n1. That she did not write Science and Health. 2. That the Deity did (or\r\ndid not) write it. 3. That She thinks She wrote it. 4. That She believes\r\nShe wrote it under the Deity's inspiration. 5. That She believes She is\r\na Member of the Holy Family. 6. That She believes She is the equal of\r\nthe Head of it.\r\n\r\nFinally, I think She is now entitled to the capital S--on her own\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nThus far we have a part of Mrs. Eddy's portrait. Not made of fictions,\r\nsurmises, reports, rumors, innuendoes, dropped by her enemies; no, she\r\nhas furnished all of the materials herself, and laid them on the canvas,\r\nunder my general superintendence and direction. As far as she has gone\r\nwith it, it is the presentation of a complacent, commonplace, illiterate\r\nNew England woman who \u201cforgot everything she knew\u201d when she discovered\r\nher discovery, then wrote a Bible in good English under the inspiration\r\nof God, and climbed up it to the supremest summit of earthly grandeur\r\nattainable by man--where she sits serene to-day, beloved and worshiped\r\nby a multitude of human beings of as good average intelligence as is\r\npossessed by those that march under the banner of any competing cult.\r\nThis is not intended to flatter the competing cults, it is merely a\r\nstatement of cold fact.\r\n\r\nThat a commonplace person should go climbing aloft and become a god or\r\na half-god or a quarter-god and be worshiped by men and women of average\r\nintelligence, is nothing. It has happened a million times, it will\r\nhappen a hundred million more. It has been millions of years since the\r\nfirst of these supernaturals appeared, and by the time the last one in\r\nthat inconceivably remote future shall have performed his solemn little\r\nhigh-jinks on the stage and closed the business, there will be enough\r\nof them accumulated in the museum on the Other Side to start a heaven of\r\ntheir own-and jam it.\r\n\r\nEach in his turn those little supernaturals of our by-gone ages and\r\naeons joined the monster procession of his predecessors and marched\r\nhorizonward, disappeared, and was forgotten. They changed nothing,\r\nthey built nothing, they left nothing behind them to remember them by,\r\nnothing to hold their disciples together, nothing to solidify their work\r\nand enable it to defy the assaults of time and the weather. They passed,\r\nand left a vacancy. They made one fatal mistake; they all made it,\r\neach in his turn: they failed to organize their forces, they failed to\r\ncentralize their strength, they failed to provide a fresh Bible and a\r\nsure and perpetual cash income for business, and often they failed to\r\nprovide a new and accepted Divine Personage to worship.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eddy is not of that small fry. The materials that go to the\r\nmaking of the rest of her portrait will prove it. She will furnish them\r\nherself:\r\n\r\nShe published her book. She copyrighted it. She copyrights everything.\r\nIf she should say, \u201cGood-morning; how do you do?\u201d she would copyright\r\nit; for she is a careful person, and knows the value of small things.\r\n\r\nShe began to teach her Science, she began to heal, she began to gather\r\nconverts to her new religion--fervent, sincere, devoted, grateful\r\npeople. A year or two later she organized her first Christian Science\r\n\u201cAssociation,\u201d with six of her disciples on the roster.\r\n\r\nShe continued to teach and heal. She was charging nothing, she says,\r\nalthough she was very poor. She taught and healed gratis four years\r\naltogether, she says.\r\n\r\nThen, in 1879-81 she was become strong enough, and well enough\r\nestablished, to venture a couple of impressively important moves. The\r\nfirst of these moves was to aggrandize the \u201cAssociation\u201d to a \u201cChurch.\u201d\r\n Brave? It is the right name for it, I think. The former name suggests\r\nnothing, invited no remark, no criticism, no inquiry, no hostility; the\r\nnew name invited them all. She must have made this intrepid venture on\r\nher own motion. She could have had no important advisers at that early\r\nday. If we accept it as her own idea and her own act--and I think we\r\nmust--we have one key to her character. And it will explain subsequent\r\nacts of hers that would merely stun us and stupefy us without it. Shall\r\nwe call it courage? Or shall we call it recklessness? Courage observes;\r\nreflects; calculates; surveys the whole situation; counts the cost,\r\nestimates the odds, makes up its mind; then goes at the enterprise\r\nresolute to win or perish. Recklessness does not reflect, it plunges\r\nfearlessly in with a hurrah, and takes the risks, whatever they may be,\r\nregardless of expense. Recklessness often fails, Mrs. Eddy has never\r\nfailed--from the point of view of her followers. The point of view of\r\nother people is naturally not a matter of weighty importance to her.\r\n\r\nThe new Church was not born loose-jointed and featureless, but had a\r\ndefined plan, a definite character, definite aims, and a name which was\r\na challenge, and defied all comers. It was \u201ca Mind-healing Church.\u201d It\r\nwas \u201cwithout a creed.\u201d Its name, \u201cThe Church of Christ, Scientist.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Eddy could not copyright her Church, but she chartered it, which\r\nwas the same thing and relieved the pain. It had twenty-six charter\r\nmembers. Mrs. Eddy was at once installed as its pastor.\r\n\r\nThe other venture, above referred to, was Mrs. Eddy's Massachusetts\r\nMetaphysical College, in which was taught \u201cthe pathology of spiritual\r\npower.\u201d She could not copyright it, but she got it chartered. For\r\nfaculty it had herself, her husband of the period (Dr. Eddy), and her\r\nadopted son, Dr. Foster-Eddy. The college term was \u201cbarely three\r\nweeks,\u201d she says. Again she was bold, brave, rash, reckless--choose for\r\nyourself--for she not only began to charge the student, but charged him\r\na hundred dollars a week for the enlightenments. And got it? some may\r\nask. Easily. Pupils flocked from far and near. They came by the hundred.\r\nPresently the term was cut down nearly half, but the price remained as\r\nbefore. To be exact, the term-cut was to seven lessons--price,\r\nthree hundred dollars. The college \u201cyielded a large income.\u201d This is\r\nbelievable. In seven years Mrs. Eddy taught, as she avers, over four\r\nthousand students in it. (Preface to 1902 edition of Science and\r\nHealth.) Three hundred times four thousand is--but perhaps you can\r\ncipher it yourself. I could do it ordinarily, but I fell down yesterday\r\nand hurt my leg. Cipher it; you will see that it is a grand sum for a\r\nwoman to earn in seven years. Yet that was not all she got out of her\r\ncollege in the seven.\r\n\r\nAt the time that she was charging the primary student three hundred\r\ndollars for twelve lessons she was not content with this tidy\r\nassessment, but had other ways of plundering him. By advertisement she\r\noffered him privileges whereby he could add eighteen lessons to his\r\nstore for five hundred dollars more. That is to say, he could get a\r\ntotal of thirty lessons in her college for eight hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nFour thousand times eight hundred is--but it is a difficult sum for a\r\ncripple who has not been \u201cdemonstrated over\u201d to cipher; let it go.\r\nShe taught \u201cover\u201d four thousand students in seven years. \u201cOver\u201d is not\r\ndefinite, but it probably represents a non-paying surplus of learners\r\nover and above the paying four thousand. Charity students, doubtless. I\r\nthink that as interesting an advertisement as has been printed since the\r\nromantic old days of the other buccaneers is this one from the Christian\r\nScience Journal for September, 1886:\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cMASSACHUSETTS METAPHYSICAL COLLEGE\r\n\r\n\u201cRev. MARY BAKER G. EDDY, PRESIDENT\r\n\r\n\u201c571 Columbus Avenue, Boston\r\n\r\n\u201cThe collegiate course in Christian Science metaphysical healing\r\nincludes twelve lessons. Tuition, three hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n\u201cCourse in metaphysical obstetrics includes six daily lectures, and is\r\nopen only to students from this college. Tuition, one hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n\u201cClass in theology, open (like the above) to graduates, receives six\r\nadditional lectures on the Scriptures, and summary of the principle and\r\npractice of Christian Science, two hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n\u201cNormal class is open to those who have taken the first course at this\r\ncollege; six daily lectures complete the Normal course. Tuition, two\r\nhundred dollars.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo invalids, and only persons of good moral character, are accepted\r\nas students. All students are subject to examination and rejection; and\r\nthey are liable to leave the class if found unfit to remain in it.\r\n\r\n\u201cA limited number of clergymen received free of charge.\r\n\r\n\u201cLargest discount to indigent students, one hundred dollars on the first\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo deduction on the others.\r\n\r\n\u201cHusband and wife, entered together, three hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n\u201cTuition for all strictly in advance.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere it is--the horse-leech's daughter alive again, after a\r\nthree-century vacation. Fifty or sixty hours' lecturing for eight\r\nhundred dollars.\r\n\r\nI was in error as to one matter: there are no charity students.\r\nGratis-taught clergymen must not be placed under that head; they are\r\nmerely an advertisement. Pauper students can get into the infant class\r\non a two-third rate (cash in advance), but not even an archangel can get\r\ninto the rest of the game at anything short of par, cash down. For it is\r\n\u201cin the spirit of Christ's charity, as one who is joyful to hear healing\r\nto the sick\u201d that Mrs. Eddy is working the game. She sends the healing\r\nto them outside. She cannot bear it to them inside the college, for the\r\nreason that she does not allow a sick candidate to get in. It is true\r\nthat this smells of inconsistency, but that is nothing; Mrs. Eddy\r\nwould not be Mrs. Eddy if she should ever chance to be consistent about\r\nanything two days running.\r\n\r\nExcept in the matter of the Dollar. The Dollar, and appetite for power\r\nand notoriety. English must also be added; she is always consistent,\r\nshe is always Mrs. Eddy, in her English: it is always and consistently\r\nconfused and crippled and poor. She wrote the Advertisement; her\r\nliterary trade-marks are there. When she says all \u201cstudents\u201d are subject\r\nto examination, she does not mean students, she means candidates for\r\nthat lofty place When she says students are \u201cliable\u201d to leave the class\r\nif found unfit to remain in it, she does not mean that if they find\r\nthemselves unfit, or be found unfit by others, they will be likely to\r\nask permission to leave the class; she means that if she finds them\r\nunfit she will be \u201cliable\u201d to fire them out. When she nobly offers\r\n\u201ctuition for all strictly in advance,\u201d she does not mean \u201cinstruction\r\nfor all in advance-payment for it later.\u201d No, that is only what she\r\nsays, it is not what she means. If she had written Science and Health,\r\nthe oldest man in the world would not be able to tell with certainty\r\nwhat any passage in it was intended to mean.\r\n\r\nHer Church was on its legs.\r\n\r\nShe was its pastor. It was prospering.\r\n\r\nShe was appointed one of a committee to draught By-laws for its\r\ngovernment. It may be observed, without overplus of irreverence, that\r\nthis was larks for her. She did all of the draughting herself. From the\r\nvery beginning she was always in the front seat when there was business\r\nto be done; in the front seat, with both eyes open, and looking sharply\r\nout for Number One; in the front seat, working Mortal Mind with fine\r\neffectiveness and giving Immortal Mind a rest for Sunday. When her\r\nChurch was reorganized, by-and-by, the By-laws were retained. She saw\r\nto that. In these Laws for the government of her Church, her empire, her\r\ndespotism, Mrs. Eddy's character is embalmed for good and all. I think\r\na particularized examination of these Church-laws will be found\r\ninteresting. And not the less so if we keep in mind that they were\r\n\u201cimpelled by a power not one's own,\u201d as she says--Anglice--the\r\ninspiration of God.\r\n\r\nIt is a Church \u201cwithout a creed.\u201d Still, it has one. Mrs. Eddy draughted\r\nit--and copyrighted it. In her own name. You cannot become a member of\r\nthe Mother-Church (nor of any Christian Science Church) without signing\r\nit. It forms the first chapter of the By-laws, and is called \u201cTenets.\u201d\r\n \u201cTenets of The Mother Church, The First Church of Christ, Scientist.\u201d It\r\nhas no hell in it--it throws it overboard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PASTOR EMERITUS\r\n\r\nAbout the time of the reorganization, Mrs. Eddy retired from her\r\nposition of pastor of her Church, abolished the office of pastor in\r\nall branch Churches, and appointed her book, Science and Health, to be\r\npastor-universal. Mrs. Eddy did not disconnect herself from the office\r\nentirely, when she retired, but appointed herself Pastor Emeritus. It is\r\na misleading title, and belongs to the family of that phrase \u201cwithout\r\na creed.\u201d It advertises her as being a merely honorary official, with\r\nnothing to do, and no authority. The Czar of Russia is Emperor Emeritus\r\non the same terms. Mrs. Eddy was Autocrat of the Church before, with\r\nlimitless authority, and she kept her grip on that limitless authority\r\nwhen she took that fictitious title.\r\n\r\nIt is curious and interesting to note with what an unerring instinct the\r\nPastor Emeritus has thought out and forecast all possible encroachments\r\nupon her planned autocracy, and barred the way against them, in the\r\nBy-laws which she framed and copyrighted--under the guidance of the\r\nSupreme Being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\r\n\r\nFor instance, when Article I. speaks of a President and Board of\r\nDirectors, you think you have discovered a formidable check upon the\r\npowers and ambitions of the honorary pastor, the ornamental pastor, the\r\nfunctionless pastor, the Pastor Emeritus, but it is a mistake. These\r\ngreat officials are of the phrase--family of the Church-Without-a-Creed\r\nand the Pastor-With-Nothing-to-Do; that is to say, of the family of\r\nLarge-Names-Which-Mean-Nothing. The Board is of so little consequence\r\nthat the By-laws do not state how it is chosen, nor who does it; but\r\nthey do state, most definitely, that the Board cannot fill a vacancy in\r\nits number \u201cexcept the candidate is approved by the Pastor Emeritus.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe \u201ccandidate.\u201d The Board cannot even proceed to an election until the\r\nPastor Emeritus has examined the list and squelched such candidates as\r\nare not satisfactory to her.\r\n\r\nWhether the original first Board began as the personal property of Mrs.\r\nEddy or not, it is foreseeable that in time, under this By-law, she\r\nwould own it. Such a first Board might chafe under such a rule as that,\r\nand try to legislate it out of existence some day. But Mrs. Eddy was\r\nawake. She foresaw that danger, and added this ingenious and effective\r\nclause:\r\n\r\n\u201cThis By-law can neither be amended nor annulled, except by consent of\r\nMrs. Eddy, the Pastor Emeritus.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT\r\n\r\nThe Board of Directors, or Serfs, or Ciphers, elects the President.\r\n\r\nOn these clearly worded terms: \u201cSubject to the approval of the Pastor\r\nEmeritus.\u201d\r\n\r\nTherefore She elects him.\r\n\r\nA long term can invest a high official with influence and power, and\r\nmake him dangerous. Mrs. Eddy reflected upon that; so she limits the\r\nPresident's term to a year. She has a capable commercial head, an\r\norganizing head, a head for government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREASURER AND CLERK\r\n\r\nThere are a Treasurer and a Clerk. They are elected by the Board of\r\nDirectors. That is to say, by Mrs. Eddy.\r\n\r\nTheir terms of office expire on the first Tuesday in June of each year,\r\n\u201cor upon the election of their successors.\u201d They must be watchfully\r\nobedient and satisfactory to her, or she will elect and install their\r\nsuccessors with a suddenness that can be unpleasant to them. It goes\r\nwithout saying that the Treasurer manages the Treasury to suit Mrs.\r\nEddy, and is in fact merely Temporary Deputy Treasurer.\r\n\r\nApparently the Clerk has but two duties to perform: to read messages\r\nfrom Mrs. Eddy to First Members assembled in solemn Council, and provide\r\nlists of candidates for Church membership. The select body entitled\r\nFirst Members are the aristocracy of the Mother-Church, the Charter\r\nMembers, the Aborigines, a sort of stylish but unsalaried little\r\nCollege of Cardinals, good for show, but not indispensable. Nobody is\r\nindispensable in Mrs. Eddy's empire; she sees to that.\r\n\r\nWhen the Pastor Emeritus sends a letter or message to that little\r\nSanhedrin, it is the Clerk's \u201cimperative duty\u201d to read it \u201cat the place\r\nand time specified.\u201d Otherwise, the world might come to an end. These\r\nare fine, large frills, and remind us of the ways of emperors and such.\r\nSuch do not use the penny-post, they send a gilded and painted special\r\nmessenger, and he strides into the Parliament, and business comes to\r\na sudden and solemn and awful stop; and in the impressive hush that\r\nfollows, the Chief Clerk reads the document. It is his \u201cimperative\r\nduty.\u201d If he should neglect it, his official life would end. It is\r\nthe same with this Mother-Church Clerk; \u201cif he fail to perform this\r\nimportant function of his office,\u201d certain majestic and unshirkable\r\nsolemnities must follow: a special meeting \u201cshall\u201d be called; a member\r\nof the Church \u201cshall\u201d make formal complaint; then the Clerk \u201cshall\u201d be\r\n\u201cremoved from office.\u201d Complaint is sufficient, no trial is necessary.\r\n\r\nThere is something very sweet and juvenile and innocent and pretty about\r\nthese little tinsel vanities, these grave apings of monarchical fuss and\r\nfeathers and ceremony, here on our ostentatiously democratic soil. She\r\nis the same lady that we found in the Autobiography, who was so naively\r\nvain of all that little ancestral military riffraff that she had dug up\r\nand annexed. A person's nature never changes. What it is in childhood,\r\nit remains. Under pressure, or a change of interest, it can partially or\r\nwholly disappear from sight, and for considerable stretches of time, but\r\nnothing can ever permanently modify it, nothing can ever remove it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOARD OF TRUSTEES\r\n\r\nThere isn't any--now. But with power and money piling up higher and\r\nhigher every day and the Church's dominion spreading daily wider and\r\nfarther, a time could come when the envious and ambitious could start\r\nthe idea that it would be wise and well to put a watch upon these\r\nassets--a watch equipped with properly large authority. By custom, a\r\nBoard of Trustees. Mrs. Eddy has foreseen that probability--for she is\r\na woman with a long, long look ahead, the longest look ahead that ever a\r\nwoman had--and she has provided for that emergency. In Art. I., Sec.\r\n5, she has decreed that no Board of Trustees shall ever exist in the\r\nMother-Church \u201cexcept it be constituted by the Pastor Emeritus.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe magnificence of it, the daring of it! Thus far, she is:\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Metaphysical College; Pastor Emeritus; President;\r\nBoard of Directors; Treasurer; Clerk; and future Board of Trustees;\r\n\r\nand is still moving onward, ever onward. When I contemplate her from\r\na commercial point of view, there are no words that can convey my\r\nadmiration of her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREADERS\r\n\r\nThese are a feature of first importance in the church-machinery of\r\nChristian Science. For they occupy the pulpit. They hold the place\r\nthat the preacher holds in the other Christian Churches. They hold that\r\nplace, but they do not preach. Two of them are on duty at a time--a man\r\nand a woman. One reads a passage from the Bible, the other reads\r\nthe explanation of it from Science and Health--and so they go on\r\nalternating. This constitutes the service--this, with choir-music. They\r\nutter no word of their own. Art. IV., Sec. 6, closes their mouths with\r\nthis uncompromising gag:\r\n\r\n\u201cThey shall make no remarks explanatory of the Lesson-Sermon at any time\r\nduring the service.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt seems a simple little thing. One is not startled by it at a first\r\nreading of it; nor at the second, nor the third. One may have to read it\r\na dozen times before the whole magnitude of it rises before the mind.\r\nIt far and away oversizes and outclasses the best business-idea yet\r\ninvented for the safe-guarding and perpetuating of a religion. If it had\r\nbeen thought of and put in force eighteen hundred and seventy years ago,\r\nthere would be but one Christian sect in the world now, instead of ten\r\ndozens of them.\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of men in the world, consequently there are\r\nmany varieties of minds in its pulpits. This insures many differing\r\ninterpretations of important Scripture texts, and this in turn insures\r\nthe splitting up of a religion into many sects. It is what has happened;\r\nit was sure to happen.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eddy has noted this disastrous result of preaching, and has put up\r\nthe bars. She will have no preaching in her Church. She has explained\r\nall essential Scriptures, and set the explanations down in her book. In\r\nher belief her underlings cannot improve upon those explanations, and\r\nin that stern sentence \u201cthey shall make no explanatory remarks\u201d she has\r\nbarred them for all time from trying. She will be obeyed; there is no\r\nquestion about that.\r\n\r\nIn arranging her government she has borrowed ideas from various\r\nsources--not poor ones, but the best in the governmental market--but\r\nthis one is new, this one came out of no ordinary business-head, this\r\none must have come out of her own, there has been no other commercial\r\nskull in a thousand centuries that was equal to it. She has borrowed\r\nfreely and wisely, but I am sure that this idea is many times\r\nlarger than all her borrowings bulked together. One must respect the\r\nbusiness-brain that produced it--the splendid pluck and impudence that\r\nventured to promulgate it, anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTION OF READERS\r\n\r\nReaders are not taken at hap-hazard, any more than preachers are taken\r\nat hap-hazard for the pulpits of other sects. No, Readers are elected by\r\nthe Board of Directors. But--\r\n\r\n\u201cSection 3. The Board shall inform the Pas. for Emeritus of the names\r\nof candidates for Readers before they are elected, and if she objects to\r\nthe nomination, said candidates shall not be chosen.\u201d\r\n\r\nIs that an election--by the Board? Thus far I have not been able to\r\nfind out what that Board of Spectres is for. It certainly has no real\r\nfunction, no duty which the hired girl could not perform, no office\r\nbeyond the mere recording of the autocrat's decrees.\r\n\r\nThere are no dangerously long office-terms in Mrs. Eddy's government.\r\nThe Readers are elected for but one year. This insures their\r\nsubserviency to their proprietor.\r\n\r\nReaders are not allowed to copy out passages and read them from the\r\nmanuscript in the pulpit; they must read from Mrs. Eddy's book itself.\r\nShe is right. Slight changes could be slyly made, repeated, and in time\r\nget acceptance with congregations. Branch sects could grow out of these\r\npractices. Mrs. Eddy knows the human race, and how far to trust it. Her\r\nlimit is not over a quarter of an inch. It is all that a wise person\r\nwill risk.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eddy's inborn disposition to copyright everything, charter\r\neverything, secure the rightful and proper credit to herself for\r\neverything she does, and everything she thinks she does, and everything\r\nshe thinks, and everything she thinks she thinks or has thought or\r\nintends to think, is illustrated in Sec. 5 of Art. IV., defining the\r\nduties of official Readers--in church:\r\n\r\n\u201cNaming Book and Author. The Reader of Science and Health, with Key\r\nto the Scriptures, before commencing to read from this book, shall\r\ndistinctly announce its full title and give the author's name.\u201d\r\n\r\nOtherwise the congregation might get the habit of forgetting who\r\n(ostensibly) wrote the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARISTOCRACY\r\n\r\nThis consists of First Members and their apostolic succession. It is a\r\nclose corporation, and its membership limit is one hundred. Forty will\r\nanswer, but if the number fall below that, there must be an election, to\r\nfill the grand quorum.\r\n\r\nThis Sanhedrin can't do anything of the slightest importance, but it\r\ncan talk. It can \u201cdiscuss.\u201d That is, it can discuss \u201cimportant questions\r\nrelative to Church members\u201d, evidently persons who are already Church\r\nmembers. This affords it amusement, and does no harm.\r\n\r\nIt can \u201cfix the salaries of the Readers.\u201d\r\n\r\nTwice a year it \u201cvotes on\u201d admitting candidates. That is, for Church\r\nmembership. But its work is cut out for it beforehand, by Art. IX.:\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery recommendation for membership In the Church 'shall be\r\ncountersigned by a loyal student of Mrs. Eddy's, by a Director of this\r\nChurch, or by a First Member.'\u201d\r\n\r\nAll these three classes of beings are the personal property of Mrs.\r\nEddy. She has absolute control of the elections.\r\n\r\nAlso it must \u201ctransact any Church business that may properly come before\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cProperly\u201d is a thoughtful word. No important business can come before\r\nit. The By laws have attended to that. No important business goes before\r\nany one for the final word except Mrs. Eddy. She has looked to that.\r\n\r\nThe Sanhedrin \u201cvotes on\u201d candidates for admission to its own body. But\r\nis its vote worth any more than mine would be? No, it isn't. Sec. 4, of\r\nArt. V.--Election of First Members--makes this quite plain:\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore being elected, the candidates for First Members shall be\r\napproved by the Pastor Emeritus over her own signature.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus the Sanhedrin is the personal property of Mrs. Eddy. She owns it.\r\nIt has no functions, no authority, no real existence. It is another\r\nBoard of Shadows. Mrs. Eddy is the Sanhedrin herself.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to foot up again and \u201csee where we are at.\u201d Thus far,\r\nMrs. Eddy is:\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Metaphysical College; Pastor Emeritus, President;\r\nBoard of Directors; Treasurer; Clerk; Future Board of Trustees;\r\nProprietor of the Priesthood: Dictator of the Services; Proprietor of\r\nthe Sanhedrin. She has come far, and is still on her way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHURCH MEMBERSHIP\r\n\r\nIn this Article there is another exhibition of a couple of the large\r\nfeatures of Mrs. Eddy's remarkable make-up: her business-talent and her\r\nknowledge of human nature.\r\n\r\nShe does not beseech and implore people to join her Church. She knows\r\nthe human race better than that. She gravely goes through the motions of\r\nreluctantly granting admission to the applicant as a favor to him. The\r\nidea is worth untold shekels. She does not stand at the gate of the fold\r\nwith welcoming arms spread, and receive the lost sheep with glad emotion\r\nand set up the fatted calf and invite the neighbor and have a time. No,\r\nshe looks upon him coldly, she snubs him, she says:\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are you? Who is your sponsor? Who asked you to come here? Go away,\r\nand don't come again until you are invited.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt is calculated to strikingly impress a person accustomed to Moody and\r\nSankey and Sam Jones revivals; accustomed to brain-turning appeals to\r\nthe unknown and unendorsed sinner to come forward and enter into the\r\njoy, etc.--\u201cjust as he is\u201d; accustomed to seeing him do it; accustomed\r\nto seeing him pass up the aisle through sobbing seas of welcome, and\r\nlove, and congratulation, and arrive at the mourner's bench and be\r\nreceived like a long-lost government bond.\r\n\r\nNo, there is nothing of that kind in Mrs. Eddy's system. She knows that\r\nif you wish to confer upon a human being something which he is not sure\r\nhe wants, the best way is to make it apparently difficult for him to get\r\nit--then he is no son of Adam if that apple does not assume an interest\r\nin his eyes which it lacked before. In time this interest can grow into\r\ndesire. Mrs. Eddy knows that when you cannot get a man to try--free of\r\ncost--a new and effective remedy for a disease he is afflicted with, you\r\ncan generally sell it to him if you will put a price upon it which he\r\ncannot afford. When, in the beginning, she taught Christian Science\r\ngratis (for good reasons), pupils were few and reluctant, and required\r\npersuasion; it was when she raised the limit to three hundred dollars\r\nfor a dollar's worth that she could not find standing room for the\r\ninvasion of pupils that followed.\r\n\r\nWith fine astuteness she goes through the motions of making it difficult\r\nto get membership in her Church. There is a twofold value in this\r\nsystem: it gives membership a high value in the eyes of the applicant;\r\nand at the same time the requirements exacted enable Mrs. Eddy to keep\r\nhim out if she has doubts about his value to her. A word further as to\r\napplications for membership:\r\n\r\n\u201cApplications of students of the Metaphysical College must be signed by\r\nthe Board of Directors.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat is safe. Mrs. Eddy is proprietor of that Board.\r\n\r\nChildren of twelve may be admitted if invited by \u201cone of Mrs. Eddy's\r\nloyal students, or by a First Member, or by a Director.\u201d\r\n\r\nThese sponsors are the property of Mrs. Eddy, therefore her Church is\r\nsafeguarded from the intrusion of undesirable children.\r\n\r\nOther Students. Applicants who have not studied with Mrs. Eddy can get\r\nin only \u201cby invitation and recommendation from students of Mrs. Eddy....\r\nor from members of the Mother-Church.\u201d\r\n\r\nOther paragraphs explain how two or three other varieties of applicants\r\nare to be challenged and obstructed, and tell us who is authorized to\r\ninvite them, recommend them endorse them, and all that.\r\n\r\nThe safeguards are definite, and would seem to be sufficiently\r\nstrenuous--to Mr. Sam Jones, at any rate. Not for Mrs. Eddy. She adds\r\nthis clincher:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe candidates be elected by a majority vote of the First Members\r\npresent.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat is the aristocracy, the aborigines, the Sanhedrin. It is Mrs.\r\nEddy's property. She herself is the Sanhedrin. No one can get into the\r\nChurch if she wishes to keep him out.\r\n\r\nThis veto power could some time or other have a large value for her,\r\ntherefore she was wise to reserve it.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that it is not frequently used. It is also probable that\r\nthe difficulties attendant upon getting admission to membership have\r\nbeen instituted more to invite than to deter, more to enhance the\r\nvalue of membership and make people long for it than to make it really\r\ndifficult to get. I think so, because the Mother. Church has many\r\nthousands of members more than its building can accommodate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAND SOME ENGLISH REQUIRED\r\n\r\nMrs. Eddy is very particular as regards one detail curiously so, for\r\nher, all things considered. The Church Readers must be \u201cgood English\r\nscholars\u201d; they must be \u201cthorough English scholars.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe is thus sensitive about the English of her subordinates for cause,\r\npossibly. In her chapter defining the duties of the Clerk there is an\r\nindication that she harbors resentful memories of an occasion when the\r\nhazy quality of her own English made unforeseen and mortifying trouble:\r\n\r\n\u201cUnderstanding Communications. Sec. 2. If the Clerk of this Church shall\r\nreceive a communication from the Pastor Emeritus which he does not fully\r\nunderstand, he shall inform her of this fact before presenting it to\r\nthe Church, and obtain a clear understanding of the matter--then act in\r\naccordance therewith.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe should have waited to calm down, then, but instead she added this,\r\nwhich lacks sugar:\r\n\r\n\u201cFailing to adhere to this By-law, the Clerk must resign.\u201d\r\n\r\nI wish I could see that communication that broke the camel's back.\r\nIt was probably the one beginning: \u201cWhat plague spot or bacilli were\r\ngnawing at the heart of this metropolis and bringing it on bended knee?\u201d\r\n and I think it likely that the kindly disposed Clerk tried to translate\r\nit into English and lost his mind and had to go to the hospital.\r\nThat Bylaw was not the offspring of a forecast, an intuition, it was\r\ncertainly born of a sorrowful experience. Its temper gives the fact\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe little book of By-laws has manifestly been tinkered by one of Mrs.\r\nEddy's \u201cthorough English scholars,\u201d for in the majority of cases its\r\nmeanings are clear. The book is not even marred by Mrs. Eddy's peculiar\r\nspecialty--lumbering clumsinesses of speech. I believe the salaried\r\npolisher has weeded them all out but one. In one place, after referring\r\nto Science and Health, Mrs. Eddy goes on to say \u201cthe Bible and the\r\nabove-named book, with other works by the same author,\u201d etc.\r\n\r\nIt is an unfortunate sentence, for it could mislead a hasty or careless\r\nreader for a moment. Mrs. Eddy framed it--it is her very own--it bears\r\nher trade-mark. \u201cThe Bible and Science and Health, with other works by\r\nthe same author,\u201d could have come from no literary vacuum but the one\r\nwhich produced the remark (in the Autobiography): \u201cI remember reading,\r\nin my childhood, certain manuscripts containing Scriptural Sonnets,\r\nbesides other verses and enigmas.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe know what she means, in both instances, but a low-priced Clerk would\r\nnot necessarily know, and on a salary like his he could quite excusably\r\naver that the Pastor Emeritus had commanded him to come and make\r\nproclamation that she was author of the Bible, and that she was thinking\r\nof discharging some Scriptural sonnets and other enigmas upon the\r\ncongregation. It could lose him his place, but it would not be fair, if\r\nit happened before the edict about \u201cUnderstanding Communications\u201d was\r\npromulgated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cREADERS\u201d AGAIN\r\n\r\nThe By-law book makes a showy pretence of orderliness and system, but it\r\nis only a pretence. I will not go so far as to say it is a harum-scarum\r\njumble, for it is not that, but I think it fair to say it is at least\r\njumbulacious in places. For instance, Articles III. and IV. set forth\r\nin much detail the qualifications and duties of Readers, she then\r\nskips some thirty pages and takes up the subject again. It looks\r\nlike slovenliness, but it may be only art. The belated By-law has a\r\nsufficiently quiet look, but it has a ton of dynamite in it. It makes\r\nall the Christian Science Church Readers on the globe the personal\r\nchattels of Mrs. Eddy. Whenever she chooses, she can stretch her long\r\narm around the world's fat belly and flirt a Reader out of his pulpit,\r\nthough he be tucked away in seeming safety and obscurity in a lost\r\nvillage in the middle of China:\r\n\r\n\u201cIn any Church. Sec. 2. The Pastor Emeritus of the Mother-Church shall\r\nhave the right (through a letter addressed to the individual and Church\r\nof which he is the Reader) to remove a Reader from this office in any\r\nChurch of Christ, Scientist, both in America and in foreign nations;\r\nor to appoint the Reader to fill any office belonging to the Christian\r\nScience denomination.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe does not have to prefer charges against him, she does not have to\r\nfind him lazy, careless, incompetent, untidy, ill-mannered, unholy,\r\ndishonest, she does not have to discover a fault of any kind in him,\r\nshe does not have to tell him nor his congregation why she dismisses and\r\ndisgraces him and insults his meek flock, she does not have to explain\r\nto his family why she takes the bread out of their mouths and turns them\r\nout-of-doors homeless and ashamed in a strange land; she does not have\r\nto do anything but send a letter and say: \u201cPack!--and ask no questions!\u201d\r\n\r\nHas the Pope this power?--the other Pope--the one in Rome. Has he\r\nanything approaching it? Can he turn a priest out of his pulpit and\r\nstrip him of his office and his livelihood just upon a whim, a caprice,\r\nand meanwhile furnishing no reasons to the parish? Not in America. And\r\nnot elsewhere, we may believe.\r\n\r\nIt is odd and strange, to see intelligent and educated people among\r\nus worshipping this self-seeking and remorseless tyrant as a God. This\r\nworship is denied--by persons who are themselves worshippers of Mrs.\r\nEddy. I feel quite sure that it is a worship which will continue during\r\nages.\r\n\r\nThat Mrs. Eddy wrote that amazing By-law with her own hand we have much\r\nbetter evidence than her word. We have her English. It is there. It\r\ncannot be imitated. She ought never to go to the expense of copyrighting\r\nher verbal discharges. When any one tries to claim them she should call\r\nme; I can always tell them from any other literary apprentice's at a\r\nglance. It was like her to call America a \u201cnation\u201d; she would call a\r\nsand-bar a nation if it should fall into a sentence in which she was\r\nspeaking of peoples, for she would not know how to untangle it and get\r\nit out and classify it by itself. And the closing arrangement of that\r\nBy-law is in true Eddysonian form, too. In it she reserves authority to\r\nmake a Reader fill any office connected with a Science church-sexton,\r\ngrave-digger, advertising-agent, Annex-polisher, leader of the choir,\r\nPresident, Director, Treasurer, Clerk, etc. She did not mean that.\r\nShe already possessed that authority. She meant to clothe herself with\r\npower, despotic and unchallengeable, to appoint all Science Readers to\r\ntheir offices, both at home and abroad. The phrase \u201cor to appoint\u201d\r\n is another miscarriage of intention; she did not mean \u201cor,\u201d she meant\r\n\u201cand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThat By-law puts into Mrs. Eddy's hands absolute command over the most\r\nformidable force and influence existent in the Christian Science kingdom\r\noutside of herself, and it does this unconditionally and (by auxiliary\r\nforce of Laws already quoted) irrevocably. Still, she is not quite\r\nsatisfied. Something might happen, she doesn't know what. Therefore she\r\ndrives in one more nail, to make sure, and drives it deep:\r\n\r\n\u201cThis By-law can neither be amended nor annulled, except by consent of\r\nthe Pastor Emeritus.\u201d\r\n\r\nLet some one with a wild and delirious fancy try and see if he can\r\nimagine her furnishing that consent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOPOLY OF SPIRITUAL BREAD\r\n\r\nVery properly, the first qualification for membership in the\r\nMother-Church is belief in the doctrines of Christian Science.\r\n\r\nBut these doctrines must not be gathered from secondary sources. There\r\nis but one recognized source. The candidate must be a believer in the\r\ndoctrines of Christian Science \u201caccording to the platform and teaching\r\ncontained in the Christian Science text-book, 'Science and Health, with\r\nKey to the Scriptures,' by Rev. Mary Baker G. Eddy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat is definite, and is final. There are to be no commentaries, no\r\nlabored volumes of exposition and explanation by anybody except Mrs.\r\nEddy. Because such things could sow error, create warring opinions,\r\nsplit the religion into sects, and disastrously cripple its power. Mrs.\r\nEddy will do the whole of the explaining, Herself--has done it, in fact.\r\nShe has written several books. They are to be had (for cash in advance),\r\nthey are all sacred; additions to them can never be needed and will\r\nnever be permitted. They tell the candidate how to instruct himself,\r\nhow to teach others, how to do all things comprised in the business--and\r\nthey close the door against all would-be competitors, and monopolize the\r\ntrade:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Bible and the above--named book [Science and Health], with\r\nother works by the same author,\u201d must be his only text-books for the\r\ncommerce--he cannot forage outside.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eddy's words are to be the sole elucidators of the Bible and\r\nScience and Health--forever. Throughout the ages, whenever there is\r\ndoubt as to the meaning of a passage in either of these books the\r\ninquirer will not dream of trying to explain it to himself; he would\r\nshudder at the thought of such temerity, such profanity, he would be\r\nhaled to the Inquisition and thence to the public square and the stake\r\nif he should be caught studying into text-meanings on his own hook; he\r\nwill be prudent and seek the meanings at the only permitted source, Mrs.\r\nEddy's commentaries.\r\n\r\nValue of this Strait-jacket. One must not underrate the magnificence\r\nof this long-headed idea, one must not underestimate its giant\r\npossibilities in the matter of trooping the Church solidly together and\r\nkeeping it so. It squelches independent inquiry, and makes such a thing\r\nimpossible, profane, criminal, it authoritatively settles every dispute\r\nthat can arise. It starts with finality--a point which the Roman Church\r\nhas travelled towards fifteen or sixteen centuries, stage by stage,\r\nand has not yet reached. The matter of the Immaculate Conception of\r\nthe Virgin Mary was not authoritatively settled until the days of Pius\r\nIX.--yesterday, so to speak.\r\n\r\nAs already noticed, the Protestants are broken up into a long array of\r\nsects, a result of disputes about the meanings of texts, disputes made\r\nunavoidable by the absence of an infallible authority to submit doubtful\r\npassages to. A week or two ago (I am writing in the middle of January,\r\n1903), the clergy and others hereabouts had a warm dispute in the papers\r\nover this question: Did Jesus anywhere claim to be God? It seemed an\r\neasy question, but it turned out to be a hard one. It was ably and\r\nelaborately discussed, by learned men of several denominations, but in\r\nthe end it remained unsettled.\r\n\r\nA week ago, another discussion broke out. It was over this text:\r\n\r\n\u201cSell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne verdict was worded as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen Christ answered the rich young man and said for him to give to the\r\npoor all he possessed or he could not gain everlasting life, He did not\r\nmean it in the literal sense. My interpretation of His words is that we\r\nshould part with what comes between us and Christ.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no doubt that Jesus believed that the rich young man thought\r\nmore of his wealth than he did of his soul, and, such being the case, it\r\nwas his duty to give up the wealth.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery one of us knows that there is something we should give up for\r\nChrist. Those who are true believers and followers know what they have\r\ngiven up, and those who are not yet followers know down in their hearts\r\nwhat they must give up.\u201d\r\n\r\nTen clergymen of various denominations were interviewed, and nine of\r\nthem agreed with that verdict. That did not settle the matter, because\r\nthe tenth said the language of Jesus was so strait and definite that it\r\nexplained itself: \u201cSell all,\u201d not a percentage.\r\n\r\nThere is a most unusual feature about that dispute: the nine persons\r\nwho decided alike, quoted not a single authority in support of their\r\nposition. I do not know when I have seen trained disputants do the like\r\nof that before. The nine merely furnished their own opinions, founded\r\nupon--nothing at all. In the other dispute (\u201cDid Jesus anywhere claim to\r\nbe God?\u201d) the same kind of men--trained and learned clergymen--backed up\r\ntheir arguments with chapter and verse. On both sides. Plenty of verses.\r\nWere no reinforcing verses to be found in the present case? It looks\r\nthat way.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the nine seems strange to me, for it is unsupported\r\nby authority, while there was at least constructive authority for the\r\nopposite view.\r\n\r\nIt is hair-splitting differences of opinion over disputed text-meanings\r\nthat have divided into many sects a once united Church. One may\r\ninfer from some of the names in the following list that some of\r\nthe differences are very slight--so slight as to be not distinctly\r\nimportant, perhaps--yet they have moved groups to withdraw from\r\ncommunions to which they belonged and set up a sect of their own. The\r\nlist--accompanied by various Church statistics for 1902, compiled by\r\nRev. Dr. H. K. Carroll--was published, January 8, 1903, in the New York\r\nChristian Advocate:\r\n\r\nAdventists (6 bodies), Baptists (13 bodies), Brethren (Plymouth) (4\r\nbodies), Brethren (River) (3 bodies), Catholics (8 bodies), Catholic\r\nApostolic, Christadelphians, Christian Connection, Christian Catholics,\r\nChristian Missionary Association, Christian Scientists, Church of God\r\n(Wine-brennarian), Church of the New Jerusalem, Congregationalists,\r\nDisciples of Christ, Dunkards (4 bodies), Evangelical (2 bodies),\r\nFriends (4 bodies), Friends of the Temple, German Evangelical\r\nProtestant, German Evangelical Synod, Independent congregations, Jews (2\r\nbodies), Latter-day Saints (2 bodies), Lutherans (22 bodies), Mennonites\r\n(12 bodies), Methodists (17 bodies), Moravians, Presbyterians (12\r\nbodies), Protestant Episcopal (2 bodies), Reformed (3 bodies),\r\nSchwenkfeldians, Social Brethren, Spiritualists, Swedish Evangelical\r\nMiss. Covenant (Waldenstromians), Unitarians, United Brethren (2\r\nbodies), Universalists.\r\n\r\nTotal of sects and splits--139.\r\n\r\nIn the present month (February), Mr. E. I. Lindh, A.M., has communicated\r\nto the Boston Transcript a hopeful article on the solution of the\r\nproblem of the \u201cdivided church.\u201d Divided is not too violent a term.\r\nSubdivided could have been permitted if he had thought of it. He came\r\nnear thinking of it, for he mentions some of the subdivisions himself:\r\n\u201cthe 12 kinds of Presbyterians, the 17 kinds of Methodists, the 13 kinds\r\nof Baptists, etc.\u201d He overlooked the 12 kinds of Mennonites and the 22\r\nkinds of Lutherans, but they are in Rev. Mr. Carroll's list. Altogether,\r\n76 splits under 5 flags. The Literary Digest (February 14th) is pleased\r\nwith Mr. Lindh's optimistic article, and also with the signs of the\r\ntimes, and perceives that \u201cthe idea of Church unity is in the air.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow, then, is not Mrs. Eddy profoundly wise in forbidding, for all time,\r\nall explanations of her religion except such as she shall let on to be\r\nher own?\r\n\r\nI think so. I think there can be no doubt of it. In a way, they will be\r\nher own; for, no matter which member of her clerical staff shall furnish\r\nthe explanations, not a line of them will she ever allow to be printed\r\nuntil she shall have approved it, accepted it, copyrighted it, cabbaged\r\nit. We may depend on that with a four-ace confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW INFALLIBILITY\r\n\r\nAll in proper time Mrs. Eddy's factory will take hold of that\r\nCommandment, and explain it for good and all. It may be that one member\r\nof the shift will vote that the word \u201call\u201d means all; it may be that ten\r\nmembers of the shift will vote that \u201call\u201d means only a percentage; but\r\nit is Mrs. Eddy, not the eleven, who will do the deciding. And if she\r\nsays it is percentage, then percentage it is, forevermore--and that\r\nis what I am expecting, for she doesn't sell all herself, nor any\r\nconsiderable part of it, and as regards the poor, she doesn't declare\r\nany dividend; but if she says \u201call\u201d means all, then all it is, to the\r\nend of time, and no follower of hers will ever be allowed to reconstruct\r\nthat text, or shrink it, or inflate it, or meddle with it in any way at\r\nall. Even to-day--right here in the beginning--she is the sole person\r\nwho, in the matter of Christian Science exegesis, is privileged to\r\nexploit the Spiral Twist. The Christian world has two Infallibles now.\r\n\r\nOf equal power? For the present only. When Leo XIII. passes to his rest\r\nanother Infallible will ascend his throne; others, and yet others, and\r\nstill others will follow him, and be as infallible as he, and decide\r\nquestions of doctrine as long as they may come up, all down the far\r\nfuture; but Mary Baker G. Eddy is the only Infallible that will ever\r\noccupy the Science throne. Many a Science Pope will succeed her, but\r\nshe has closed their mouths; they will repeat and reverently praise and\r\nadore her infallibilities, but venture none themselves. In her grave she\r\nwill still outrank all other Popes, be they of what Church they may.\r\nShe will hold the supremest of earthly titles, The Infallible--with\r\na capital T. Many in the world's history have had a hunger for such\r\nnuggets and slices of power as they might reasonably hope to grab out\r\nof an empire's or a religion's assets, but Mrs. Eddy is the only person\r\nalive or dead who has ever struck for the whole of them. For small\r\nthings she has the eye of a microscope, for large ones the eye of a\r\ntelescope, and whatever she sees, she wants. Wants it all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SACRED POEMS\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Eddy's \u201csacred revelations\u201d (that is the language of the\r\nBy-laws) are read in public, their authorship must be named. The By-laws\r\ntwice command this, therefore we mention it twice, to be fair.\r\n\r\nBut it is also commanded that when a member publicly quotes \u201cfrom the\r\npoems of our Pastor Emeritus\u201d the authorship shall be named. For these\r\nare sacred, too. There are kindly people who may suspect a hidden\r\ngenerosity in that By-law; they may think it is there to protect the\r\nOfficial Reader from the suspicion of having written the poems himself.\r\nSuch do not know Mrs. Eddy. She does an inordinate deal of protecting,\r\nbut in no distinctly named and specified case in her history has Number\r\nTwo been the object of it. Instances have been claimed, but they have\r\nfailed of proof, and even of plausibility.\r\n\r\n\u201cMembers shall also instruct their students\u201d to look out and advertise\r\nthe authorship when they read those poems and things. Not on Mrs. Eddy's\r\naccount, but \u201cfor the good of our Cause.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH EDIFICE\r\n\r\n1. Mrs. Eddy gave the land. It was not of much value at the time, but it\r\nis very valuable now. 2. Her people built the Mother-Church edifice on\r\nit, at a cost of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 3. Then they\r\ngave the whole property to her. 4. Then she gave it to the Board of\r\nDirectors. She is the Board of Directors. She took it out of one pocket\r\nand put it in the other. 5. Sec. 10 (of the deed). \u201cWhenever said\r\nDirectors shall determine that it is inexpedient to maintain preaching,\r\nreading, or speaking in said church in accordance with the terms of this\r\ndeed, they are authorized and required to reconvey forthwith said lot\r\nof land with the building thereon to Mary Baker G. Eddy, her heirs and\r\nassigns forever, by a proper deed of conveyance.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe is never careless, never slipshod, about a matter of business.\r\nOwning the property through her Board of Waxworks was safe enough, still\r\nit was sound business to set another grip on it to cover accidents,\r\nand she did it. Her barkers (what a curious name; I wonder if it is\r\ncopyrighted); her barkers persistently advertise to the public her\r\ngenerosity in giving away a piece of land which cost her a trifle, and\r\na two--hundred--and--fifty--thousand--dollar church which cost her\r\nnothing; and they can hardly speak of the unselfishness of it without\r\nbreaking down and crying; yet they know she gave nothing away, and never\r\nintended to. However, such is the human race. Often it does seem such a\r\npity that Noah and his party did not miss the boat.\r\n\r\nSome of the hostiles think that Mrs. Eddy's idea in protecting this\r\nproperty in the interest of her heirs, and in accumulating a great money\r\nfortune, is, that she may leave her natural heirs well provided for when\r\nshe goes. I think it is a mistake. I think she is of late years giving\r\nherself large concern about only one interest-her power and glory, and\r\nthe perpetuation and worship of her Name--with a capital N. Her Church\r\nis her pet heir, and I think it will get her wealth. It is the torch\r\nwhich is to light the world and the ages with her glory.\r\n\r\nI think she once prized money for the ease and comfort it could bring,\r\nthe showy vanities it could furnish, and the social promotion it could\r\ncommand; for we have seen that she was born into the world with little\r\nways and instincts and aspirations and affectations that are duplicates\r\nof our own. I do not think her money-passion has ever diminished in\r\nferocity, I do not think that she has ever allowed a dollar that had no\r\nfriends to get by her alive, but I think her reason for wanting it\r\nhas changed. I think she wants it now to increase and establish and\r\nperpetuate her power and glory with, not to add to her comforts and\r\nluxuries, not to furnish paint and fuss and feathers for vain display.\r\nI think her ambitions have soared away above the fuss-and-feather stage.\r\nShe still likes the little shows and vanities--a fact which she\r\nexposed in a public utterance two or three days ago when she was not\r\nnoticing--but I think she does not place a large value upon them now.\r\nShe could build a mighty and far-shining brass-mounted palace if she\r\nwanted to, but she does not do it. She would have had that kind of an\r\nambition in the early scrabbling times. She could go to England to-day\r\nand be worshiped by earls, and get a comet's attention from the\r\nmillion, if she cared for such things. She would have gone in the early\r\nscrabbling days for much less than an earl, and been vain of it, and\r\nglad to show off before the remains of the Scotch kin. But those things\r\nare very small to her now--next to invisible, observed through the\r\ncloud-rack from the dizzy summit where she perches in these great days.\r\nShe does not want that church property for herself. It is worth but a\r\nquarter of a million--a sum she could call in from her far-spread flocks\r\nto-morrow with a lift of her hand. Not a squeeze of it, just a lift. It\r\nwould come without a murmur; come gratefully, come gladly. And if her\r\nglory stood in more need of the money in Boston than it does where her\r\nflocks are propagating it, she would lift the hand, I think.\r\n\r\nShe is still reaching for the Dollar, she will continue to reach for it;\r\nbut not that she may spend it upon herself; not that she may spend it\r\nupon charities; not that she may indemnify an early deprivation and\r\nclothe herself in a blaze of North Adams gauds; not that she may have\r\nnine breeds of pie for breakfast, as only the rich New-Englander can;\r\nnot that she may indulge any petty material vanity or appetite that once\r\nwas hers and prized and nursed, but that she may apply that Dollar to\r\nstatelier uses, and place it where it may cast the metallic sheen of her\r\nglory farthest across the receding expanses of the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAYER\r\n\r\nA brief and good one is furnished in the book of By-laws. The Scientist\r\nis required to pray it every day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LORD'S PRAYER-AMENDED\r\n\r\nThis is not in the By-laws, it is in the first chapter of Science and\r\nHealth, edition of 1902. I do not find it in the edition of 1884. It\r\nis probable that it had not at that time been handed down. Science and\r\nHealth's (latest) rendering of its \u201cspiritual sense\u201d is as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201cOur Father-Mother God' all-harmonious, adorable One. Thy kingdom is\r\nwithin us, Thou art ever-present. Enable us to know--as in heaven, so\r\non earth--God is supreme. Give us grace for to-day; feed the famished\r\naffections. And infinite Love is reflected in love. And Love leadeth us\r\nnot into temptation, but delivereth from sin, disease, and death. For\r\nGod is now and forever all Life, Truth, and Love.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf I thought my opinion was desired and would be properly revered, I\r\nshould say that in my judgment that is as good a piece of carpentering\r\nas any of those eleven Commandment--experts could do with the material\r\nafter all their practice. I notice only one doubtful place. \u201cLead us not\r\ninto temptation\u201d seems to me to be a very definite request, and that the\r\nnew rendering turns the definite request into a definite assertion. I\r\nshall be glad to have that turned back to the old way and the marks of\r\nthe Spiral Twist removed, or varnished over; then I shall be satisfied,\r\nand will do the best I can with what is left. At the same time, I do\r\nfeel that the shrinkage in our spiritual assets is getting serious.\r\nFirst the Commandments, now the Prayer. I never expected to see these\r\nsteady old reliable securities watered down to this. And this is not\r\nthe whole of it. Last summer the Presbyterians extended the Calling and\r\nElection suffrage to nearly everybody entitled to salvation. They did\r\nnot even stop there, but let out all the unbaptized American infants\r\nwe had been accumulating for two hundred years and more. There are some\r\nthat believe they would have let the Scotch ones out, too, if they could\r\nhave done it. Everything is going to ruin; in no long time we shall have\r\nnothing left but the love of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW UNPARDONABLE SIN\r\n\r\n\u201cWorking Against the Cause. Sec. 2. If a member of this Church shall\r\nwork against the accomplishment of what the Discoverer and Founder of\r\nChristian Science understands is advantageous to the individual, to this\r\nChurch, and to the Cause of Christian Science\u201d--out he goes. Forever.\r\n\r\nThe member may think that what he is doing will advance the Cause,\r\nbut he is not invited to do any thinking. More than that, he is not\r\npermitted to do any--as he will clearly gather from this By-law. When a\r\nperson joins Mrs. Eddy's Church he must leave his thinker at home. Leave\r\nit permanently. To make sure that it will not go off some time or other\r\nwhen he is not watching, it will be safest for him to spike it. If he\r\nshould forget himself and think just once, the By-law provides that he\r\nshall be fired out-instantly-forever-no return.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt shall be the duty of this Church immediately to call a meeting, and\r\ndrop forever the name of this member from its records.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy, but it breathes a towering indignation!\r\n\r\nThere are forgivable offenses, but this is not one of them; there are\r\nadmonitions, probations, suspensions, in several minor cases; mercy is\r\nshown the derelict, in those cases he is gently used, and in time he can\r\nget back into the fold--even when he has repeated his offence. But let\r\nhim think, just once, without getting his thinker set to Eddy time,\r\nand that is enough; his head comes off. There is no second offence, and\r\nthere is no gate open to that lost sheep, ever again.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis rule cannot be changed, amended, or annulled, except by unanimous\r\nvote of all the First Members.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe same being Mrs. Eddy. It is naively sly and pretty to see her keep\r\nputting forward First Members, and Boards of This and That, and other\r\nbroideries and ruffles of her raiment, as if they were independent\r\nentities, instead of a part of her clothes, and could do things all by\r\nthemselves when she was outside of them.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eddy did not need to copyright the sentence just quoted, its\r\nEnglish would protect it. None but she would have shovelled that\r\ncomically superfluous \u201call\u201d in there.\r\n\r\nThe former Unpardonable Sin has gone out of service. We may frame the\r\nnew Christian Science one thus:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhatsoever Member shall think, and without Our Mother's permission act\r\nupon his think, the same shall be cut off from the Church forever.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt has been said that I make many mistakes about Christian Science\r\nthrough being ignorant of the spiritual meanings of its terminology.\r\nI believe it is true. I have been misled all this time by that word\r\nMember, because there was no one to tell me that its spiritual meaning\r\nwas Slave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAXE AND BLOCK\r\n\r\nThere is a By-law which forbids Members to practice hypnotism; the\r\npenalty is excommunication.\r\n\r\n1. If a member is found to be a mental practitioner--2. Complaint is to\r\nbe entered against him--3. By the Pastor Emeritus, and by none else;\r\n4. No member is allowed to make complaint to her in the matter; 5. Upon\r\nMrs. Eddy's mere \u201ccomplaint\u201d--unbacked by evidence or proof, and without\r\ngiving the accused a chance to be heard--his name shall be dropped from\r\nthis Church.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eddy has only to say a member is guilty--that is all. That ends\r\nit. It is not a case of he \u201cmay\u201d be cut off from Christian Science\r\nsalvation, it is a case of he \u201cshall\u201d be. Her serfs must see to it, and\r\nnot say a word.\r\n\r\nDoes the other Pope possess this prodigious and irresponsible power?\r\nCertainly not in our day.\r\n\r\nSome may be curious to know how Mrs. Eddy finds out that a member is\r\npracticing hypnotism, since no one is allowed to come before her throne\r\nand accuse him. She has explained this in Christian Science History,\r\nfirst and second editions, page 16:\r\n\r\n\u201cI possess a spiritual sense of what the malicious mental practitioner\r\nis mentally arguing which cannot be deceived; I can discern in the human\r\nmind thoughts, motives, and purposes, and neither mental arguments nor\r\npsychic power can affect this spiritual insight.\u201d\r\n\r\nA marvelous woman; with a hunger for power such as has never been seen\r\nin the world before. No thing, little or big, that contains any seed or\r\nsuggestion of power escapes her avaricious eye; and when once she gets\r\nthat eye on it, her remorseless grip follows. There isn't a Christian\r\nScientist who isn't ecclesiastically as much her property as if she had\r\nbought him and paid for him, and copyrighted him and got a charter.\r\nShe cannot be satisfied when she has handcuffed a member, and put a\r\nleg-chain and ball on him and plugged his ears and removed his thinker,\r\nshe goes on wrapping needless chains round and round him, just as a\r\nspider would. For she trusts no one, believes in no one's honesty,\r\njudges every one by herself. Although we have seen that she has absolute\r\nand irresponsible command over her spectral Boards and over every\r\nofficial and servant of her Church, at home and abroad, over every\r\nminute detail of her Church's government, present and future, and can\r\npurge her membership of guilty or suspected persons by various plausible\r\nformalities and whenever she will, she is still not content, but must\r\nset her queer mind to work and invent a way by which she can take a\r\nmember--any member--by neck and crop and fling him out without anything\r\nresembling a formality at all.\r\n\r\nShe is sole accuser and sole witness, and her testimony is final and\r\ncarries uncompromising and irremediable doom with it.\r\n\r\nThe Sole-Witness Court! It should make the Council of Ten and the\r\nCouncil of Three turn in their graves for shame, to see how little they\r\nknew about satanic concentrations of irresponsible power. Here we have\r\none Accuser, one Witness, one Judge, one Headsman--and all four bunched\r\ntogether in Mrs. Eddy, the Inspired of God, His Latest Thought to His\r\nPeople, New Member of the Holy Family, the Equal of Jesus.\r\n\r\nWhen a Member is not satisfactory to Mrs. Eddy, and yet is blameless in\r\nhis life and faultless in his membership and in his Christian Science\r\nwalk and conversation, shall he hold up his head and tilt his hat over\r\none ear and imagine himself safe because of these perfections? Why,\r\nin that very moment Mrs. Eddy will cast that spiritual X-ray of hers\r\nthrough his dungarees and say:\r\n\r\n\u201cI see his hypnotism working, among his insides--remove him to the\r\nblock!\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat shall it profit him to know it isn't so? Nothing. His testimony is\r\nof no value. No one wants it, no one will ask for it. He is not present\r\nto offer it (he does not know he has been accused), and if he were there\r\nto offer it, it would not be listened to.\r\n\r\nIt was out of powers approaching Mrs. Eddy's--though not equalling\r\nthem--that the Inquisition and the devastations of the Interdict grew.\r\nShe will transmit hers. The man born two centuries from now will think\r\nhe has arrived in hell; and all in good time he will think he knows it.\r\nVast concentrations of irresponsible power have never in any age been\r\nused mercifully, and there is nothing to suggest that the Christian\r\nScience Papacy is going to spend money on novelties.\r\n\r\nSeveral Christian Scientists have asked me to refrain from prophecy.\r\nThere is no prophecy in our day but history. But history is a\r\ntrustworthy prophet. History is always repeating itself, because\r\nconditions are always repeating themselves. Out of duplicated conditions\r\nhistory always gets a duplicate product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING LETTERS AT MEETINGS\r\n\r\nI wonder if there is anything a Member can do that will not raise Mrs.\r\nEddy's jealousy? The By-laws seem to hunt him from pillar to post all\r\nthe time, and turn all his thoughts and acts and words into sins against\r\nthe meek and lowly new deity of his worship. Apparently her jealousy\r\nnever sleeps. Apparently any trifle can offend it, and but one penalty\r\nappease it--excommunication. The By-laws might properly and reasonably\r\nbe entitled Laws for the Coddling and Comforting of Our Mother's Petty\r\nJealousies. The By-law named at the head of this paragraph reads its\r\ntransgressor out of the Church if he shall carry a letter from Mrs. Eddy\r\nto the congregation and forget to read it or fail to read the whole of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHONESTY REQUISITE\r\n\r\nDishonest members are to be admonished; if they continue in dishonest\r\npractices, excommunication follows. Considering who it is that draughted\r\nthis law, there is a certain amount of humor in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER APPLICATIONS OF THE AXE\r\n\r\nHere follow the titles of some more By-laws whose infringement is\r\npunishable by excommunication:\r\n\r\n\r\nSilence Enjoined. Misteaching. Departure from Tenets. Violation of\r\nChristian Fellowship. Moral Offences. Illegal Adoption. Broken By-laws.\r\nViolation of By-laws. (What is the difference?) Formulas Forbidden.\r\nOfficial Advice. (Forbids Tom, Dick, and Harry's clack.) Unworthy of\r\nMembership. Final Excommunication. Organizing Churches.\r\n\r\nThis looks as if Mrs. Eddy had devoted a large share of her time and\r\ntalent to inventing ways to get rid of her Church members. Yet in\r\nanother place she seems to invite membership. Not in any urgent way,\r\nit is true, still she throws out a bait to such as like notice and\r\ndistinction (in other words, the Human Race). Page 82:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is important that these seemingly strict conditions be complied\r\nwith, as the names of the Members of the Mother-Church will be recorded\r\nin the history of the Church and become a part thereof.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe all want to be historical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE SELF-PROTECTIONS\r\n\r\nThe Hymnal. There is a Christian Science Hymnal. Entrance to it was\r\nclosed in 1898. Christian Science students who make hymns nowadays may\r\npossibly get them sung in the Mother-Church, \u201cbut not unless approved by\r\nthe Pastor Emeritus.\u201d Art. XXVII, Sec. 2.\r\n\r\nSolo Singers. Mrs. Eddy has contributed the words of three of the hymns\r\nin the Hymnal. Two of them appear in it six times altogether, each of\r\nthem being set to three original forms of musical anguish. Mrs. Eddy,\r\nalways thoughtful, has promulgated a By-law requiring the singing of one\r\nof her three hymns in the Mother Church \u201cas often as once each month.\u201d\r\n It is a good idea. A congregation could get tired of even Mrs. Eddy's\r\nmuse in the course of time, without the cordializing incentive of\r\ncompulsion. We all know how wearisome the sweetest and touchingest\r\nthings can become, through rep-rep-repetition, and still\r\nrep-rep-repetition, and more rep-rep-repetition-like \u201cthe sweet\r\nby-and-by, in the sweet by-and-by,\u201d for instance, and \u201cTah-rah-rah\r\nboom-de-aye\u201d; and surely it is not likely that Mrs. Eddy's machine has\r\nturned out goods that could outwear those great heart-stirrers, without\r\nthe assistance of the lash. \u201cO'er Waiting Harpstrings of the Mind\u201d is\r\npretty good, quite fair to middling--the whole seven of the stanzas--but\r\nrepetition would be certain to take the excitement out of it in the\r\ncourse of time, even if there were fourteen, and then it would sound\r\nlike the multiplication table, and would cease to save. The congregation\r\nwould be perfectly sure to get tired; in fact, did get tired--hence the\r\ncompulsory By-law. It is a measure born of experience, not foresight.\r\n\r\nThe By-laws say that \u201cif a solo singer shall neglect or refuse to sing\r\nalone\u201d one of those three hymns as often as once a month, and oftener if\r\nso directed by the Board of Directors--which is Mrs. Eddy--the singer's\r\nsalary shall be stopped. It is circumstantial evidence that some\r\nsoloists neglected this sacrament and others refused it. At least that\r\nis the charitable view to take of it. There is only one other view to\r\ntake: that Mrs. Eddy did really foresee that there would be singers\r\nwho would some day get tired of doing her hymns and proclaiming the\r\nauthorship, unless persuaded by a Bylaw, with a penalty attached. The\r\nidea could of course occur to her wise head, for she would know that a\r\nseven-stanza break might well be a calamitous strain upon a soloist, and\r\nthat he might therefore avoid it if unwatched. He could not curtail it,\r\nfor the whole of anything that Mrs. Eddy does is sacred, and cannot be\r\ncut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOARD OF EDUCATION\r\n\r\nIt consists of four members, one of whom is President of it. Its members\r\nare elected annually. Subject to Mrs. Eddy's approval. Art. XXX., Sec.\r\n2.\r\n\r\nShe owns the Board--is the Board.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eddy is President of the Metaphysical College. If at any time she\r\nshall vacate that office, the Directors of the College (that is to say,\r\nMrs. Eddy) \u201cshall\u201d elect to the vacancy the President of the Board of\r\nEducation (which is merely re-electing herself).\r\n\r\nIt is another case of \u201cPastor Emeritus.\u201d She gives up the shadow of\r\nauthority, but keeps a good firm hold on the substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC TEACHERS\r\n\r\nApplicants for admission to this industry must pass a thorough three\r\ndays' examination before the Board of Education \u201cin Science and Health,\r\nchapter on 'Recapitulation'; the Platform of Christian Science; page 403\r\nof Christian Science Practice, from line second to the second paragraph\r\nof page 405; and page 488, second and third paragraphs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOARD OF LECTURESHIP\r\n\r\nThe lecturers are exceedingly important servants of Mrs. Eddy, and she\r\nchooses them with great care. Each of them has an appointed territory\r\nin which to perform his duties--in the North, the South, the East, the\r\nWest, in Canada, in Great Britain, and so on--and each must stick to\r\nhis own territory and not forage beyond its boundaries. I think it goes\r\nwithout saying--from what we have seen of Mrs. Eddy--that no lecture is\r\ndelivered until she has examined and approved it, and that the lecturer\r\nis not allowed to change it afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Board of Lectureship are elected annually--\r\n\r\n\u201cSubject to the approval of Rev. Mary Baker G. Eddy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSIONARIES\r\n\r\nThere are but four. They are elected--like the rest of the\r\ndomestics--annually. So far as I can discover, not a single servant of\r\nthe Sacred Household has a steady job except Mrs. Eddy. It is plain that\r\nshe trusts no human being but herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BY-LAWS\r\n\r\nThe branch Churches are strictly forbidden to use them.\r\n\r\nSo far as I can see, they could not do it if they wanted to. The By-laws\r\nare merely the voice of the master issuing commands to the servants.\r\nThere is nothing and nobody for the servants to re-utter them to.\r\n\r\nThat useless edict is repeated in the little book, a few pages farther\r\non. There are several other repetitions of prohibitions in the book that\r\ncould be spared-they only take up room for nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CREED It is copyrighted. I do not know why, but I suppose it is to\r\nkeep adventurers from some day claiming that they invented it, and\r\nnot Mrs. Eddy and that \u201cstrange Providence\u201d that has suggested so many\r\nclever things to her.\r\n\r\nNo Change. It is forbidden to change the Creed. That is important, at\r\nany rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT\r\n\r\nI can understand why Mrs. Eddy copyrighted the early editions\r\nand revisions of Science and Health, and why she had a mania for\r\ncopyrighting every scrap of every sort that came from her pen in those\r\njejune days when to be in print probably seemed a wonderful distinction\r\nto her in her provincial obscurity, but why she should continue this\r\ndelirium in these days of her godship and her far-spread fame, I cannot\r\nexplain to myself. And particularly as regards Science and Health. She\r\nknows, now, that that Annex is going to live for many centuries; and so,\r\nwhat good is a fleeting forty-two-year copyright going to do it?\r\n\r\nNow a perpetual copyright would be quite another matter. I would like to\r\ngive her a hint. Let her strike for a perpetual copyright on that book.\r\nThere is precedent for it. There is one book in the world which bears\r\nthe charmed life of perpetual copyright (a fact not known to twenty\r\npeople in the world). By a hardy perversion of privilege on the part of\r\nthe lawmaking power the Bible has perpetual copyright in Great Britain.\r\nThere is no justification for it in fairness, and no explanation of it\r\nexcept that the Church is strong enough there to have its way, right\r\nor wrong. The recent Revised Version enjoys perpetual copyright, too--a\r\nstronger precedent, even, than the other one.\r\n\r\nNow, then, what is the Annex but a Revised Version itself? Which of\r\ncourse it is--Lord's Prayer and all. With that pair of formidable\r\nBritish precedents to proceed upon, what Congress of ours--\r\n\r\nBut how short-sighted I am. Mrs. Eddy has thought of it long ago. She\r\nthinks of everything. She knows she has only to keep her copyright of\r\n1902 alive through its first stage of twenty-eight years, and perpetuity\r\nis assured. A Christian Science Congress will reign in the Capitol then.\r\nShe probably attaches small value to the first edition (1875). Although\r\nit was a Revelation from on high, it was slim, lank, incomplete, padded\r\nwith bales of refuse rags, and puffs from lassoed celebrities to fill\r\nit out, an uncreditable book, a book easily sparable, a book not to\r\nbe mentioned in the same year with the sleek, fat, concise, compact,\r\ncompressed, and competent Annex of to-day, in its dainty flexible\r\ncovers, gilt--edges, rounded corners, twin screw, spiral twist,\r\ncompensation balance, Testament-counterfeit, and all that; a book just\r\nborn to curl up on the hymn-book-shelf in church and look just too sweet\r\nand holy for anything. Yes, I see now what she was copyrighting that\r\nchild for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\nIt is true in matters of business Mrs. Eddy thinks of everything. She\r\nthought of an organ, to disseminate the Truth as it was in Mrs. Eddy.\r\nStraightway she started one--the Christian Science Journal.\r\n\r\nIt is true--in matters of business Mrs. Eddy thinks of everything. As\r\nsoon as she had got the Christian Science Journal sufficiently in debt\r\nto make its presence on the premises disagreeable to her, it occurred\r\nto her to make somebody a present of it. Which she did, along with\r\nits debts. It was in the summer of 1889. The victim selected was\r\nher Church--called, in those days, The National Christian Scientist\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nShe delivered this sorrow to those lambs as a \u201cgift\u201d in consideration of\r\ntheir \u201cloyalty to our great cause.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlso--still thinking of everything--she told them to retain Mr. Bailey\r\nin the editorship and make Mr. Nixon publisher. We do not know what it\r\nwas she had against those men; neither do we know whether she scored on\r\nBailey or not, we only know that God protected Nixon, and for that I am\r\nsincerely glad, although I do not know Nixon and have never even seen\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNixon took the Journal and the rest of the Publishing Society's\r\nliabilities, and demonstrated over them during three years, then brought\r\nin his report:\r\n\r\n\u201cOn assuming my duties as publisher, there was not a dollar in the\r\ntreasury; but on the contrary the Society owed unpaid printing and\r\npaper bills to the amount of several hundred dollars, not to mention\r\na contingent liability of many more hundreds\u201d--represented by\r\nadvance--subscriptions paid for the Journal and the \u201cSeries,\u201d the which\r\ngoods Mrs. Eddy had not delivered. And couldn't, very well, perhaps, on\r\na Metaphysical College income of but a few thousand dollars a day, or a\r\nweek, or whatever it was in those magnificently flourishing times. The\r\nstruggling Journal had swallowed up those advance-payments, but its\r\n\u201cclaim\u201d was a severe one and they had failed to cure it. But Nixon cured\r\nit in his diligent three years, and joyously reported the news that he\r\nhad cleared off all the debts and now had a fat six thousand dollars in\r\nthe bank.\r\n\r\nIt made Mrs. Eddy's mouth water.\r\n\r\nAt the time that Mrs. Eddy had unloaded that dismal gift on to her\r\nNational Association, she had followed her inveterate custom: she had\r\ntied a string to its hind leg, and kept one end of it hitched to her\r\nbelt. We have seen her do that in the case of the Boston Mosque. When\r\nshe deeds property, she puts in that string-clause. It provides that\r\nunder certain conditions she can pull the string and land the property\r\nin the cherished home of its happy youth. In the present case she\r\nbelieved that she had made provision that if at any time the National\r\nChristian Science Association should dissolve itself by a formal vote,\r\nshe could pull.\r\n\r\nA year after Nixon's handsome report, she writes the Association that\r\nshe has a \u201cunique request to lay before it.\u201d It has dissolved, and she\r\nis not quite sure that the Christian Science Journal has \u201calready fallen\r\ninto her hands\u201d by that act, though it \u201cseems\u201d to her to have met with\r\nthat accident; so she would like to have the matter decided by a formal\r\nvote. But whether there is a doubt or not, \u201cI see the wisdom,\u201d she says,\r\n\u201cof again owning this Christian Science waif.\u201d\r\n\r\nI think that that is unassailable evidence that the waif was making\r\nmoney, hands down.\r\n\r\nShe pulled her gift in. A few years later she donated the Publishing\r\nSociety, along with its real estate, its buildings, its plant, its\r\npublications, and its money--the whole worth twenty--two thousand\r\ndollars, and free of debt--to--Well, to the Mother-Church!\r\n\r\nThat is to say, to herself. There is an account of it in the Christian\r\nScience Journal, and of how she had already made some other handsome\r\ngifts--to her Church--and others to--to her Cause besides \u201can almost\r\ncountless number of private charities\u201d of cloudy amount and otherwise\r\nindefinite. This landslide of generosities overwhelmed one of her\r\nliterary domestics. While he was in that condition he tried to express\r\nwhat he felt:\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us endeavor to lift up our hearts in thankfulness to... our Mother\r\nin Israel for these evidences of generosity and self-sacrifice that\r\nappeal to our deepest sense of gratitude, even while surpassing our\r\ncomprehension.\u201d\r\n\r\nA year or two later, Mrs. Eddy promulgated some By-laws of a\r\nself-sacrificing sort which assuaged him, perhaps, and perhaps enabled\r\nhis surpassed comprehension to make a sprint and catch up. These are to\r\nbe found in Art. XII., entitled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING SOCIETY\r\n\r\nThis Article puts the whole publishing business into the hands of a\r\npublishing Board--special. Mrs. Eddy appoints to its vacancies.\r\n\r\nThe profits go semi-annually to the Treasurer of the Mother-Church. Mrs.\r\nEddy owns the Treasurer.\r\n\r\nEditors and publishers of the Christian Science Journal cannot be\r\nelected or removed without Mrs. Eddy's knowledge and consent.\r\n\r\nEvery candidate for employment in a high capacity or a low one, on the\r\nother periodicals or in the publishing house, must first be \u201caccepted\r\nby Mrs. Eddy as suitable.\u201d And \u201cby the Board of Directors\u201d--which is\r\nsurplusage, since Mrs. Eddy owns the Board.\r\n\r\nIf at any time a weekly shall be started, \u201cit shall be owned by The\r\nFirst Church of Christ, Scientist\u201d--which is Mrs. Eddy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nI think that any one who will carefully examine the By-laws (I have\r\nplaced all of the important ones before the reader), will arrive at the\r\nconclusion that of late years the master-passion in Mrs. Eddy's heart is\r\na hunger for power and glory; and that while her hunger for money still\r\nremains, she wants it now for the expansion and extension it can furnish\r\nto that power and glory, rather than what it can do for her towards\r\nsatisfying minor and meaner ambitions.\r\n\r\nI wish to enlarge a little upon this matter. I think it is quite clear\r\nthat the reason why Mrs. Eddy has concentrated in herself all powers,\r\nall distinctions, all revenues that are within the command of the\r\nChristian Science Church Universal is that she desires and intends\r\nto devote them to the purpose just suggested--the upbuilding of her\r\npersonal glory--hers, and no one else's; that, and the continuing of her\r\nname's glory after she shall have passed away. If she has overlooked a\r\nsingle power, howsoever minute, I cannot discover it. If she has found\r\none, large or small, which she has not seized and made her own, there is\r\nno record of it, no trace of it. In her foragings and depredations she\r\nusually puts forward the Mother-Church--a lay figure--and hides behind\r\nit. Whereas, she is in manifest reality the Mother-Church herself. It\r\nhas an impressive array of officials, and committees, and Boards of\r\nDirection, of Education, of Lectureship, and so on--geldings, every one,\r\nshadows, spectres, apparitions, wax-figures: she is supreme over them\r\nall, she can abolish them when she will; blow them out as she would a\r\ncandle. She is herself the Mother-Church. Now there is one By-law which\r\nsays that the Mother-Church:\r\n\r\n\u201cshall be officially controlled by no other church.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat does not surprise us--we know by the rest of the By-laws that that\r\nis a quite irrelevant remark. Yet we do vaguely and hazily wonder why\r\nshe takes the trouble to say it; why she wastes the words; what her\r\nobject can be--seeing that that emergency has been in so many, many\r\nways, and so effectively and drastically barred off and made impossible.\r\nThen presently the object begins to dawn upon us. That is, it does after\r\nwe have read the rest of the By-law three or four times, wondering\r\nand admiring to see Mrs. Eddy--Mrs. Eddy--Mrs. Eddy, of all\r\npersons--throwing away power!--making a fair exchange--doing a fair\r\nthing for once more, an almost generous thing! Then we look it through\r\nyet once more unsatisfied, a little suspicious--and find that it is\r\nnothing but a sly, thin make-believe, and that even the very title of it\r\nis a sarcasm and embodies a falsehood--\u201cself\u201d government:\r\n\r\n\u201cLocal Self-Government. The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in\r\nBoston, Massachusetts, shall assume no official control of other\r\nchurches of this denomination. It shall be officially controlled by no\r\nother church.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt has a most pious and deceptive give-and-take air of perfect fairness,\r\nunselfishness, magnanimity--almost godliness, indeed. But it is all art.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the By-laws, Mrs. Eddy, speaking by the mouth of her other self, the\r\nMother-Church, proclaims that she will assume no official control of\r\nother churches-branch churches. We examine the other By-laws, and they\r\nanswer some important questions for us:\r\n\r\n1. What is a branch Church? It is a body of Christian Scientists,\r\norganized in the one and only permissible way--by a member, in good\r\nstanding, of the Mother-Church, and who is also a pupil of one of Mrs.\r\nEddy's accredited students. That is to say, one of her properties. No\r\nother can do it. There are other indispensable requisites; what are\r\nthey?\r\n\r\n2. The new Church cannot enter upon its functions until its members have\r\nindividually signed, and pledged allegiance to, a Creed furnished by\r\nMrs. Eddy.\r\n\r\n3. They are obliged to study her books, and order their lives by them.\r\nAnd they must read no outside religious works.\r\n\r\n4. They must sing the hymns and pray the prayers provided by her, and\r\nuse no others in the services, except by her permission.\r\n\r\n5. They cannot have preachers and pastors. Her law.\r\n\r\n6. In their Church they must have two Readers--a man and a woman.\r\n\r\n7. They must read the services framed and appointed by her.\r\n\r\n8. She--not the branch Church--appoints those Readers.\r\n\r\n9. She--not the branch Church--dismisses them and fills the vacancies.\r\n\r\n10. She can do this without consulting the branch Church, and without\r\nexplaining.\r\n\r\n11. The branch Church can have a religious lecture from time to time. By\r\napplying to Mrs. Eddy. There is no other way.\r\n\r\n12. But the branch Church cannot select the lecturer. Mrs. Eddy does it.\r\n\r\n13. The branch Church pays his fee.\r\n\r\n14. The harnessing of all Christian Science wedding-teams, members\r\nof the branch Church, must be done by duly authorized and consecrated\r\nChristian Science functionaries. Her factory is the only one that makes\r\nand licenses them.\r\n\r\n[15. Nothing is said about christenings. It is inferable from this that\r\na Christian Science child is born a Christian Scientist and requires no\r\ntinkering.]\r\n\r\n[16. Nothing is said about funerals. It is inferable, then, that a\r\nbranch Church is privileged to do in that matter as it may choose.]\r\n\r\nTo sum up. Are any important Church-functions absent from the list? I\r\ncannot call any to mind. Are there any lacking ones whose exercise\r\ncould make the branch in any noticeable way independent of the Mother.\r\nChurch?--even in any trifling degree? I think of none. If the named\r\nfunctions were abolished would there still be a Church left? Would there\r\nbe even a shadow of a Church left? Would there be anything at all left?\r\neven the bare name?\r\n\r\nManifestly not. There isn't a single vital and essential Church-function\r\nof any kind, that is not named in the list. And over every one of them\r\nthe Mother-Church has permanent and unchallengeable control, upon\r\nevery one of them Mrs. Eddy has set her irremovable grip. She holds,\r\nin perpetuity, autocratic and indisputable sovereignty and control over\r\nevery branch Church in the earth; and yet says, in that sugary, naive,\r\nangel-beguiling way of hers, that the Mother-Church:\r\n\r\n\u201cshall assume no official control of other churches of this\r\ndenomination.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhereas in truth the unmeddled-with liberties of a branch Christian\r\nScience Church are but very, very few in number, and are these:\r\n\r\n1. It can appoint its own furnace-stoker, winters. 2. It can appoint\r\nits own fan-distributors, summers. 3. It can, in accordance with its own\r\nchoice in the matter, burn, bury, or preserve members who are pretending\r\nto be dead--whereas there is no such thing as death. 4. It can take up a\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nThe branch Churches have no important liberties, none that give them an\r\nimportant voice in their own affairs. Those are all locked up, and Mrs.\r\nEddy has the key. \u201cLocal Self-Government\u201d is a large name and sounds\r\nwell; but the branch Churches have no more of it than have the privates\r\nin the King of Dahomey's army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cMOTHER-CHURCH UNIQUE\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Eddy, with an envious and admiring eye upon the solitary and\r\nrivalless and world-shadowing majesty of St. Peter's, reveals in her\r\nBy-laws her purpose to set the Mother-Church apart by itself in a\r\nstately seclusion and make it duplicate that lone sublimity under the\r\nWestern sky. The By-law headed \u201cMother-Church Unique\u201d says--\r\n\r\n\u201cIn its relation to other Christian Science churches, the Mother-Church\r\nstands alone.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt occupies a position that no other Church can fill.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen for a branch Church to assume such position would be disastrous to\r\nChristian Science,\r\n\r\n\u201cTherefore--\u201d\r\n\r\nTherefore no branch Church is allowed to have branches. There shall\r\nbe no Christian Science St. Peter's in the earth but just one--the\r\nMother-Church in Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNO FIRST MEMBERS\u201d\r\n\r\nBut for the thoughtful By-law thus entitled, every Science branch in the\r\nearth would imitate the Mother-Church and set up an aristocracy. Every\r\nlittle group of ground-floor Smiths and Furgusons and Shadwells and\r\nSimpsons that organized a branch would assume that great title, of\r\n\u201cFirst Members,\u201d along with its vast privileges of \u201cdiscussing\u201d the\r\nweather and casting blank ballots, and soon there would be such a\r\nlocust-plague of them burdening the globe that the title would lose its\r\nvalue and have to be abolished.\r\n\r\nBut where business and glory are concerned, Mrs. Eddy thinks of\r\neverything, and so she did not fail to take care of her Aborigines,\r\nher stately and exclusive One Hundred, her college of functionless\r\ncardinals, her Sanhedrin of Privileged Talkers (Limited). After taking\r\naway all the liberties of the branch Churches, and in the same breath\r\ndisclaiming all official control over their affairs, she smites them on\r\nthe mouth with this--the very mouth that was watering for those nobby\r\nground-floor honors--\r\n\r\n\u201cNo First Members. Branch Churches shall not organize with First\r\nMembers, that special method of organization being adapted to the\r\nMother-Church alone.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd so, first members being prohibited, we pierce through the cloud\r\nof Mrs. Eddy's English and perceive that they must then necessarily\r\norganize with Subsequent Members. There is no other way. It will occur\r\nto them by-and-by to found an aristocracy of Early Subsequent Members.\r\nThere is no By-law against it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cTHE\u201d\r\n\r\nI uncover to that imperial word. And to the mind, too, that conceived\r\nthe idea of seizing and monopolizing it as a title. I believe it is Mrs.\r\nEddy's dazzlingest invention. For show, and style, and grandeur, and\r\nthunder and lightning and fireworks it outclasses all the previous\r\ninventions of man, and raises the limit on the Pope. He can never put\r\nhis avid hand on that word of words--it is pre-empted. And copyrighted,\r\nof course. It lifts the Mother-Church away up in the sky, and\r\nfellowships it with the rare and select and exclusive little company of\r\nthe THE's of deathless glory--persons and things whereof history and\r\nthe ages could furnish only single examples, not two: the Saviour, the\r\nVirgin, the Milky Way, the Bible, the Earth, the Equator, the Devil,\r\nthe Missing Link--and now The First Church, Scientist. And by clamor of\r\nedict and By-law Mrs. Eddy gives personal notice to all branch Scientist\r\nChurches on this planet to leave that THE alone.\r\n\r\nShe has demonstrated over it and made it sacred to the Mother-Church:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe article 'The' must not be used before the titles of branch\r\nChurches--\r\n\r\n\u201cNor written on applications for membership in naming such churches.\u201d\r\n\r\nThose are the terms. There can and will be a million First Churches\r\nof Christ, Scientist, scattered over the world, in a million towns and\r\nvillages and hamlets and cities, and each may call itself (suppressing\r\nthe article), \u201cFirst Church of Christ. Scientist\u201d--it is permissible,\r\nand no harm; but there is only one The Church of Christ, Scientist, and\r\nthere will never be another. And whether that great word fall in the\r\nmiddle of a sentence or at the beginning of it, it must always have its\r\ncapital T.\r\n\r\nI do not suppose that a juvenile passion for fussy little worldly shows\r\nand vanities can furnish a match to this, anywhere in the history of\r\nthe nursery. Mrs. Eddy does seem to be a shade fonder of little special\r\ndistinctions and pomps than is usual with human beings.\r\n\r\nShe instituted that immodest \u201cThe\u201d with her own hand; she did not wait\r\nfor somebody else to think of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LIFE-TERM MONOPOLY\r\n\r\nThere is but one human Pastor in the whole Christian Science world; she\r\nreserves that exalted place to herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PERPETUAL ONE\r\n\r\nThere is but one other object in the whole Christian Science world\r\nhonored with that title and holding that office: it is her book, the\r\nAnnex--permanent Pastor of The First Church, and of all branch Churches.\r\n\r\nWith her own hand she draughted the By-laws which make her the only\r\nreally absolute sovereign that lives to-day in Christendom.\r\n\r\nShe does not allow any objectionable pictures to be exhibited in the\r\nroom where her book is sold, nor any indulgence in idle gossip there;\r\nand from the general look of that By-law I judge that a lightsome and\r\nimproper person can be as uncomfortable in that place as he could be in\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SANCTUM SANCTORUM AND SACRED CHAIR\r\n\r\nIn a room in The First Church of Christ, Scientist, there is a museum\r\nof objects which have attained to holiness through contact with Mrs.\r\nEddy--among them an electrically lighted oil-picture of a chair which\r\nshe used to sit in--and disciples from all about the world go softly\r\nin there, in restricted groups, under proper guard, and reverently gaze\r\nupon those relics. It is worship. Mrs. Eddy could stop it if she was not\r\nfond of it, for her sovereignty over that temple is supreme.\r\n\r\nThe fitting-up of that place as a shrine is not an accident, nor a\r\ncasual, unweighed idea; it is imitated from age--old religious custom.\r\nIn Treves the pilgrim reverently gazes upon the Seamless Robe, and\r\nhumbly worships; and does the same in that other continental church\r\nwhere they keep a duplicate; and does likewise in the Church of the\r\nHoly Sepulchre, in Jerusalem, where memorials of the Crucifixion are\r\npreserved; and now, by good fortune we have our Holy Chair and things,\r\nand a market for our adorations nearer home.\r\n\r\nBut is there not a detail that is new, fresh, original? Yes, whatever\r\nold thing Mrs. Eddy touches gets something new by the contact--something\r\nnot thought of before by any one--something original, all her own, and\r\ncopyrightable. The new feature is self worship--exhibited in permitting\r\nthis shrine to be installed during her lifetime, and winking her sacred\r\neye at it.\r\n\r\nA prominent Christian Scientist has assured me that the Scientists do\r\nnot worship Mrs. Eddy, and I think it likely that there may be five or\r\nsix of the cult in the world who do not worship her, but she herself\r\nis certainly not of that company. Any healthy-minded person who will\r\nexamine Mrs. Eddy's little Autobiography and the Manual of By-laws\r\nwritten by her will be convinced that she worships herself; and that she\r\nbrings to this service a fervor of devotion surpassing even that which\r\nshe formerly laid at the feet of the Dollar, and equalling any which\r\nrises to the Throne of Grace from any quarter.\r\n\r\nI think this is as good a place as any to salve a hurt which I was the\r\nmeans of inflicting upon a Christian Scientist lately. The first third\r\nof this book was written in 1899 in Vienna. Until last summer I had\r\nsupposed that that third had been printed in a book which I published\r\nabout a year later--a hap which had not happened. I then sent the\r\nchapters composing it to the North American Review, but failed in one\r\ninstance, to date them. And so, in an undated chapter I said a lady told\r\nme \u201clast night\u201d so and so. There was nothing to indicate to the reader\r\nthat that \u201clast night\u201d was several years old, therefore the phrase\r\nseemed to refer to a night of very recent date. What the lady had told\r\nme was, that in a part of the Mother-Church in Boston she had seen\r\nScientists worshipping a portrait of Mrs. Eddy before which a light was\r\nkept constantly burning.\r\n\r\nA Scientist came to me and wished me to retract that \u201cuntruth.\u201d He said\r\nthere was no such portrait, and that if I wanted to be sure of it I\r\ncould go to Boston and see for myself. I explained that my \u201clast night\u201d\r\n meant a good while ago; that I did not doubt his assertion that there\r\nwas no such portrait there now, but that I should continue to believe it\r\nhad been there at the time of the lady's visit until she should retract\r\nher statement herself. I was at no time vouching for the truth of the\r\nremark, nevertheless I considered it worth par.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I am sorry the lady told me, since a wound which brings me no\r\nhappiness has resulted. I am most willing to apply such salve as I can.\r\nThe best way to set the matter right and make everything pleasant and\r\nagreeable all around will be to print in this place a description of the\r\nshrine as it appeared to a recent visitor, Mr. Frederick W. Peabody, of\r\nBoston. I will copy his newspaper account, and the reader will see that\r\nMrs. Eddy's portrait is not there now:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe lately stood on the threshold of the Holy of Holies of the\r\nMother-Church, and with a crowd of worshippers patiently waited for\r\nadmittance to the hallowed precincts of the 'Mother's Room.' Over the\r\ndoorway was a sign informing us that but four persons at a time would be\r\nadmitted; that they would be permitted to remain but five minutes only,\r\nand would please retire from the 'Mother's Room' at the ringing of the\r\nbell. Entering with three of the faithful, we looked with profane\r\neyes upon the consecrated furnishings. A show-woman in attendance\r\nmonotonously announced the character of the different appointments.\r\nSet in a recess of the wall and illumined with electric light was an\r\noil-painting the show-woman seriously declared to be a lifelike and\r\nrealistic picture of the Chair in which the Mother sat when she composed\r\nher 'inspired' work. It was a picture of an old-fashioned? country, hair\r\ncloth rocking-chair, and an exceedingly commonplace-looking table with a\r\npile of manuscript, an ink-bottle, and pen conspicuously upon it. On\r\nthe floor were sheets of manuscript. 'The mantel-piece is of pure onyx,'\r\ncontinued the show-woman, 'and the beehive upon the window-sill is made\r\nfrom one solid block of onyx; the rug is made of a hundred breasts of\r\neider-down ducks, and the toilet-room you see in the corner is of the\r\nlatest design, with gold-plated drain-pipes; the painted windows are\r\nfrom the Mother's poem, \u201cChrist and Christmas,\u201d and that case contains\r\ncomplete copies of all the Mother's books.' The chairs upon which the\r\nsacred person of the Mother had reposed were protected from sacrilegious\r\ntouch by a broad band of satin ribbon. My companions expressed their\r\nadmiration in subdued and reverent tones, and at the tinkling of the\r\nbell we reverently tiptoed out of the room to admit another delegation\r\nof the patient waiters at the door.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow, then, I hope the wound is healed. I am willing to relinquish the\r\nportrait, and compromise on the Chair. At the same time, if I were going\r\nto worship either, I should not choose the Chair.\r\n\r\nAs a picturesquely and persistently interesting personage, there is no\r\nmate to Mrs. Eddy, the accepted Equal of the Saviour. But some of her\r\ntastes are so different from His! I find it quite impossible to imagine\r\nHim, in life, standing sponsor for that museum there, and taking\r\npleasure in its sumptuous shows. I believe He would put that Chair in\r\nthe fire, and the bell along with it; and I think He would make the\r\nshow-woman go away. I think He would break those electric bulbs, and the\r\n\u201cmantel-piece of pure onyx,\u201d and say reproachful things about the golden\r\ndrain-pipes of the lavatory, and give the costly rug of duck-breasts to\r\nthe poor, and sever the satin ribbon and invite the weary to rest and\r\nease their aches in the consecrated chairs. What He would do with the\r\npainted windows we can better conjecture when we come presently to\r\nexamine their peculiarities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE PASTOR-UNIVERSAL\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Eddy turned the pastors out of all the Christian Science\r\nchurches and abolished the office for all time as far as human occupancy\r\nis concerned--she appointed the Holy Ghost to fill their place. If this\r\nlanguage be blasphemous, I did not invent the blasphemy, I am merely\r\nstating a fact. I will quote from page 227 of Science and Health\r\n(edition 1899), as a first step towards an explanation of this startling\r\nmatter--a passage which sets forth and classifies the Christian Science\r\nTrinity:\r\n\r\n\u201cLife, Truth, and Love constitute the triune God, or triply divine\r\nPrinciple. They represent a trinity in unity, three in one--the same in\r\nessence, though multiform in office: God the Father; Christ the type of\r\nSonship; Divine Science, or the Holy Comforter....\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Holy Ghost, or Spirit, reveals this triune Principle, and (the Holy\r\nGhost) is expressed in Divine Science, which is the Comforter,\r\nleading into all Truth, and revealing the divine Principle of the\r\nuniverse--universal and perpetual harmony.\u201d\r\n\r\nI will cite another passage. Speaking of Jesus--\r\n\r\n\u201cHis students then received the Holy Ghost. By this is meant, that by\r\nall they had witnessed and suffered they were roused to an enlarged\r\nunderstanding of Divine Science, even to the spiritual interpretation..\r\n... of His teachings,\u201d etc.\r\n\r\nAlso, page 579, in the chapter called the Glossary:\r\n\r\n\u201cHOLY GHOST. Divine Science; the developments of Life, Truth, and Love.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Holy Ghost reveals the massed spirit of the fused trinity; this\r\nmassed spirit is expressed in Divine Science, and is the Comforter;\r\nDivine Science conveys to men the \u201cspiritual interpretation\u201d of\r\nthe Saviour's teachings. That seems to be the meaning of the quoted\r\npassages.\r\n\r\nDivine Science is Christian Science; the book \u201cScience and Health\u201d is a\r\n\u201crevelation\u201d of the whole spirit of the Trinity, and is therefore \u201cThe\r\nHoly Ghost\u201d; it conveys to men the \u201cspiritual interpretation\u201d of the\r\nBible's teachings and therefore is \u201cthe Comforter.\u201d\r\n\r\nI do not find this analyzing work easy, I would rather saw wood; and a\r\nperson can never tell whether he has added up a Science and Health sum\r\nright or not, anyway, after all his trouble. Neither can he easily find\r\nout whether the texts are still on the market or have been discarded\r\nfrom the Book; for two hundred and fifty-eight editions of it have been\r\nissued, and no two editions seem to be alike. The annual changes--in\r\ntechnical terminology; in matter and wording; in transpositions of\r\nchapters and verses; in leaving out old chapters and verses and putting\r\nin new ones--seem to be next to innumerable, and as there is no index,\r\nthere is no way to find a thing one wants without reading the book\r\nthrough. If ever I inspire a Bible-Annex I will not rush at it in a\r\nhalf-digested, helter-skelter way and have to put in thirty-eight years\r\ntrying to get some of it the way I want it, I will sit down and think it\r\nout and know what it is I want to say before I begin. An inspirer cannot\r\ninspire for Mrs. Eddy and keep his reputation. I have never seen such\r\nslipshod work, bar the ten that interpreted for the home market the\r\n\u201csell all thou hast.\u201d I have quoted one \u201cspiritual\u201d rendering of the\r\nLord's Prayer, I have seen one other one, and am told there are\r\nfive more. Yet the inspirer of Mrs. Eddy the new Infallible casts a\r\ncomplacent critical stone at the other Infallible for being unable to\r\nmake up its mind about such things. Science and Health, edition 1899,\r\npage 33:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe decisions, by vote of Church Councils, as to what should and\r\nshould not be considered Holy Writ, the manifest mistakes in the ancient\r\nversions: the thirty thousand different readings in the Old Testament\r\nand the three hundred thousand in the New--these facts show how a mortal\r\nand material sense stole into the divine record, darkening, to some\r\nextent, the inspired pages with its own hue.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo some extent, yes--speaking cautiously. But it is nothing, really\r\nnothing; Mrs. Eddy is only a little way behind, and if her inspirer\r\nlives to get her Annex to suit him that Catholic record will have to \u201cgo\r\n'way back and set down,\u201d as the ballad says. Listen to the boastful song\r\nof Mrs. Eddy's organ, the Christian Science Journal for March, 1902,\r\nabout that year's revamping and half-soling of Science and Health,\r\nwhose official name is the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, and who is now\r\nthe Official Pastor and Infallible and Unerring Guide of every Christian\r\nScience church in the two hemispheres, hear Simple Simon that met the\r\npieman brag of the Infallible's fallibility:\r\n\r\n\u201cThroughout the entire book the verbal changes are so numerous as to\r\nindicate the vast amount of time and labor Mrs. Eddy has devoted to this\r\nrevision. The time and labor thus bestowed is relatively as great as\r\nthat of--the committee who revised the Bible.... Thus we have additional\r\nevidence of the herculean efforts our beloved Leader has made and is\r\nconstantly making for the promulgation of Truth and the furtherance of\r\nher divinely bestowed mission,\u201d etc.\r\n\r\nIt is a steady job. I could help inspire if desired; I am not doing\r\nmuch now, and would work for half-price, and should not object to the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRICE OF THE PASTOR-UNIVERSAL\r\n\r\nThe price of the Pastor-Universal, Science and Health, called in Science\r\nliterature the Comforter--and by that other sacred Name--is three\r\ndollars in cloth, as heretofore, six when it is finely bound, and shaped\r\nto imitate the Testament, and is broken into verses. Margin of profit\r\nabove cost of manufacture, from five hundred to seven hundred per\r\ncent., as already noted In the profane subscription-trade, it costs\r\nthe publisher heavily to canvass a three-dollar book; he must pay the\r\ngeneral agent sixty per cent. commission--that is to say, one dollar and\r\neighty-cents. Mrs. Eddy escapes this blistering tax, because she owns\r\nthe Christian Science canvasser, and can compel him to work for nothing.\r\nRead the following command--not request--fulminated by Mrs. Eddy, over\r\nher signature, in the Christian Science Journal for March, 1897, and\r\nquoted by Mr. Peabody in his book. The book referred to is Science and\r\nHealth:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt shall be the duty of all Christian Scientists to circulate and to\r\nsell as many of these books as they can.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat is flung at all the elect, everywhere that the sun shines, but no\r\npenalty is shaken over their heads to scare them. The same command was\r\nissued to the members (numbering to-day twenty-five thousand) of The\r\nMother-Church, also, but with it went a threat, of the infliction, in\r\ncase of disobedience, of the most dreaded punishment that has a place\r\nin the Church's list of penalties for transgressions of Mrs. Eddy's\r\nedicts--excommunication:\r\n\r\n\u201cIf a member of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, shall fail to\r\nobey this injunction, it will render him liable to lose his membership\r\nin this Church. MARY BAKER EDDY.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt is the spirit of the Spanish Inquisition.\r\n\r\nNone but accepted and well established gods can venture an affront like\r\nthat and do it with confidence. But the human race will take anything\r\nfrom that class. Mrs. Eddy knows the human race; knows it better than\r\nany mere human being has known it in a thousand centuries. My confidence\r\nin her human-beingship is getting shaken, my confidence in her godship\r\nis stiffening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVEN HUNDRED PER CENT.\r\n\r\nA Scientist out West has visited a bookseller--with intent to find fault\r\nwith me--and has brought away the information that the price at which\r\nMrs. Eddy sells Science and Health is not an unusually high one for the\r\nsize and make of the book. That is true. But in the book-trade--that\r\nprofit-devourer unknown to Mrs. Eddy's book--a three-dollar book that\r\nis made for thirty-five or forty cents in large editions is put at\r\nthree dollars because the publisher has to pay author, middleman, and\r\nadvertising, and if the price were much below three the profit accruing\r\nwould not pay him fairly for his time and labor. At the same time, if\r\nhe could get ten dollars for the book he would take it, and his morals\r\nwould not fall under criticism.\r\n\r\nBut if he were an inspired person commissioned by the Deity to receive\r\nand print and spread broadcast among sorrowing and suffering and poor\r\nmen a precious message of healing and cheer and salvation, he would have\r\nto do as Bible Societies do--sell the book at a pinched margin above\r\ncost to such as could pay, and give it free to all that couldn't; and\r\nhis name would be praised. But if he sold it at seven hundred per cent.\r\nprofit and put the money in his pocket, his name would be mocked and\r\nderided. Just as Mrs. Eddy's is. And most justifiably, as it seems to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThe complete Bible contains one million words. The New Testament by\r\nitself contains two hundred and forty thousand words.\r\n\r\nMy '84 edition of Science and Health contains one hundred and twenty\r\nthousand words--just half as many as the New Testament.\r\n\r\nScience and Health has since been so inflated by later inspirations that\r\nthe 1902 edition contains one hundred and eighty thousand words--not\r\ncounting the thirty thousand at the back, devoted by Mrs. Eddy to\r\nadvertising the book's healing abilities--and the inspiring continues\r\nright along.\r\n\r\nIf you have a book whose market is so sure and so great that you\r\ncan give a printer an everlasting order for thirty or forty or fifty\r\nthousand copies a year he will furnish them at a cheap rate, because\r\nwhenever there is a slack time in his press-room and bindery he can\r\nfill the idle intervals on your book and be making something instead\r\nof losing. That is the kind of contract that can be let on Science and\r\nHealth every year. I am obliged to doubt that the three-dollar Science\r\nand Health costs Mrs. Eddy above fifteen cents, or that the six dollar\r\ncopy costs her above eighty cents. I feel quite sure that the average\r\nprofit to her on these books, above cost of manufacture, is all of seven\r\nhundred per cent.\r\n\r\nEvery proper Christian Scientist has to buy and own (and canvass for)\r\nScience and Health (one hundred and eighty thousand words), and he must\r\nalso own a Bible (one million words). He can buy the one for from three\r\nto six dollars, and the other for fifteen cents. Or, if three dollars is\r\nall the money he has, he can get his Bible for nothing. When the Supreme\r\nBeing disseminates a saving Message through uninspired agents--the New\r\nTestament, for instance--it can be done for five cents a copy, but when\r\nHe sends one containing only two-thirds as many words through the shop\r\nof a Divine Personage, it costs sixty times as much. I think that\r\nin matters of such importance it is bad economy to employ a wild-cat\r\nagency.\r\n\r\nHere are some figures which are perfectly authentic, and which seem to\r\njustify my opinion.\r\n\r\n\u201cThese [Bible] societies, inspired only by a sense of religious duty,\r\nare issuing the Bible at a price so small that they have made it the\r\ncheapest book printed. For example, the American Bible Society offers an\r\nedition of the whole Bible as low as fifteen cents and the New Testament\r\nat five cents, and the British Society at sixpence and one penny,\r\nrespectively. These low prices, made possible by their policy of selling\r\nthe books at cost or below cost,\u201d etc.--New York Sun, February 25, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nWe may now make a final footing-up of Mrs. Eddy, and see what she is, in\r\nthe fulness of her powers. She is:\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Metaphysical College Pastor Emeritus; President; Board\r\nof Directors; Board of Education; Board of Lectureships; Future Board of\r\nTrustees, Proprietor of the Publishing-House and Periodicals; Treasurer;\r\nClerk; Proprietor of the Teachers; Proprietor of the Lecturers;\r\nProprietor of the Missionaries; Proprietor of the Readers; Dictator of\r\nthe Services; sole Voice of the Pulpit; Proprietor of the Sanhedrin;\r\nSole Proprietor of the Creed. (Copyrighted.); Indisputable Autocrat\r\nof the Branch Churches, with their life and death in her hands; Sole\r\nThinker for The First Church (and the others); Sole and Infallible\r\nExpounder of Doctrine, in life and in death; Sole permissible\r\nDiscoverer, Denouncer, Judge, and Executioner of Ostensible Hypnotists;\r\nFifty-handed God of Excommunication--with a thunderbolt in every hand;\r\nAppointer and Installer of the Pastor of all the Churches--the Perpetual\r\nPastor-Universal, Science and Health, \u201cthe Comforter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nThere she stands-painted by herself. No witness but herself has been\r\nallowed to testify. She stands there painted by her acts, and decorated\r\nby her words. When she talks, she has only a decorative value as\r\na witness, either for or against herself, for she deals mainly in\r\nunsupported assertion; and in the rare cases where she puts forward a\r\nverifiable fact she gets out of it a meaning which it refuses to furnish\r\nto anybody else. Also, when she talks, she is unstable, she wanders,\r\nshe is incurably inconsistent; what she says to-day she contradicts\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\nBut her acts are consistent. They are always faithful to her, they never\r\nmisinterpret her, they are a mirror which always reflects her exactly,\r\nprecisely, minutely, unerringly, and always the same, to date, with only\r\nthose progressive little natural changes in stature, dress, complexion,\r\nmood, and carriage that mark--exteriorly--the march of the years and\r\nrecord the accumulations of experience, while--interiorly--through all\r\nthis steady drift of evolution the one essential detail, the commanding\r\ndetail, the master detail of the make-up remains as it was in the\r\nbeginning, suffers no change and can suffer none; the basis of the\r\ncharacter; the temperament, the disposition, that indestructible iron\r\nframework upon which the character is built, and whose shape it must\r\ntake, and keep, throughout life. We call it a person's nature.\r\n\r\nThe man who is born stingy can be taught to give liberally--with his\r\nhands; but not with his heart. The man born kind and compassionate\r\ncan have that disposition crushed down out of sight by embittering\r\nexperience; but if it were an organ the post-mortem would find it still\r\nin his corpse. The man born ambitious of power and glory may live long\r\nwithout finding it out, but when the opportunity comes he will know,\r\nwill strike for the largest thing within the limit of his chances at the\r\ntime-constable, perhaps--and will be glad and proud when he gets it,\r\nand will write home about it. But he will not stop with that start; his\r\nappetite will come again; and by-and-by again, and yet again; and when\r\nhe has climbed to police commissioner it will at last begin to dawn upon\r\nhim that what his Napoleon soul wants and was born for is something away\r\nhigher up--he does not quite know what, but Circumstance and Opportunity\r\nwill indicate the direction and he will cut a road through and find out.\r\n\r\nI think Mrs. Eddy was born with a far-seeing business-eye, but did not\r\nknow it; and with a great organizing and executive talent, and did not\r\nknow it; and with a large appetite for power and distinction, and did\r\nnot know it. I think the reason that her make did not show up until\r\nmiddle life was that she had General Grant's luck--Circumstance and\r\nOpportunity did not come her way when she was younger. The qualities\r\nthat were born in her had to wait for circumstance and opportunity--but\r\nthey were there: they were there to stay, whether they ever got a chance\r\nto fructify or not. If they had come early, they would have found her\r\nready and competent. And they--not she--would have determined what they\r\nwould set her at and what they would make of her. If they had elected to\r\ncommission her as second-assistant cook in a bankrupt boarding-house,\r\nI know the rest of it--I know what would have happened. She would have\r\nowned the boarding-house within six months; she would have had the late\r\nproprietor on salary and humping himself, as the worldly say; she would\r\nhave had that boarding-house spewing money like a mint; she would have\r\nworked the servants and the late landlord up to the limit; she would\r\nhave squeezed the boarders till they wailed, and by some mysterious\r\nquality born in her she would have kept the affections of certain of the\r\nlot whose love and esteem she valued, and flung the others down the back\r\narea; in two years she would own all the boarding-houses in the town, in\r\nfive all the boarding-houses in the State, in twenty all the hotels in\r\nAmerica, in forty all the hotels on the planet, and would sit at home\r\nwith her finger on a button and govern the whole combination as easily\r\nas a bench-manager governs a dog-show.\r\n\r\nIt would be a grand thing to see, and I feel a kind of\r\ndisappointment--but never mind, a religion is better and larger; and\r\nthere is more to it. And I have not been steeping myself in Christian\r\nScience all these weeks without finding out that the one sensible thing\r\nto do with a disappointment is to put it out of your mind and think of\r\nsomething cheerfuler.\r\n\r\nWe outsiders cannot conceive of Mrs. Eddy's Christian Science Religion\r\nas being a sudden and miraculous birth, but only as a growth from a seed\r\nplanted by circumstances, and developed stage by stage by command and\r\ncompulsion of the same force. What the stages were we cannot know, but\r\nare privileged to guess. She may have gotten the mental-healing idea\r\nfrom Quimby--it had been experimented with for ages, and was no one's\r\nspecial property. [For the present, for convenience' sake, let us\r\nproceed upon the hypothesis that that was all she got of him, and that\r\nshe put up the rest of the assets herself. This will strain us, but\r\nlet us try it.] In each and all its forms and under all its many names,\r\nmental healing had had limits, always, and they were rather narrow\r\nones--Mrs. Eddy, let us imagine, removed the fence, abolished the\r\nfrontiers. Not by expanding mental-healing, but by absorbing its small\r\nbulk into the vaster bulk of Christian Science--Divine Science, The Holy\r\nGhost, the Comforter--which was a quite different and sublimer force,\r\nand one which had long lain dormant and unemployed.\r\n\r\nThe Christian Scientist believes that the Spirit of God (life and love)\r\npervades the universe like an atmosphere; that whoso will study Science\r\nand Health can get from it the secret of how to inhale that transforming\r\nair; that to breathe it is to be made new; that from the new man all\r\nsorrow, all care, all miseries of the mind vanish away, for that only\r\npeace, contentment and measureless joy can live in that divine fluid;\r\nthat it purifies the body from disease, which is a vicious creation of\r\nthe gross human mind, and cannot continue to exist in the presence of\r\nthe Immortal Mind, the renewing Spirit of God.\r\n\r\nThe Scientist finds this reasonable, natural, and not harder to believe\r\nthan that the disease germ, a creature of darkness, perishes when\r\nexposed to the light of the great sun--a new revelation of profane\r\nscience which no one doubts. He reminds us that the actinic ray, shining\r\nupon lupus, cures it--a horrible disease which was incurable fifteen\r\nyears ago, and had been incurable for ten million years before; that\r\nthis wonder, unbelievable by the physicians at first, is believed by\r\nthem now; and so he is tranquilly confident that the time is coming when\r\nthe world will be educated up to a point where it will comprehend and\r\ngrant that the light of the Spirit of God, shining unobstructed upon the\r\nsoul, is an actinic ray which can purge both mind and body from disease\r\nand set them free and make them whole.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent, then, that in Christian Science it is not one man's mind\r\nacting upon another man's mind that heals; that it is solely the Spirit\r\nof God that heals; that the healer's mind performs no office but to\r\nconvey that force to the patient; that it is merely the wire which\r\ncarries the electric fluid, so to speak, and delivers the message.\r\nTherefore, if these things be true, mental-healing and Science-healing\r\nare separate and distinct processes, and no kinship exists between them.\r\n\r\nTo heal the body of its ills and pains is a mighty benefaction, but in\r\nour day our physicians and surgeons work a thousand miracles--prodigies\r\nwhich would have ranked as miracles fifty years ago--and they have so\r\ngreatly extended their domination over disease that we feel so well\r\nprotected that we are able to look with a good deal of composure and\r\nabsence of hysterics upon the claims of new competitors in that field.\r\n\r\nBut there is a mightier benefaction than the healing of the body, and\r\nthat is the healing of the spirit--which is Christian Science's other\r\nclaim. So far as I know, so far as I can find out, it makes it good.\r\nPersonally I have not known a Scientist who did not seem serene,\r\ncontented, unharassed. I have not found an outsider whose observation\r\nof Scientists furnished him a view that differed from my own. Buoyant\r\nspirits, comfort of mind, freedom from care these happinesses we all\r\nhave, at intervals; but in the spaces between, dear me, the black hours!\r\nThey have put a curse upon the life of every human being I have ever\r\nknown, young or old. I concede not a single exception. Unless it might\r\nbe those Scientists just referred to. They may have been playing a part\r\nwith me; I hope they were not, and I believe they were not.\r\n\r\nTime will test the Science's claim. If time shall make it good; if time\r\nshall prove that the Science can heal the persecuted spirit of man and\r\nbanish its troubles and keep it serene and sunny and content--why, then\r\nMrs. Eddy will have a monument that will reach above the clouds. For if\r\nshe did not hit upon that imperial idea and evolve it and deliver it,\r\nits discoverer can never be identified with certainty, now, I think.\r\nIt is the giant feature, it is the sun that rides in the zenith of\r\nChristian Science, the auxiliary features are of minor consequence [Let\r\nus still leave the large \u201cif\u201d aside, for the present, and proceed as if\r\nit had no existence.]\r\n\r\nIt is not supposable that Mrs. Eddy realized, at first, the size of her\r\nplunder. (No, find--that is the word; she did not realize the size of\r\nher find, at first.) It had to grow upon her, by degrees, in accordance\r\nwith the inalterable custom of Circumstance, which works by stages, and\r\nby stages only, and never furnishes any mind with all the materials for\r\na large idea at one time.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, Mrs. Eddy was probably interested merely in the\r\nmental-healing detail, and perhaps mainly interested in it pecuniary,\r\nfor she was poor.\r\n\r\nShe would succeed in anything she undertook. She would attract pupils,\r\nand her commerce would grow. She would inspire in patient and pupil\r\nconfidence in her earnestness, her history is evidence that she would\r\nnot fail of that.\r\n\r\nThere probably came a time, in due course, when her students began to\r\nthink there was something deeper in her teachings than they had\r\nbeen suspecting--a mystery beyond mental-healing, and higher. It is\r\nconceivable that by consequence their manner towards her changed little\r\nby little, and from respectful became reverent. It is conceivable that\r\nthis would have an influence upon her; that it would incline her to\r\nwonder if their secret thought--that she was inspired--might not be a\r\nwell-grounded guess. It is conceivable that as time went on the\r\nthought in their minds and its reflection in hers might solidify into\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nShe would remember, then, that as a child she had been called, more\r\nthan once, by a mysterious voice--just as had happened to little Samuel.\r\n(Mentioned in her Autobiography.) She would be impressed by that ancient\r\nreminiscence, now, and it could have a prophetic meaning for her.\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that the persuasive influences around her and within\r\nher would give a new and powerful impulse to her philosophizings, and\r\nthat from this, in time, would result that great birth, the healing of\r\nbody and mind by the inpouring of the Spirit of God--the central and\r\ndominant idea of Christian Science--and that when this idea came she\r\nwould not doubt that it was an inspiration direct from Heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n[I must rest a little, now. To sit here and painstakingly spin out a\r\nscheme which imagines Mrs. Eddy, of all people, working her mind on\r\na plane above commercialism; imagines her thinking, philosophizing,\r\ndiscovering majestic things; and even imagines her dealing in\r\nsincerities--to be frank, I find it a large contract But I have begun\r\nit, and I will go through with it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nIt is evident that she made disciples fast, and that their belief in her\r\nand in the authenticity of her heavenly ambassadorship was not of the\r\nlukewarm and half-way sort, but was profoundly earnest and sincere.\r\nHer book was issued from the press in 1875, it began its work of\r\nconvert-making, and within six years she had successfully launched a new\r\nReligion and a new system of healing, and was teaching them to crowds of\r\neager students in a College of her own, at prices so extraordinary\r\nthat we are almost compelled to accept her statement (no, her guarded\r\nintimation) that the rates were arranged on high, since a mere human\r\nbeing unacquainted with commerce and accustomed to think in pennies\r\ncould hardly put up such a hand as that without supernatural help.\r\n\r\nFrom this stage onward--Mrs. Eddy being what she was--the rest of the\r\ndevelopment--stages would follow naturally and inevitably.\r\n\r\nBut if she had been anybody else, there would have been a different\r\narrangement of them, with different results. Being the extraordinary\r\nperson she was, she realized her position and its possibilities;\r\nrealized the possibilities, and had the daring to use them for all they\r\nwere worth.\r\n\r\nWe have seen what her methods were after she passed the stage where her\r\ndivine ambassadorship was granted its executer in the hearts and minds\r\nof her followers; we have seen how steady and fearless and calculated\r\nand orderly was her march thenceforth from conquest to conquest; we have\r\nseen her strike dead, without hesitancy, any hostile or questionable\r\nforce that rose in her path: first, the horde of pretenders that sprang\r\nup and tried to take her Science and its market away from her--she\r\ncrushed them, she obliterated them; when her own National Christian\r\nScience Association became great in numbers and influence, and loosely\r\nand dangerously garrulous, and began to expound the doctrines according\r\nto its own uninspired notions, she took up her sponge without a tremor\r\nof fear and wiped that Association out; when she perceived that\r\nthe preachers in her pulpits were becoming afflicted with\r\ndoctrine-tinkering, she recognized the danger of it, and did not\r\nhesitate nor temporize, but promptly dismissed the whole of them in a\r\nday, and abolished their office permanently; we have seen that, as fast\r\nas her power grew, she was competent to take the measure of it, and that\r\nas fast as its expansion suggested to her gradually awakening native\r\nambition a higher step she took it; and so, by this evolutionary\r\nprocess, we have seen the gross money-lust relegated to second place,\r\nand the lust of empire and glory rise above it. A splendid dream; and by\r\nforce of the qualities born in her she is making it come true.\r\n\r\nThese qualities--and the capacities growing out of them by the nurturing\r\ninfluences of training, observation, and experience seem to be clearly\r\nindicated by the character of her career and its achievements. They seem\r\nto be:\r\n\r\nA clear head for business, and a phenomenally long one; Clear\r\nunderstanding of business situations; Accuracy in estimating the\r\nopportunities they offer; Intelligence in planning a business move;\r\nFirmness in sticking to it after it has been decided upon; Extraordinary\r\ndaring; Indestructible persistency; Devouring ambition; Limitless\r\nselfishness; A knowledge of the weaknesses and poverties and docilities\r\nof human nature and how to turn them to account which has never been\r\nsurpassed, if ever equalled.\r\n\r\nAnd--necessarily--the foundation-stone of Mrs. Eddy's character is a\r\nnever-wavering confidence in herself.\r\n\r\nIt is a granite character. And--quite naturally--a measure of the talc\r\nof smallnesses common to human nature is mixed up in it and distributed\r\nthrough it. When Mrs. Eddy is not dictating servilities from her throne\r\nin the clouds to her official domestics in Boston or to her far-spread\r\nsubjects round about the planet, but is down on the ground, she is kin\r\nto us and one of us: sentimental as a girl, garrulous, ungrammatical,\r\nincomprehensible, affected, vain of her little human ancestry, unstable,\r\ninconsistent, unreliable in statement, and naively and everlastingly\r\nself-contradictory-oh, trivial and common and commonplace as the\r\ncommonest of us! just a Napoleon as Madame de Remusat saw him, a brass\r\ngod with clay legs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nIn drawing Mrs. Eddy's portrait it has been my purpose to restrict\r\nmyself to materials furnished by herself, and I believe I have done\r\nthat. If I have misinterpreted any of her acts, it was not done\r\nintentionally.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that in skeletonizing a list of the qualities which\r\nhave carried her to the dizzy summit which she occupies, I have not\r\nmentioned the power which was the commanding force employed in achieving\r\nthat lofty flight. It did not belong in that list; it was a force that\r\nwas not a detail of her character, but was an outside one. It was\r\nthe power which proceeded from her people's recognition of her as\r\na supernatural personage, conveyer of the Latest Word, and divinely\r\ncommissioned to deliver it to the world. The form which such a\r\nrecognition takes, consciously or unconsciously, is worship; and worship\r\ndoes not question nor criticize, it obeys. The object of it does not\r\nneed to coddle it, bribe it, beguile it, reason with it, convince\r\nit--it commands it; that is sufficient; the obedience rendered is not\r\nreluctant, but prompt and whole-hearted. Admiration for a Napoleon,\r\nconfidence in him, pride in him, affection for him, can lift him high\r\nand carry him far; and these are forms of worship, and are strong\r\nforces, but they are worship of a mere human being, after all, and are\r\ninfinitely feeble, as compared with those that are generated by that\r\nother worship, the worship of a divine personage. Mrs. Eddy has this\r\nefficient worship, this massed and centralized force, this force which\r\nis indifferent to opposition, untroubled by fear, and goes to battle\r\nsinging, like Cromwell's soldiers; and while she has it she can command\r\nand it will obey, and maintain her on her throne, and extend her empire.\r\n\r\nShe will have it until she dies; and then we shall see a curious and\r\ninteresting further development of her revolutionary work begin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nThe President and Board of Directors will succeed her, and the\r\ngovernment will go on without a hitch. The By-laws will bear that\r\ninterpretation. All the Mother-Church's vast powers are concentrated in\r\nthat Board. Mrs. Eddy's unlimited personal reservations make the Board's\r\nostensible supremacy, during her life, a sham, and the Board itself a\r\nshadow. But Mrs. Eddy has not made those reservations for any one but\r\nherself--they are distinctly personal, they bear her name, they are not\r\nusable by another individual. When she dies her reservations die, and\r\nthe Board's shadow-powers become real powers, without the change of\r\nany important By-law, and the Board sits in her place as absolute and\r\nirresponsible a sovereign as she was.\r\n\r\nIt consists of but five persons, a much more manageable Cardinalate than\r\nthe Roman Pope's. I think it will elect its Pope from its own body, and\r\nthat it will fill its own vacancies. An elective Papacy is a safe and\r\nwise system, and a long-liver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nWe may take that up now.\r\n\r\nIt is not a single if, but a several-jointed one; not an oyster, but a\r\nvertebrate.\r\n\r\n1. Did Mrs. Eddy borrow from Quimby the Great Idea, or only the little\r\none, the old-timer, the ordinary mental-healing-healing by \u201cmortal\u201d\r\n mind?\r\n\r\n2. If she borrowed the Great Idea, did she carry it away in her head, or\r\nin manuscript?\r\n\r\n3. Did she hit upon the Great Idea herself? By the Great Idea I mean, of\r\ncourse, the conviction that the Force involved was still existent, and\r\ncould be applied now just as it was applied by Christ's Disciples and\r\ntheir converts, and as successfully.\r\n\r\n4. Did she philosophize it, systematize it, and write it down in a book?\r\n\r\n5. Was it she, and not another, that built a new Religion upon the book\r\nand organized it?\r\n\r\nI think No. 5 can be answered with a Yes, and dismissed from the\r\ncontroversy. And I think that the Great Idea, great as it was, would\r\nhave enjoyed but a brief activity, and would then have gone to sleep\r\nagain for some more centuries, but for the perpetuating impulse it got\r\nfrom that organized and tremendous force.\r\n\r\nAs for Nos. 1, 2, and 4, the hostiles contend that Mrs. Eddy got the\r\nGreat Idea from Quimby and carried it off in manuscript. But their\r\ntestimony, while of consequence, lacks the most important detail; so far\r\nas my information goes, the Quimby manuscript has not been produced. I\r\nthink we cannot discuss No. 1 and No. 2 profitably. Let them go.\r\n\r\nFor me, No. 3 has a mild interest, and No. 4 a violent one.\r\n\r\nAs regards No. 3, Mrs. Eddy was brought up, from the cradle, an\r\nold-time, boiler-iron, Westminster-Catechism Christian, and knew\r\nher Bible as well as Captain Kydd knew his, \u201cwhen he sailed, when he\r\nsailed,\u201d and perhaps as sympathetically. The Great Idea had struck a\r\nmillion Bible-readers before her as being possible of resurrection and\r\napplication--it must have struck as many as that, and been cogitated,\r\nindolently, doubtingly, then dropped and forgotten--and it could have\r\nstruck her, in due course. But how it could interest her, how it\r\ncould appeal to her--with her make this a thing that is difficult to\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nFor the thing back of it is wholly gracious and beautiful: the power,\r\nthrough loving mercifulness and compassion, to heal fleshly ills and\r\npains and grief--all--with a word, with a touch of the hand! This power\r\nwas given by the Saviour to the Disciples, and to all the converted.\r\nAll--every one. It was exercised for generations afterwards.\r\nAny Christian who was in earnest and not a make-believe, not a\r\npolicy--Christian, not a Christian for revenue only, had that healing\r\npower, and could cure with it any disease or any hurt or damage possible\r\nto human flesh and bone. These things are true, or they are not. If they\r\nwere true seventeen and eighteen and nineteen centuries ago it would be\r\ndifficult to satisfactorily explain why or how or by what argument that\r\npower should be nonexistent in Christians now.\r\n\r\nTo wish to exercise it could occur to Mrs. Eddy--but would it?\r\n\r\nGrasping, sordid, penurious, famishing for everything she sees--money,\r\npower, glory--vain, untruthful, jealous, despotic, arrogant, insolent,\r\npitiless where thinkers and hypnotists are concerned, illiterate,\r\nshallow, incapable of reasoning outside of commercial lines,\r\nimmeasurably selfish--\r\n\r\nOf course the Great Idea could strike her, we have to grant that, but\r\nwhy it should interest her is a question which can easily overstrain the\r\nimagination and bring on nervous prostration, or something like that,\r\nand is better left alone by the judicious, it seems to me--\r\n\r\nUnless we call to our help the alleged other side of Mrs. Eddy's\r\nmake and character the side which her multitude of followers see, and\r\nsincerely believe in. Fairness requires that their view be stated\r\nhere. It is the opposite of the one which I have drawn from Mrs. Eddy's\r\nhistory and from her By-laws. To her followers she is this:\r\n\r\nPatient, gentle, loving, compassionate, noble hearted, unselfish,\r\nsinless, widely cultured, splendidly equipped mentally, a profound\r\nthinker, an able writer, a divine personage, an inspired messenger whose\r\nacts are dictated from the Throne, and whose every utterance is the\r\nVoice of God.\r\n\r\nShe has delivered to them a religion which has revolutionized their\r\nlives, banished the glooms that shadowed them, and filled them and\r\nflooded them with sunshine and gladness and peace; a religion which has\r\nno hell; a religion whose heaven is not put off to another time, with\r\na break and a gulf between, but begins here and now, and melts into\r\neternity as fancies of the waking day melt into the dreams of sleep.\r\n\r\nThey believe it is a Christianity that is in the New Testament; that\r\nit has always been there, that in the drift of ages it was lost through\r\ndisuse and neglect, and that this benefactor has found it and given it\r\nback to men, turning the night of life into day, its terrors into myths,\r\nits lamentations into songs of emancipation and rejoicing.\r\n\r\nThere we have Mrs. Eddy as her followers see her. She has lifted\r\nthem out of grief and care and doubt and fear, and made their lives\r\nbeautiful; she found them wandering forlorn in a wintry wilderness, and\r\nhas led them to a tropic paradise like that of which the poet sings:\r\n\r\n     \u201cO, islands there are on the face of the deep\r\n     Where the leaves never fade and the skies never weep.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo ask them to examine with a microscope the character of such a\r\nbenefactor; to ask them to examine it at all; to ask them to look at a\r\nblemish which another person believes he has found in it--well, in their\r\nplace could you do it? Would you do it? Wouldn't you be ashamed to do\r\nit? If a tramp had rescued your child from fire and death, and saved its\r\nmother's heart from breaking, could you see his rags? Could you smell\r\nhis breath? Mrs. Eddy has done more than that for these people.\r\n\r\nThey are prejudiced witnesses. To the credit of human nature it is not\r\npossible that they should be otherwise. They sincerely believe that\r\nMrs. Eddy's character is pure and perfect and beautiful, and her history\r\nwithout stain or blot or blemish. But that does not settle it. They\r\nsincerely believe she did not borrow the Great Idea from Quimby, but hit\r\nupon it herself. It may be so, and it could be so. Let it go--there\r\nis no way to settle it. They believe she carried away no Quimby\r\nmanuscripts. Let that go, too--there is no way to settle it. They\r\nbelieve that she, and not another, built the Religion upon the book, and\r\norganized it. I believe it, too.\r\n\r\nFinally, they believe that she philosophized Christian Science,\r\nexplained it, systematized it, and wrote it all out with her own hand in\r\nthe book Science and Health.\r\n\r\nI am not able to believe that. Let us draw the line there. The known\r\nand undisputed products of her pen are a formidable witness against\r\nher. They do seem to me to prove, quite clearly and conclusively, that\r\nwriting, upon even simple subjects, is a difficult labor for her: that\r\nshe has never been able to write anything above third-rate English; that\r\nshe is weak in the matter of grammar; that she has but a rude and\r\ndull sense of the values of words; that she so lacks in the matter of\r\nliterary precision that she can seldom put a thought into words that\r\nexpress it lucidly to the reader and leave no doubts in his mind as to\r\nwhether he has rightly understood or not; that she cannot even draught a\r\nPreface that a person can fully comprehend, nor one which can by any\r\nart be translated into a fully understandable form; that she can\r\nseldom inject into a Preface even single sentences whose meaning is\r\nuncompromisingly clear--yet Prefaces are her specialty, if she has one.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eddy's known and undisputed writings are very limited in bulk;\r\nthey exhibit no depth, no analytical quality, no thought above school\r\ncomposition size, and but juvenile ability in handling thoughts of even\r\nthat modest magnitude. She has a fine commercial ability, and could\r\ngovern a vast railway system in great style; she could draught a set\r\nof rules that Satan himself would say could not be improved on--for\r\ndevilish effectiveness--by his staff; but we know, by our excursions\r\namong the Mother-Church's By-laws, that their English would discredit\r\nthe deputy baggage-smasher. I am quite sure that Mrs. Eddy cannot write\r\nwell upon any subject, even a commercial one.\r\n\r\nIn the very first revision of Science and Health (1883), Mrs. Eddy wrote\r\na Preface which is an unimpeachable witness that the rest of the book\r\nwas written by somebody else. I have put it in the Appendix along with a\r\npage or two taken from the body of the book, and will ask the reader to\r\ncompare the labored and lumbering and confused gropings of this Preface\r\nwith the easy and flowing and direct English of the other exhibit, and\r\nsee if he can believe that the one hand and brain produced both.\r\n\r\nAnd let him take the Preface apart, sentence by sentence, and\r\nsearchingly examine each sentence word by word, and see if he can find\r\nhalf a dozen sentences whose meanings he is so sure of that he can\r\nrephrase them--in words of his own--and reproduce what he takes to be\r\nthose meanings. Money can be lost on this game. I know, for I am the one\r\nthat lost it.\r\n\r\nNow let the reader turn to the excerpt which I have made from the\r\nchapter on \u201cPrayer\u201d (last year's edition of Science and Health), and\r\ncompare that wise and sane and elevated and lucid and compact piece of\r\nwork with the aforesaid Preface, and with Mrs. Eddy's poetry concerning\r\nthe gymnastic trees, and Minerva's not yet effete sandals, and the\r\nwreaths imported from Erudition's bower for the decoration of Plymouth\r\nRock, and the Plague-spot and Bacilli, and my other exhibits (turn back\r\nto my Chapters I. and II.) from the Autobiography, and finally with\r\nthe late Communication concerning me, and see if he thinks anybody's\r\naffirmation, or anybody's sworn testimony, or any other testimony of\r\nany imaginable kind would ever be likely to convince him that Mrs. Eddy\r\nwrote that chapter on Prayer.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to impose my opinion on any one who will not permit\r\nit, but such as it is I offer it here for what it is worth. I cannot\r\nbelieve, and I do not believe, that Mrs. Eddy originated any of the\r\nthoughts and reasonings out of which the book Science and Health is\r\nconstructed; and I cannot believe, and do not believe that she ever\r\nwrote any part of that book.\r\n\r\nI think that if anything in the world stands proven, and well and\r\nsolidly proven, by unimpeachable testimony--the treacherous testimony of\r\nher own pen in her known and undisputed literary productions--it is that\r\nMrs. Eddy is not capable of thinking upon high planes, nor of reasoning\r\nclearly nor writing intelligently upon low ones.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as--in my belief--the very first editions of the book Science\r\nand Health were far above the reach of Mrs. Eddy's mental and literary\r\nabilities, I think she has from the very beginning been claiming as\r\nher own another person's book, and wearing as her own property laurels\r\nrightfully belonging to that person--the real author of Science and\r\nHealth. And I think the reason--and the only reason--that he has not\r\nprotested is because his work was not exposed to print until after he\r\nwas safely dead.\r\n\r\nThat with an eye to business, and by grace of her business talent,\r\nshe has restored to the world neglected and abandoned features of the\r\nChristian religion which her thousands of followers find gracious and\r\nblessed and contenting, I recognize and confess; but I am convinced that\r\nevery single detail of the work except just that one--the delivery of\r\nthe Product to the world--was conceived and performed by another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\nORIGINAL FIRST PREFACE TO SCIENCE AND HEALTH\r\n\r\nThere seems a Christian necessity of learning God's power and purpose to\r\nheal both mind and body. This thought grew out of our early seeking\r\nHim in all our ways, and a hopeless as singular invalidism that drugs\r\nincreased instead of diminished, and hygiene benefited only for a\r\nseason. By degrees we have drifted into more spiritual latitudes of\r\nthought, and experimented as we advanced until demonstrating fully the\r\npower of mind over the body. About the year 1862, having heard of a\r\nmesmerist in Portland who was treating the sick by manipulation, we\r\nvisited him; he helped us for a time, then we relapsed somewhat. After\r\nhis decease, and a severe casualty deemed fatal by skilful physicians,\r\nwe discovered that the Principle of all healing and the law that governs\r\nit is God, a divine Principle, and a spiritual not material law, and\r\nregained health.\r\n\r\nIt was not an individual or mortal mind acting upon another so-called\r\nmind that healed us. It was the glorious truths of Christian Science\r\nthat we discovered as we neared that verge of so-called material life\r\nnamed death; yea, it was the great Shekinah, the spirit of Life, Truth,\r\nand Love illuminating our understanding of the action and might of\r\nOmnipotence! The old gentleman to whom we have referred had some very\r\nadvanced views on healing, but he was not avowedly religious neither\r\nscholarly. We interchanged thoughts on the subject of healing the sick.\r\nI restored some patients of his that he failed to heal, and left in\r\nhis possession some manuscripts of mine containing corrections of his\r\ndesultory pennings, which I am informed at his decease passed into the\r\nhands of a patient of his, now residing in Scotland. He died in 1865 and\r\nleft no published works. The only manuscript that we ever held of his,\r\nlonger than to correct it, was one of perhaps a dozen pages, most of\r\nwhich we had composed. He manipulated the sick; hence his ostensible\r\nmethod of healing was physical instead of mental.\r\n\r\nWe helped him in the esteem of the public by our writings, but never\r\nknew of his stating orally or in writing that he treated his patients\r\nmentally; never heard him give any directions to that effect; and have\r\nit from one of his patients, who now asserts that he was the founder of\r\nmental healing, that he never revealed to anyone his method. We refer\r\nto these facts simply to refute the calumnies and false claims of our\r\nenemies, that we are preferring dishonest claims to the discovery and\r\nfounding at this period of Metaphysical Healing or Christian Science.\r\n\r\nThe Science and laws of a purely mental healing and their method of\r\napplication through spiritual power alone, else a mental argument\r\nagainst disease, are our own discovery at this date. True, the Principle\r\nis divine and eternal, but the application of it to heal the sick had\r\nbeen lost sight of, and required to be again spiritually discerned\r\nand its science discovered, that man might retain it through the\r\nunderstanding. Since our discovery in 1866 of the divine science of\r\nChristian Healing, we have labored with tongue and pen to found this\r\nsystem. In this endeavor every obstacle has been thrown in our path that\r\nthe envy and revenge of a few disaffected students could devise. The\r\nsuperstition and ignorance of even this period have not failed to\r\ncontribute their mite towards misjudging us, while its Christian\r\nadvancement and scientific research have helped sustain our feeble\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nSince our first Edition of Science and Health, published in 1875, two\r\nof the aforesaid students have plagiarized and pirated our works. In the\r\nissues of E. J. A., almost exclusively ours, were thirteen paragraphs,\r\nwithout credit, taken verbatim from our books.\r\n\r\nNot one of our printed works was ever copied or abstracted from the\r\npublished or from the unpublished writings of anyone. Throughout our\r\npublications of Metaphysical Healing or Christian Science, when writing\r\nor dictating them, we have given ourselves to contemplation wholly apart\r\nfrom the observation of the material senses: to look upon a copy would\r\nhave distracted our thoughts from the subject before us. We were seldom\r\nable to copy our own compositions, and have employed an amanuensis\r\nfor the last six years. Every work that we have had published has been\r\nextemporaneously written; and out of fifty lectures and sermons that we\r\nhave delivered the last year, forty-four have been extemporaneous. We\r\nhave distributed many of our unpublished manuscripts; loaned to one of\r\nour youngest students, R. K--------y, between three and four hundred\r\npages, of which we were sole author--giving him liberty to copy but not\r\nto publish them.\r\n\r\nLeaning on the sustaining Infinite with loving trust, the trials of\r\nto-day grow brief, and to-morrow is big with blessings.\r\n\r\nThe wakeful shepherd, tending his flocks, beholds from the mountain's\r\ntop the first faint morning beam ere cometh the risen day. So from\r\nSoul's loftier summits shines the pale star to prophet-shepherd, and\r\nit traverses night, over to where the young child lies, in cradled\r\nobscurity, that shall waken a world. Over the night of error dawn the\r\nmorning beams and guiding star of Truth, and \u201cthe wise men\u201d are led by\r\nit to Science, which repeats the eternal harmony that it reproduced, in\r\nproof of immortality. The time for thinkers has come; and the time for\r\nrevolutions, ecclesiastical and civil, must come. Truth, independent of\r\ndoctrines or time-honored systems, stands at the threshold of history.\r\nContentment with the past, or the cold conventionality of custom, may no\r\nlonger shut the door on science; though empires fall, \u201cHe whose right it\r\nis shall reign.\u201d Ignorance of God should no longer be the stepping-stone\r\nto faith; understanding Him, \u201cwhom to know aright is Life eternal,\u201d is\r\nthe only guaranty of obedience.\r\n\r\nThis volume may not open a new thought, and make it at once familiar. It\r\nhas the sturdy task of a pioneer, to hack away at the tall oaks and cut\r\nthe rough granite, leaving future ages to declare what it has done.\r\nWe made our first discovery of the adaptation of metaphysics to the\r\ntreatment of disease in the winter of 1866; since then we have tested\r\nthe Principle on ourselves and others, and never found it to fail to\r\nprove the statements herein made of it. We must learn the science of\r\nLife, to reach the perfection of man. To understand God as the Principle\r\nof all being, and to live in accordance with this Principle, is the\r\nScience of Life. But to reproduce this harmony of being, the error\r\nof personal sense must yield to science, even as the science of music\r\ncorrects tones caught from the ear, and gives the sweet concord of\r\nsound. There are many theories of physic and theology, and many calls in\r\neach of their directions for the right way; but we propose to settle the\r\nquestion of \u201cWhat is Truth?\u201d on the ground of proof, and let that method\r\nof healing the sick and establishing Christianity be adopted that is\r\nfound to give the most health and to make the best Christians; science\r\nwill then have a fair field, in which case we are assured of its triumph\r\nover all opinions and beliefs. Sickness and sin have ever had their\r\ndoctors; but the question is, Have they become less because of them? The\r\nlongevity of our antediluvians would say, No! and the criminal records\r\nof today utter their voices little in favor of such a conclusion. Not\r\nthat we would deny to Caesar the things that are his, but that we\r\nask for the things that belong to Truth; and safely affirm, from the\r\ndemonstrations we have been able to make, that the science of man\r\nunderstood would have eradicated sin, sickness, and death, in a less\r\nperiod than six thousand years. We find great difficulties in starting\r\nthis work right. Some shockingly false claims are already made to a\r\nmetaphysical practice; mesmerism, its very antipodes, is one of them.\r\nHitherto we have never, in a single instance of our discovery, found\r\nthe slightest resemblance between mesmerism and metaphysics. No especial\r\nidiosyncrasy is requisite to acquire a knowledge of metaphysical\r\nhealing; spiritual sense is more important to its discernment than the\r\nintellect; and those who would learn this science without a high moral\r\nstandard of thought and action, will fail to understand it until they\r\ngo up higher. Owing to our explanations constantly vibrating between the\r\nsame points, an irksome repetition of words must occur; also the use of\r\ncapital letters, genders, and technicalities peculiar to the science.\r\nVariety of language, or beauty of diction, must give place to close\r\nanalysis and unembellished thought. \u201cHoping all things, enduring all\r\nthings,\u201d to do good to our enemies, to bless them that curse us, and to\r\nbear to the sorrowing and the sick consolation and healing, we commit\r\nthese pages to posterity.\r\n\r\nMARY BAKER G. EDDY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B\r\n\r\nThe Gospel narratives bear brief testimony even to the life of our great\r\nMaster. His spiritual noumenon and phenomenon, silenced portraiture.\r\nWriters, less wise than the Apostles, essayed in the Apocryphal New\r\nTestament, a legendary and traditional history of the early life of\r\nJesus. But Saint Paul summarized the character of Jesus as the model\r\nof Christianity, in these words: \u201cConsider Him who endured such\r\ncontradictions of sinners against Himself. Who for the joy that was set\r\nbefore Him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at\r\nthe right hand of the throne of God.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt may be that the mortal life battle still wages, and must continue\r\ntill its involved errors are vanquished by victory-bringing Science; but\r\nthis triumph will come! God is over all. He alone is our origin, aim,\r\nand Being. The real man is not of the dust, nor is he ever created\r\nthrough the flesh; for his father and mother are the one Spirit, and his\r\nbrethren are all the children of one parent, the eternal Good.\r\n\r\nAny kind of literary composition was excessively difficult for Mrs.\r\nEddy. She found it grinding hard work to dig out anything to say. She\r\nrealized, at the above stage in her life, that with all her trouble she\r\nhad not been able to scratch together even material enough for a child's\r\nAutobiography, and also that what she had secured was in the main not\r\nvaluable, not important, considering the age and the fame of the person\r\nshe was writing about; and so it occurred to her to attempt, in that\r\nparagraph, to excuse the meagreness and poor quality of the feast she\r\nwas spreading, by letting on that she could do ever so much better if\r\nshe wanted to, but was under constraint of Divine etiquette. To feed\r\nwith more than a few indifferent crumbs a plebeian appetite for personal\r\ndetails about Personages in her class was not the correct thing, and she\r\nblandly points out that there is Precedent for this reserve. When Mrs.\r\nEddy tries to be artful--in literature--it is generally after the manner\r\nof the ostrich; and with the ostrich's luck. Please try to find the\r\nconnection between the two paragraphs.--M. T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C\r\n\r\nThe following is the spiritual signification of the Lord's Prayer:\r\n\r\nPrinciple, eternal and harmonious, Nameless and adorable Intelligence,\r\nThou art ever present and supreme. And when this supremacy of\r\nSpirit shall appear, the dream of matter will disappear. Give us the\r\nunderstanding of Truth and Love. And loving we shall learn God, and\r\nTruth will destroy all error. And lead us unto the Life that is Soul,\r\nand deliver us from the errors of sense, sin, sickness, and death, For\r\nGod is Life, Truth, and Love for ever.--Science and Health, edition of\r\n1881.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that this one is distinctly superior to the one that was\r\ninspired for last year's edition. It is strange, but to my mind plain,\r\nthat inspiring is an art which does not improve with practice.--M. T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D\r\n\r\n\u201cFor verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain,\r\nBe thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in\r\nhis heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come\r\nto pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you,\r\nWhat things soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them,\r\nand ye shall have them.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask\r\nHim.\u201d--CHRIST JESUS.\r\n\r\nThe prayer that reclaims the sinner and heals the sick, is an absolute\r\nfaith that all things are possible to God--a spiritual understanding of\r\nHim--an unselfed love. Regardless of what another may say or think\r\non this subject, I speak from experience. This prayer, combined with\r\nself-sacrifice and toil, is the means whereby God has enabled me to do\r\nwhat I have done for the religion and health of mankind.\r\n\r\nThoughts unspoken are not unknown to the divine Mind. Desire is prayer;\r\nand no less can occur from trusting God with our desires, that they may\r\nbe moulded and exalted before they take form in audible word, and in\r\ndeeds.\r\n\r\nWhat are the motives for prayer? Do we pray to make ourselves better, or\r\nto benefit those that hear us; to enlighten the Infinite, or to be heard\r\nof men? Are we benefited by praying? Yes, the desire which goes forth\r\nhungering after righteousness is blessed of our Father, and it does not\r\nreturn unto us void.\r\n\r\nGod is not moved by the breath of praise to do more than He has already\r\ndone; nor can the Infinite do less than bestow all good, since He is\r\nunchanging Wisdom and Love. We can do more for ourselves by humble\r\nfervent petitions; but the All-loving does not grant them simply on the\r\nground of lip-service, for He already knows all.\r\n\r\nPrayer cannot change the Science of Being, but it does bring us into\r\nharmony with it. Goodness reaches the demonstration of Truth. A request\r\nthat another may work for us never does our work. The habit of pleading\r\nwith the divine Mind, as one pleads with a human being, perpetuates the\r\nbelief in God as humanly circumscribed--an error which impedes spiritual\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nGod is Love. Can we ask Him to be more? God is Intelligence. Can we\r\ninform the infinite Mind, or tell Him anything He does not already\r\ncomprehend? Do we hope to change perfection? Shall we plead for more\r\nat the open fount, which always pours forth more than we receive? The\r\nunspoken prayer does bring us nearer the Source of all existence and\r\nblessedness.\r\n\r\nAsking God to be God is a \u201cvain repetition.\u201d God is \u201cthe same yesterday,\r\nand to-day, and forever\u201d; and He who is immutably right will do right,\r\nwithout being reminded of His province. The wisdom of man is not\r\nsufficient to warrant him in advising God.\r\n\r\nWho would stand before a blackboard, and pray the principle of\r\nmathematics to work out the problem? The rule is already established,\r\nand it is our task to work out the solution. Shall we ask the divine\r\nPrinciple of all goodness to do His own work? His work is done; and\r\nwe have only to avail ourselves of God's rule, in order to receive the\r\nblessing thereof.\r\n\r\nThe divine Being must be reflected by man--else man is not the image and\r\nlikeness of the patient, tender, and true, the one \u201caltogether lovely\u201d;\r\nbut to understand God is the work of eternity, and demands absolute\r\nconcentration of thought and energy.\r\n\r\nHow empty are our conceptions of Deity! We admit theoretically that\r\nGod is good, omnipotent, omnipresent, infinite, and then we try to give\r\ninformation to this infinite Mind; and plead for unmerited pardon, and a\r\nliberal outpouring of benefactions. Are we really grateful for the good\r\nalready received? Then we shall avail ourselves of the blessings we\r\nhave, and thus be fitted to receive more. Gratitude is much more than a\r\nverbal expression of thanks. Action expresses more gratitude than speech.\r\n\r\nIf we are ungrateful for Life, Truth, and Love, and yet return thanks to\r\nGod for all blessings, we are insincere; and incur the sharp censure\r\nour Master pronounces on hypocrites. In such a case the only acceptable\r\nprayer is to put the finger on the lips and remember our blessings.\r\nWhile the heart is far from divine Truth and Love, we cannot conceal the\r\ningratitude of barren lives, for God knoweth all things.\r\n\r\nWhat we most need is the prayer of fervent desire for growth in grace,\r\nexpressed in patience, meekness, love, and good deeds. To keep the\r\ncommandments of our Master and follow his example, is our proper debt to\r\nHim, and the only worthy evidence of our gratitude for all He has\r\ndone. Outward worship is not of itself sufficient to express loyal\r\nand heartfelt gratitude, since He has said: \u201cIf ye love Me, keep My\r\nCommandments.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe habitual struggle to be always good, is unceasing prayer. Its\r\nmotives are made manifest in the blessings they bring--which, if\r\nnot acknowledged in audible words, attest our worthiness to be made\r\npartakers of Love.\r\n\r\nSimply asking that we may love God will never make us love Him; but the\r\nlonging to be better and holier--expressed in daily watchfulness, and in\r\nstriving to assimilate more of the divine character--this will mould and\r\nfashion us anew, until we awake in His likeness. We reach the Science\r\nof Christianity through demonstration of the divine nature; but in this\r\nwicked world goodness will \u201cbe evil spoken of,\u201d and patience must work\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nAudible prayer can never do the works of spiritual understanding, which\r\nregenerates; but silent prayer, watchfulness, and devout obedience,\r\nenable us to follow Jesus' example. Long prayers, ecclesiasticism, and\r\ncreeds, have clipped the divine pinions of Love, and clad religion in\r\nhuman robes. They materialize worship, hinder the Spirit, and keep man\r\nfrom demonstrating his power over error.\r\n\r\nSorrow for wrong-doing is but one step towards reform, and the very\r\neasiest step. The next and great step required by Wisdom is the test of\r\nour sincerity--namely, reformation. To this end we are placed under the\r\nstress of circumstances. Temptation bids us repeat the offence, and woe\r\ncomes in return for what is done. So it will ever be, till we learn that\r\nthere is no discount in the law of justice, and that we must pay \u201cthe\r\nuttermost farthing.\u201d The measure ye mete \u201cshall be measured to you\r\nagain,\u201d and it will be full \u201cand running over.\u201d\r\n\r\nSaints and sinners get their full award, but not always in this world.\r\nThe followers of Christ drank His cup. Ingratitude and persecution\r\nfilled it to the brim; but God pours the riches of His love into the\r\nunderstanding and affections, giving us strength according to our day.\r\nSinners flourish \u201clike a green bay-tree\u201d; but, looking farther, the\r\nPsalmist could see their end--namely, the destruction of sin through\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nPrayer is sometimes used, as a confessional to cancel sin. This error\r\nimpedes true religion. Sin is forgiven, only as it is destroyed by\r\nChrist-Truth and Life. If prayer nourishes the belief that sin is\r\ncancelled, and that man is made better by merely praying, it is an evil.\r\nHe grows worse who continues in sin because he thinks himself forgiven.\r\n\r\nAn apostle says that the Son of God (Christ) came to \u201cdestroy the\r\nworks of the devil.\u201d We should follow our divine Exemplar, and seek the\r\ndestruction of all evil works, error and disease included. We cannot\r\nescape the penalty due for sin. The Scriptures say, that if we deny\r\nChrist, \u201cHe also will deny us.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe divine Love corrects and governs man. Men may pardon, but this\r\ndivine Principle alone reforms the sinner. God is not separate from the\r\nwisdom He bestows. The talents He gives we must improve. Calling on\r\nHim to forgive our work, badly done or left undone, implies the vain\r\nsupposition that we have nothing to do but to ask pardon, and that\r\nafterwards we shall be free to repeat the offence.\r\n\r\nTo cause suffering, as the result of sin, is the means of destroying\r\nsin. Every supposed pleasure in sin will furnish more than its\r\nequivalent of pain, until belief in material life and sin is destroyed.\r\nTo reach heaven, the harmony of Being, we must understand the divine\r\nPrinciple of Being.\r\n\r\n\u201cGod is Love.\u201d More than this we cannot ask; higher we cannot look;\r\nfarther we cannot go. To suppose that God forgives or punishes sin,\r\naccording as His mercy is sought or unsought, is to misunderstand Love\r\nand make prayer the safety-valve for wrong-doing.\r\n\r\nJesus uncovered and rebuked sin before He cast it out. Of a sick woman\r\nHe said that Satan had bound her; and to Peter He said, \u201cThou art an\r\noffense unto me.\u201d He came teaching and showing men how to destroy sin,\r\nsickness, and death. He said of the fruitless tree, \u201cIt is hewn down.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt is believed by many that a certain magistrate, who lived in the time\r\nof Jesus, left this record: \u201cHis rebuke is fearful.\u201d The strong language\r\nof our Master confirms this description.\r\n\r\nThe only civil sentence which He had for error was, \u201cGet thee behind\r\nMe, Satan.\u201d Still stronger evidence that Jesus' reproof was pointed and\r\npungent is in His own words--showing the necessity for such forcible\r\nutterance, when He cast out devils and healed the sick and sinful. The\r\nrelinquishment of error deprives material sense of its false claims.\r\n\r\nAudible prayer is impressive; it gives momentary solemnity and elevation\r\nto thought; but does it produce any lasting benefit? Looking deeply into\r\nthese things, we find that \u201ca zeal... not according to knowledge,\u201d gives\r\noccasion for reaction unfavorable to spiritual growth, sober resolve,\r\nand wholesome perception of God's requirements. The motives for verbal\r\nprayer may embrace too much love of applause to induce or encourage\r\nChristian sentiment.\r\n\r\nPhysical sensation, not Soul, produces material ecstasy, and emotions.\r\nIf spiritual sense always guided men at such times, there would grow out\r\nof those ecstatic moments a higher experience and a better life, with\r\nmore devout self-abnegation, and purity. A self-satisfied ventilation\r\nof fervent sentiments never makes a Christian. God is not influenced by\r\nman. The \u201cdivine ear\u201d is not an auditorial nerve. It is the all-hearing\r\nand all-knowing Mind, to whom each want of man is always known, and by\r\nwhom it will be supplied.\r\n\r\nThe danger from audible prayer is, that it may lead us into temptation.\r\nBy it we may become involuntary hypocrites, uttering desires which\r\nare not real, and consoling ourselves in the midst of sin, with the\r\nrecollection that we have prayed over it--or mean to ask forgiveness at\r\nsome later day. Hypocrisy is fatal to religion.\r\n\r\nA wordy prayer may afford a quiet sense of self-justification, though it\r\nmakes the sinner a hypocrite. We never need despair of an honest heart,\r\nbut there is little hope for those who only come spasmodically face to\r\nface with their wickedness, and then seek to hide it. Their prayers are\r\nindexes which do not correspond with their character. They hold secret\r\nfellowship with sin; and such externals are spoken of by Jesus as \u201clike\r\nunto whited sepulchres... full of all uncleanness.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf a man, though apparently fervent and prayerful, is impure, and\r\ntherefore insincere, what must be the comment upon him? If he had\r\nreached the loftiness of his prayer, there would be no occasion for such\r\ncomment. If we feel the aspiration, humility, gratitude, and love\r\nwhich our words express--this God accepts; and it is wise not to try to\r\ndeceive ourselves or others, for \u201cthere is nothing covered that shall\r\nnot be revealed.\u201d Professions and audible prayers are like charity in\r\none respect--they \u201ccover a multitude of sins.\u201d Praying for humility,\r\nwith whatever fervency of expression, does not always mean a desire\r\nfor it. If we turn away from the poor, we are not ready to receive the\r\nreward of Him who blesses the poor. We confess to having a very wicked\r\nheart, and ask that it may be laid bare before us; but do we not already\r\nknow more of this heart than we are willing to have our neighbor see?\r\n\r\nWe ought to examine ourselves, and learn what is the affection and\r\npurpose of the heart; for this alone can show us what we honestly are.\r\nIf a friend informs us of a fault, do we listen to the rebuke patiently,\r\nand credit what is said? Do we not rather give thanks that we are \u201cnot\r\nas other men?\u201d During many years the author has been most grateful for\r\nmerited rebuke. The sting lies in unmerited censure--in the falsehood\r\nwhich does no one any good.\r\n\r\nThe test of all prayer lies in the answer to these questions: Do we\r\nlove our neighbor better because of this asking? Do we pursue the old\r\nselfishness, satisfied with having prayed for something better,\r\nthough we give no evidence of the sincerity of our requests by living\r\nconsistently with our prayer? If selfishness has given place to\r\nkindness, we shall regard our neighbor unselfishly, and bless them that\r\ncurse us; but we shall never meet this great duty by simply asking that\r\nit may be done. There is a cross to be taken up, before we can enjoy the\r\nfruition of our hope and faith.\r\n\r\nDost thou \u201clove the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy\r\nsoul, and with all thy mind?\u201d This command includes much--even the\r\nsurrender of all merely material sensation, affection, and worship. This\r\nis the El Dorado of Christianity. It involves the Science of Life,\r\nand recognizes only the divine control of Spirit, wherein Soul is our\r\nmaster, and material sense and human will have no place.\r\n\r\nAre you willing to leave all for Christ, for Truth, and so be counted\r\namong sinners? No! Do you really desire to attain this point? No! Then\r\nwhy make long prayers about it, and ask to be Christians, since you care\r\nnot to tread in the footsteps of our dear Master? If unwilling to follow\r\nHis example, wherefore pray with the lips that you may be partakers of\r\nHis nature? Consistent prayer is the desire to do right. Prayer means\r\nthat we desire to, and will, walk in the light so far as we receive it,\r\neven though with bleeding footsteps, and waiting patiently on the Lord,\r\nwill leave our real desires to be rewarded by Him.\r\n\r\nThe world must grow to the spiritual understanding of prayer. If good\r\nenough to profit by Jesus' cup of earthly sorrows, God will sustain us\r\nunder these sorrows. Until we are thus divinely qualified, and willing\r\nto drink His cup, millions of vain repetitions will never pour into\r\nprayer the unction of Spirit, in demonstration of power, and \u201cwith signs\r\nfollowing.\u201d Christian Science reveals a necessity for overcoming the\r\nworld, the flesh and evil, and thus destroying all error.\r\n\r\nSeeking is not sufficient. It is striving which enables us to enter.\r\nSpiritual attainments open the door to a higher understanding of the\r\ndivine Life.\r\n\r\nOne of the forms of worship in Thibet is to carry a praying-machine\r\nthrough the streets, and stop at the doors to earn a penny by grinding\r\nout a prayer; whereas civilization pays for clerical prayers, in lofty\r\nedifices. Is the difference very great, after all?\r\n\r\nExperience teaches us that we do not always receive the blessings we ask\r\nfor in prayer.\r\n\r\nThere is some misapprehension of the source and means of all goodness\r\nand blessedness, or we should certainly receive what we ask for. The\r\nScriptures say: \u201cYe ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye\r\nmay consume it upon your lusts.\u201d What we desire and ask for it is not\r\nalways best for us to receive. In this case infinite Love will not grant\r\nthe request. Do you ask Wisdom to be merciful and not punish sin? Then\r\n\u201cye ask amiss.\u201d Without punishment, sin would multiply. Jesus' prayer,\r\n\u201cforgive us our debts,\u201d specified also the terms of forgiveness. When\r\nforgiving the adulterous woman He said, \u201cGo, and sin no more.\u201d\r\n\r\nA magistrate sometimes remits the penalty, but this may be no moral\r\nbenefit to the criminal; and at best, it only saves him from one form\r\nof punishment. The moral law, which has the right to acquit or condemn,\r\nalways demands restitution, before mortals can \u201cgo up higher.\u201d Broken\r\nlaw brings penalty, in order to compel this progress.\r\n\r\nMere legal pardon (and there is no other, for divine Principle never\r\npardons our sins or mistakes till they are corrected) leaves the\r\noffender free to repeat the offense; if, indeed, he has not already\r\nsuffered sufficiently from vice to make him turn from it with loathing.\r\nTruth bestows no pardon upon error, but wipes it out in the most\r\neffectual manner. Jesus suffered for our sins, not to annul the divine\r\nsentence against an individual's sin, but to show that sin must bring\r\ninevitable suffering.\r\n\r\nPetitions only bring to mortals the results of their own faith. We know\r\nthat a desire for holiness is requisite in order to gain it; but if we\r\ndesire holiness above all else, we shall sacrifice everything for it.\r\nWe must be willing to do this, that we may walk securely in the only\r\npractical road to holiness. Prayer alone cannot change the unalterable\r\nTruth, or give us an understanding of it; but prayer coupled with a\r\nfervent habitual desire to know and do the will of God will bring us\r\ninto all Truth. Such a desire has little need of audible expression. It\r\nis best expressed in thought and life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E\r\n\r\nReverend Heber Newton on Christian Science:\r\n\r\nTo begin, then, at the beginning, Christian Science accepts the work\r\nof healing sickness as an integral part of the discipleship of Jesus\r\nChrist. In Christ it finds, what the Church has always recognized,\r\ntheoretically, though it has practically ignored the fact--the Great\r\nPhysician. That Christ healed the sick, we none of us question. It\r\nstands plainly upon the record. This ministry of healing was too large\r\na part of His work to be left out from any picture of that life. Such\r\nservice was not an incident of His career--it was an essential\r\nelement of that career. It was an integral factor in His mission. The\r\nEvangelists leave us no possibility of confusion on this point. Co-equal\r\nwith his work of instruction and inspiration was His work of healing.\r\n\r\nThe records make it equally clear that the Master laid His charge upon\r\nHis disciples to do as He had done. \u201cWhen He had called unto Him His\r\ntwelve disciples, He gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them\r\nout, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.\u201d In\r\nsending them forth, \u201cHe commanded them, saying,... As ye go, preach,\r\nsaying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the\r\nlepers, raise the dead, cast out demons.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat the twelve disciples undertook to do the Master's work of healing,\r\nand that they, in their measure, succeeded, seems beyond question. They\r\nfound in themselves the same power that the Master found in Himself,\r\nand they used it as He had used His power. The record of The Acts of the\r\nApostles, if at all trustworthy history, shows that they, too, healed\r\nthe sick.\r\n\r\nBeyond the circle of the original twelve, it is equally clear that the\r\nearly disciples believed themselves charged with the same mission, and\r\nthat they sought to fulfil it. The records of the early Church make it\r\nindisputable that powers of healing were recognized as among the gifts\r\nof the Spirit. St. Paul's letters render it certain that these gifts\r\nwere not a privilege of the original twelve, merely, but that they were\r\nthe heritage into which all the disciples entered.\r\n\r\nBeyond the era of the primitive Church, through several generations, the\r\nearly Christians felt themselves called to the same ministry of healing,\r\nand enabled with the same secret of power. Through wellnigh three\r\ncenturies, the gifts of healing appear to have been, more or less,\r\nrecognized and exercised in the Church. Through those generations,\r\nhowever, there was a gradual disuse of this power, following upon a\r\nfailing recognition of its possession. That which was originally the\r\nrule became the exception. By degrees, the sense of authority and power\r\nto heal passed out from the consciousness of the Church. It ceased to be\r\na sign of the indwelling Spirit. For fifteen centuries, the recognition\r\nof this authority and power has been altogether exceptional. Here and\r\nthere, through the history of these centuries, there have been those who\r\nhave entered into this belief of their own privilege and duty, and have\r\nused the gift which they recognized. The Church has never been left\r\nwithout a line of witnesses to this aspect of the discipleship of\r\nChrist. But she has come to accept it as the normal order of things that\r\nwhat was once the rule in the Christian Church should be now only\r\nthe exception. Orthodoxy has framed a theory of the words of Jesus to\r\naccount for this strange departure of His Church from them. It teaches\r\nus to believe that His example was not meant to be followed, in this\r\nrespect, by all His disciples. The power of healing which was in Him\r\nwas a purely exceptional power. It was used as an evidence of His divine\r\nmission. It was a miraculous gift. The gift of working miracles was not\r\nbestowed upon His Church at large. His original disciples, the twelve\r\napostles, received this gift, as a necessity of the critical epoch of\r\nChristianity--the founding of the Church. Traces of the power lingered\r\non, in weakening activity, until they gradually ceased, and the normal\r\ncondition of the Church was entered upon, in which miracles are no\r\nlonger possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe accept this, unconsciously, as the true state of things in\r\nChristianity. But it is a conception which will not bear a moment's\r\nexamination. There is not the slightest suggestion upon record that\r\nChrist set any limit to this charge which He gave His disciples. On the\r\ncontrary, there are not lacking hints that He looked for the possession\r\nand exercise of this power wherever His spirit breathed in men.\r\n\r\nEven if the concluding paragraph of St. Mark's Gospel were a later\r\nappendix, it may none the less have been a faithful echo of words of\r\nthe Master, as it certainly is a trustworthy record of the belief of the\r\nearly Christians as to the thought of Jesus concerning His followers.\r\nIn that interesting passage, Jesus, after His death, appeared to the\r\neleven, and formally commissioned them, again, to take up His work in\r\nthe world; bidding them, \u201cGo ye into all the world and preach the gospel\r\nto every creature.\u201d \u201cAnd these signs,\u201d He tells them, \u201cshall follow them\r\nthat believe\u201d--not the apostles only, but \u201cthem that believe,\u201d without\r\nlimit of time; \u201cin My name they shall cast out devils... they shall lay\r\nhands on the sick and they shall recover.\u201d The concluding discourse to\r\nthe disciples, recorded in the Gospel according to St. John, affirms the\r\nsame expectation on the part of Jesus; emphasizing it in His solemn way:\r\n\u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on Me, the works that\r\nI do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX F\r\n\r\nFew will deny that an intelligence apart from man formed and governs the\r\nspiritual universe and man; and this intelligence is the eternal\r\nMind, and neither matter nor man created this intelligence and divine\r\nPrinciple; nor can this Principle produce aught unlike itself. All that\r\nwe term sin, sickness, and death is comprised in the belief of matter.\r\nThe realm of the real is spiritual; the opposite of Spirit is matter;\r\nand the opposite of the real is unreal or material. Matter is an error\r\nof statement, for there is no matter. This error of premises leads to\r\nerror of conclusion in every statement of matter as a basis. Nothing\r\nwe can say or believe regarding matter is true, except that matter is\r\nunreal, simply a belief that has its beginning and ending.\r\n\r\nThe conservative firm called matter and mind God never formed. The\r\nunerring and eternal Mind destroys this imaginary copartnership,\r\nformed only to be dissolved in a manner and at a period unknown. This\r\ncopartnership is obsolete. Placed under the microscope of metaphysics\r\nmatter disappears. Only by understanding there are not two, matter\r\nand mind, is a logical and correct conclusion obtained by either one.\r\nScience gathers not grapes of thorns or figs of thistles. Intelligence\r\nnever produced non-intelligence, such as matter: the immortal never\r\nproduced mortality, good never resulted in evil. The science of Mind\r\nshows conclusively that matter is a myth. Metaphysics are above physics,\r\nand drag not matter, or what is termed that, into one of its premises\r\nor conclusions. Metaphysics resolves things into thoughts, and exchanges\r\nthe objects of sense for the ideas of Soul. These ideas are perfectly\r\ntangible and real to consciousness, and they have this advantage--they\r\nare eternal. Mind and its thoughts comprise the whole of God, the\r\nuniverse, and of man. Reason and revelation coincide with this\r\nstatement, and support its proof every hour, for nothing is harmonious\r\nor eternal that is not spiritual: the realization of this will bring\r\nout objects from a higher source of thought; hence more beautiful and\r\nimmortal.\r\n\r\nThe fact of spiritualization produces results in striking contrast to\r\nthe farce of materialization: the one produces the results of chastity\r\nand purity, the other the downward tendencies and earthward gravitation\r\nof sensualism and impurity.\r\n\r\nThe exalting and healing effects of metaphysics show their fountain.\r\nNothing in pathology has exceeded the application of metaphysics.\r\nThrough mind alone we have prevented disease and preserved health. In\r\ncases of chronic and acute diseases, in their severest forms, we have\r\nchanged the secretions, renewed structure, and restored health; have\r\nelongated shortened limbs, relaxed rigid muscles, made cicatrized joints\r\nsupple; restored carious bones to healthy conditions, renewed that\r\nwhich is termed the lost substance of the lungs; and restored healthy\r\norganizations where disease was organic instead of functional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. EDDY IN ERROR\r\n\r\nI feel almost sure that Mrs. Eddy's inspiration--works are getting out\r\nof repair. I think so because they made some errors in a statement which\r\nshe uttered through the press on the 17th of January. Not large ones,\r\nperhaps, still it is a friend's duty to straighten such things out and\r\nget them right when he can. Therefore I will put my other duties aside\r\nfor a moment and undertake this helpful service. She said as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201cIn view of the circulation of certain criticisms from the pen of Mark\r\nTwain, I submit the following statement:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a fact, well understood, that I begged the students who first\r\ngave me the endearing appellative 'mother' not to name me thus. But,\r\nwithout my consent, that word spread like wildfire. I still must think\r\nthe name is not applicable to me. I stand in relation to this century as\r\na Christian discoverer, founder, and leader. I regard self-deification\r\nas blasphemous; I may be more loved, but I am less lauded, pampered,\r\nprovided for, and cheered than others before me--and wherefore? Because\r\nChristian Science is not yet popular, and I refuse adulation.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy visit to the Mother-Church after it was built and dedicated pleased\r\nme, and the situation was satisfactory. The dear members wanted to greet\r\nme with escort and the ringing of bells, but I declined, and went alone\r\nin my carriage to the church, entered it, and knelt in thanks upon the\r\nsteps of its altar. There the foresplendor of the beginnings of truth\r\nfell mysteriously upon my spirit. I believe in one Christ, teach one\r\nChrist, know of but one Christ. I believe in but one incarnation, one\r\nMother Mary, and know I am not that one, and never claimed to be. It\r\nsuffices me to learn the Science of the Scriptures relative to this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\u201cChristian Scientists have no quarrel with Protestants, Catholics,\r\nor any other sect. They need to be understood as following the divine\r\nPrinciple God, Love and not imagined to be unscientific worshippers of a\r\nhuman being.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the aforesaid article, of which I have seen only extracts, Mark\r\nTwain's wit was not wasted In certain directions. Christian Science\r\neschews divine rights in human beings. If the individual governed human\r\nconsciousness, my statement of Christian Science would be disproved, but\r\nto understand the spiritual idea is essential to demonstrate Science\r\nand its pure monotheism--one God, one Christ, no idolatry, no human\r\npropaganda. Jesus taught and proved that what feeds a few feeds all. His\r\nlife-work subordinated the material to the spiritual, and He left\r\nthis legacy of truth to mankind. His metaphysics is not the sport of\r\nphilosophy, religion, or Science; rather it is the pith and finale of\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have not the inspiration or aspiration to be a first or second\r\nVirgin-Mother--her duplicate, antecedent, or subsequent. What I am\r\nremains to be proved by the good I do. We need much humility, wisdom,\r\nand love to perform the functions of foreshadowing and foretasting\r\nheaven within us. This glory is molten in the furnace of affliction.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe still thinks the name of Our Mother not applicable to her; and she\r\nis also able to remember that it distressed her when it was conferred\r\nupon her, and that she begged to have it suppressed. Her memory is at\r\nfault here. If she will take her By-laws, and refer to Section 1 of\r\nArticle XXII., written with her own hand--she will find that she has\r\nreserved that title to herself, and is so pleased with it, and so--may\r\nwe say jealous?--about it, that she threatens with excommunication any\r\nsister Scientist who shall call herself by it. This is that Section 1:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Title of Mother. In the year 1895 loyal Christian Scientists\r\nhad given to the author of their text-book, the Founder of Christian\r\nScience, the individual, endearing term of Mother. Therefore, if a\r\nstudent of Christian Science shall apply this title, either to herself\r\nor to others, except as the term for kinship according to the flesh, it\r\nshall be regarded by the Church as an indication of disrespect for their\r\nPastor Emeritus, and unfitness to be a member of the Mother-Church.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Eddy is herself the Mother-Church--its powers and authorities are\r\nin her possession solely--and she can abolish that title whenever it may\r\nplease her to do so. She has only to command her people, wherever they\r\nmay be in the earth, to use it no more, and it will never be uttered\r\nagain. She is aware of this.\r\n\r\nIt may be that she \u201crefuses adulation\u201d when she is not awake, but when\r\nshe is awake she encourages it and propagates it in that museum called\r\n\u201cOur Mother's Room,\u201d in her Church in Boston. She could abolish that\r\ninstitution with a word, if she wanted to. She is aware of that. I will\r\nsay a further word about the museum presently.\r\n\r\nFurther down the column, her memory is unfaithful again:\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe in... but one Mother Mary, and know I am not that one, and\r\nnever claimed to be.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt a session of the National Christian Science Association, held in the\r\ncity of New York on the 27th of May, 1890, the secretary was \u201cinstructed\r\nto send to our Mother greetings and words of affection from her\r\nassembled children.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer telegraphic response was read to the Association at next day's\r\nmeeting:\r\n\r\n\u201cAll hail! He hath filled the hungry with good things and the sick hath\r\nHe not sent empty away.--MOTHER MARY.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhich Mother Mary is this one? Are there two? If so, she is both\r\nof them; for, when she signed this telegram in this satisfied and\r\nunprotesting way, the Mother-title which she was going to so strenuously\r\nobject to, and put from her with humility, and seize with both hands,\r\nand reserve as her sole property, and protect her monopoly of it with\r\na stern By-law, while recognizing with diffidence that it was \u201cnot\r\napplicable\u201d to her (then and to-day)--that Mother--title was not yet\r\nborn, and would not be offered to her until five years later. The date\r\nof the above \u201cMother Mary\u201d is 1890; the \u201cindividual, endearing title of\r\nMother\u201d was given her \u201cin 1895\u201d--according to her own testimony. See her\r\nBy-law quoted above.\r\n\r\nIn his opening Address to that Convention of 1890, the President\r\nrecognized this Mary--our Mary-and abolished all previous ones. He said:\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is but one Moses, one Jesus; and there is but one Mary.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe confusions being now dispersed, we have this clarified result:\r\n\r\nThere had been a Moses at one time, and only one; there had been a Jesus\r\nat one time, and only one; there is a Mary and \u201conly one.\u201d She is not a\r\nHas Been, she is an Is--the \u201cAuthor of Science and Health; and we cannot\r\nignore her.\u201d\r\n\r\n1. In 1890, there was but one Mother Mary. The President said so. 2.\r\nMrs. Eddy was that one. She said so, in signing the telegram. 3. Mrs.\r\nEddy was not that one for she says so, in her Associated Press utterance\r\nof January 17th. 4. And has \u201cnever claimed to be that one\u201d--unless the\r\nsignature to the telegram is a claim.\r\n\r\nThus it stands proven and established that she is that Mary and isn't,\r\nand thought she was and knows she wasn't. That much is clear.\r\n\r\nShe is also \u201cThe Mother,\u201d by the election of 1895, and did not want the\r\ntitle, and thinks it is not applicable to her, and will excommunicate\r\nany one that tries to take it away from her. So that is clear.\r\n\r\nI think that the only really troublesome confusion connected with these\r\nparticular matters has arisen from the name Mary. Much vexation, much\r\nmisunderstanding, could have been avoided if Mrs. Eddy had used some of\r\nher other names in place of that one. \u201cMother Mary\u201d was certain to stir\r\nup discussion. It would have been much better if she had signed\r\nthe telegram \u201cMother Baker\u201d; then there would have been no Biblical\r\ncompetition, and, of course, that is a thing to avoid. But it is not too\r\nlate, yet.\r\n\r\nI wish to break in here with a parenthesis, and then take up this\r\nexamination of Mrs. Eddy's Claim of January 17th again.\r\n\r\nThe history of her \u201cMother Mary\u201d telegram--as told to me by one who\r\nought to be a very good authority--is curious and interesting. The\r\ntelegram ostensibly quotes verse 53 from the \u201cMagnificat,\u201d but really\r\nmakes some pretty formidable changes in it. This is St. Luke's version:\r\n\r\n\u201cHe hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He hath sent\r\nempty away.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is \u201cMother Mary's\u201d telegraphed version:\r\n\r\n\u201cHe hath filled the hungry with good things, and the sick hath He not\r\nsent empty away.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo judge by the Official Report, the bursting of this bombshell in that\r\nmassed convention of trained Christians created no astonishment, since\r\nit caused no remark, and the business of the convention went tranquilly\r\non, thereafter, as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nDid those people detect those changes? We cannot know. I think they must\r\nhave noticed them, the wording of St. Luke's verse being as familiar to\r\nall Christians as is the wording of the Beatitudes; and I think that the\r\nreason the new version provoked no surprise and no comment was, that the\r\nassemblage took it for a \u201cKey\u201d--a spiritualized explanation of verse 53,\r\nnewly sent down from heaven through Mrs. Eddy. For all Scientists study\r\ntheir Bibles diligently, and they know their Magnificat. I believe that\r\ntheir confidence in the authenticity of Mrs. Eddy's inspirations is so\r\nlimitless and so firmly established that no change, however violent,\r\nwhich she might make in a Bible text could disturb their composure or\r\nprovoke from them a protest.\r\n\r\nHer improved rendition of verse 53 went into the convention's report and\r\nappeared in a New York paper the next day. The (at that time) Scientist\r\nwhom I mentioned a minute ago, and who had not been present at the\r\nconvention, saw it and marvelled; marvelled and was indignant--indignant\r\nwith the printer or the telegrapher, for making so careless and so\r\ndreadful an error. And greatly distressed, too; for, of course, the\r\nnewspaper people would fall foul of it, and be sarcastic, and make fun\r\nof it, and have a blithe time over it, and be properly thankful for the\r\nchance. It shows how innocent he was; it shows that he did not know the\r\nlimitations of newspaper men in the matter of Biblical knowledge. The\r\nnew verse 53 raised no insurrection in the press; in fact, it was not\r\neven remarked upon; I could have told him the boys would not know there\r\nwas anything the matter with it. I have been a newspaper man myself, and\r\nin those days I had my limitations like the others.\r\n\r\nThe Scientist hastened to Concord and told Mrs. Eddy what a disastrous\r\nmistake had been made, but he found to his bewilderment that she was\r\ntranquil about it, and was not proposing to correct it. He was not able\r\nto get her to promise to make a correction. He asked her secretary if\r\nhe had heard aright when the telegram was dictated to him; the secretary\r\nsaid he had, and took the filed copy of it and verified its authenticity\r\nby comparing it with the stenographic notes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eddy did make the correction, two months later, in her official\r\norgan. It attracted no attention among the Scientists; and, naturally,\r\nnone elsewhere, for that periodical's circulation was practically\r\nconfined to disciples of the cult.\r\n\r\nThat is the tale as it was told to me by an ex-Scientist. Verse\r\n53--renovated and spiritualized--had a narrow escape from a tremendous\r\ncelebrity. The newspaper men would have made it as famous as the\r\nassassination of Caesar, but for their limitations.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Claim. I find myself greatly embarrassed by Mrs. Eddy's\r\nremark: \u201cI regard self-deification as blasphemous.\u201d If she is right\r\nabout that, I have written a half-ream of manuscript this past week\r\nwhich I must not print, either in the book which I am writing, or\r\nelsewhere: for it goes into that very matter with extensive elaboration,\r\nciting, in detail, words and acts of Mrs. Eddy's which seem to me to\r\nprove that she is a faithful and untiring worshipper of herself, and has\r\ncarried self-deification to a length which has not been before ventured\r\nin ages. If ever. There is not room enough in this chapter for that\r\nSurvey, but I can epitomize a portion of it here.\r\n\r\nWith her own untaught and untrained mind, and without outside help,\r\nshe has erected upon a firm and lasting foundation the most minutely\r\nperfect, and wonderful, and smoothly and exactly working, and best\r\nsafe-guarded system of government that has yet been devised in the\r\nworld, as I believe, and as I am sure I could prove if I had room for my\r\ndocumentary evidences here.\r\n\r\nIt is a despotism (on this democratic soil); a sovereignty more absolute\r\nthan the Roman Papacy, more absolute than the Russian Czarship; it has\r\nnot a single power, not a shred of authority, legislative or executive,\r\nwhich is not lodged solely in the sovereign; all its dreams, its\r\nfunctions, its energies, have a single object, a single reason for\r\nexisting, and only the one--to build to the sky the glory of the\r\nsovereign, and keep it bright to the end of time.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eddy is the sovereign; she devised that great place for herself,\r\nshe occupies that throne.\r\n\r\nIn 1895, she wrote a little primer, a little body of autocratic laws,\r\ncalled the Manual of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and put\r\nthose laws in force, in permanence. Her government is all there; all\r\nin that deceptively innocent-looking little book, that cunning little\r\ndevilish book, that slumbering little brown volcano, with hell in its\r\nbowels. In that book she has planned out her system, and classified and\r\ndefined its purposes and powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIN PARTS OF THE MACHINE\r\n\r\nA Supreme Church. At Boston. Branch Churches. All over the world One\r\nPastor for the whole of them: to wit, her book, Science and Health. Term\r\nof the book's office--forever.\r\n\r\nIn every C.S. pulpit, two \u201cReaders,\u201d a man and a woman. No talkers,\r\nno preachers, in any Church-readers only. Readers of the Bible and her\r\nbooks--no others. No commentators allowed to write or print.\r\n\r\nA Church Service. She has framed it--for all the C.S. Churches--selected\r\nits readings, its prayers, and the hymns to be used, and has appointed\r\nthe order of procedure. No changes permitted.\r\n\r\nA Creed. She wrote it. All C.S. Churches must subscribe to it. No other\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\nA Treasury. At Boston. She carries the key.\r\n\r\nA C.S. Book--Publishing House. For books approved by her. No others\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\nJournals and Magazines. These are organs of hers, and are controlled by\r\nher.\r\n\r\nA College. For teaching C.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF THE MACHINE'S POWERS AND DIGNITIES\r\n\r\nSupreme Church. Pastor Emeritus--Mrs. Eddy. Board of Directors. Board\r\nof Education. Board of Finance. College Faculty. Various Committees.\r\nTreasurer. Clerk. First Members (of the Supreme Church). Members of the\r\nSupreme Church.\r\n\r\nIt looks fair, it looks real, but it is all a fiction.\r\n\r\nEven the little \u201cPastor Emeritus\u201d is a fiction. Instead of being merely\r\nan honorary and ornamental official, Mrs. Eddy is the only official in\r\nthe entire body that has the slightest power. In her Manual, she has\r\nprovided a prodigality of ways and forms whereby she can rid herself of\r\nany functionary in the government whenever she wants to. The officials\r\nare all shadows, save herself; she is the only reality. She allows no\r\none to hold office more than a year--no one gets a chance to become\r\nover-popular or over-useful, and dangerous. \u201cExcommunication\u201d is the\r\nfavorite penalty-it is threatened at every turn. It is evidently the pet\r\ndread and terror of the Church's membership.\r\n\r\nThe member who thinks, without getting his thought from Mrs. Eddy before\r\nuttering it, is banished permanently. One or two kinds of sinners can\r\nplead their way back into the fold, but this one, never. To think--in\r\nthe Supreme Church--is the New Unpardonable Sin.\r\n\r\nTo nearly every severe and fierce rule, Mrs. Eddy adds this rivet: \u201cThis\r\nBy-law shall not be changed without the consent of the Pastor Emeritus.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Eddy is the entire Supreme Church, in her own person, in the matter\r\nof powers and authorities.\r\n\r\nAlthough she has provided so many ways of getting rid of unsatisfactory\r\nmembers and officials, she was still afraid she might have left a\r\nlife-preserver lying around somewhere, therefore she devised a rule to\r\ncover that defect. By applying it, she can excommunicate (and this is\r\nperpetual again) every functionary connected with the Supreme Church,\r\nand every one of the twenty-five thousand members of that Church, at an\r\nhour's notice--and do it all by herself without anybody's help.\r\n\r\nBy authority of this astonishing By-law, she has only to say a\r\nperson connected with that Church is secretly practicing hypnotism or\r\nmesmerism; whereupon, immediate excommunication, without a hearing,\r\nis his portion! She does not have to order a trial and produce\r\nevidence--her accusation is all that is necessary.\r\n\r\nWhere is the Pope? and where the Czar? As the ballad says:\r\n\r\n     \u201cAsk of the winds that far away\r\n     With fragments strewed the sea!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Branch Church's pulpit is occupied by two \u201cReaders.\u201d Without them\r\nthe Branch Church is as dead as if its throat had been cut. To have\r\ncontrol, then, of the Readers, is to have control of the Branch\r\nChurches. Mrs. Eddy has that control--a control wholly without limit, a\r\ncontrol shared with no one.\r\n\r\n1. No Reader can be appointed to any Church in the Christian Science\r\nworld without her express approval.\r\n\r\n2. She can summarily expel from his or her place any Reader, at home or\r\nabroad, by a mere letter of dismissal, over her signature, and without\r\nfurnishing any reason for it, to either the congregation or the Reader.\r\n\r\nThus she has as absolute control over all Branch Churches as she has\r\nover the Supreme Church. This power exceeds the Pope's.\r\n\r\nIn simple truth, she is the only absolute sovereign in all Christendom.\r\nThe authority of the other sovereigns has limits, hers has none, none\r\nwhatever. And her yoke does not fret, does not offend. Many of the\r\nsubjects of the other monarchs feel their yoke, and are restive under\r\nit; their loyalty is insincere. It is not so with this one's human\r\nproperty; their loyalty is genuine, earnest, sincere, enthusiastic.\r\nThe sentiment which they feel for her is one which goes out in sheer\r\nperfection to no other occupant of a throne; for it is love, pure from\r\ndoubt, envy, exaction, fault-seeking, a love whose sun has no\r\nspot--that form of love, strong, great, uplifting, limitless, whose vast\r\nproportions are compassable by no word but one, the prodigious word,\r\nWorship. And it is not as a human being that her subjects worship her,\r\nbut as a supernatural one, a divine one, one who has comradeship with\r\nGod, and speaks by His voice.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eddy has herself created all these personal grandeurs and\r\nautocracies--with others which I have not (in this article) mentioned.\r\nThey place her upon an Alpine solitude and supremacy of power and\r\nspectacular show not hitherto attained by any other self-seeking\r\nenslaver disguised in the Christian name, and they persuade me that,\r\nalthough she may regard \u201cself-deification as blasphemous,\u201d she is as\r\nfond of it as I am of pie.\r\n\r\nShe knows about \u201cOur Mother's Room\u201d in the Supreme Church in\r\nBoston--above referred to--for she has been in it. In a recently\r\npublished North American Review article, I quoted a lady as saying Mrs.\r\nEddy's portrait could be seen there in a shrine, lit by always-burning\r\nlights, and that C.S. disciples came and worshiped it. That remark hurt\r\nthe feelings of more than one Scientist. They said it was not true, and\r\nasked me to correct it. I comply with pleasure. Whether the portrait was\r\nthere four years ago or not, it is not there now, for I have\r\ninquired. The only object in the shrine now, and lit by electrics--and\r\nworshiped--is an oil-portrait of the horse-hair chair Mrs. Eddy used\r\nto sit in when she was writing Science and Health! It seems to me that\r\nadulation has struck bottom, here.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eddy knows about that. She has been there, she has seen it, she has\r\nseen the worshippers. She could abolish that sarcasm with a word. She\r\nwithholds the word. Once more I seem to recognize in her exactly the\r\nsame appetite for self-deification that I have for pie. We seem to be\r\ncuriously alike; for the love of self-deification is really only the\r\nspiritual form of the material appetite for pie, and nothing could be\r\nmore strikingly Christian-Scientifically \u201charmonious.\u201d\r\n\r\nI note this phrase:\r\n\r\n\u201cChristian Science eschews divine rights in human beings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRights\u201d is vague; I do not know what it means there. Mrs. Eddy is not\r\nwell acquainted with the English language, and she is seldom able to say\r\nin it what she is trying to say. She has no ear for the exact word, and\r\ndoes not often get it. \u201cRights.\u201d Does it mean \u201chonors?\u201d \u201cattributes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEschews.\u201d This is another umbrella where there should be a torch; it\r\ndoes not illumine the sentence, it only deepens the shadows. Does she\r\nmean \u201cdenies?\u201d \u201crefuses?\u201d \u201cforbids?\u201d or something in that line? Does she\r\nmean:\r\n\r\n\u201cChristian Science denies divine honors to human beings?\u201d Or:\r\n\r\n\u201cChristian Science refuses to recognize divine attributes in human\r\nbeings?\u201d Or:\r\n\r\n\u201cChristian Science forbids the worship of human beings?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the succeeding sentence is to me a tunnel, but, when I\r\nemerge at this end of it, I seem to come into daylight. Then I seem to\r\nunderstand both sentences--with this result:\r\n\r\n\u201cChristian Science recognizes but one God, forbids the worship of human\r\nbeings, and refuses to recognize the possession of divine attributes by\r\nany member of the race.\u201d\r\n\r\nI am subject to correction, but I think that that is about what Mrs.\r\nEddy was intending to convey. Has her English--which is always difficult\r\nto me--beguiled me into misunderstanding the following remark, which she\r\nmakes (calling herself \u201cwe,\u201d after an old regal fashion of hers) in her\r\npreface to her Miscellaneous Writings?\r\n\r\n\u201cWhile we entertain decided views as to the best method for elevating\r\nthe race physically, morally, and spiritually, and shall express these\r\nviews as duty demands, we shall claim no especial gift from our divine\r\norgan, no supernatural power.\u201d\r\n\r\nWas she meaning to say:\r\n\r\n\u201cAlthough I am of divine origin and gifted with supernatural power, I\r\nshall not draw upon these resources in determining the best method of\r\nelevating the race?\u201d\r\n\r\nIf she had left out the word \u201cour,\u201d she might then seem to say:\r\n\r\n\u201cI claim no especial or unusual degree of divine origin--\u201d\r\n\r\nWhich is awkward--most awkward; for one either has a divine origin or\r\nhasn't; shares in it, degrees of it, are surely impossible. The idea of\r\ncrossed breeds in cattle is a thing we can entertain, for we are used to\r\nit, and it is possible; but the idea of a divine mongrel is unthinkable.\r\n\r\nWell, then, what does she mean? I am sure I do not know, for certain. It\r\nis the word \u201cour\u201d that makes all the trouble. With the \u201cour\u201d in, she is\r\nplainly saying \u201cmy divine origin.\u201d The word \u201cfrom\u201d seems to be intended\r\nto mean \u201con account of.\u201d It has to mean that or nothing, if \u201cour\u201d is\r\nallowed to stay. The clause then says:\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall claim no especial gift on account of my divine origin.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd I think that the full sentence was intended to mean what I have\r\nalready suggested:\r\n\r\n\u201cAlthough I am of divine origin, and gifted with supernatural power, I\r\nshall not draw upon these resources in determining the best method of\r\nelevating the race.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Eddy copyrighted that Preface seven years ago, she had long\r\nbeen used to regarding herself as a divine personage. I quote from Mr.\r\nF. W. Peabody's book:\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the Christian Science Journal for April, 1889, when it was her\r\nproperty, and published by her, it was claimed for her, and with her\r\nsanction, that she was equal with Jesus, and elaborate effort was made\r\nto establish the claim.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Eddy has distinctly authorized the claim in her behalf, that she\r\nherself was the chosen successor to and equal of Jesus.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe following remark in that April number, quoted by Mr. Peabody,\r\nindicates that her claim had been previously made, and had excited\r\n\u201chorror\u201d among some \u201cgood people\u201d:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, a word about the horror many good people have of our making the\r\nAuthor of Science and Health 'equal with Jesus.'\u201d\r\n\r\nSurely, if it had excited horror in Mrs. Eddy also, she would have\r\npublished a disclaimer. She owned the paper; she could say what she\r\npleased in its columns. Instead of rebuking her editor, she lets him\r\nrebuke those \u201cgood people\u201d for objecting to the claim.\r\n\r\nThese things seem to throw light upon those words, \u201cour [my] divine\r\norigin.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt may be that \u201cChristian Science eschews divine rights in human\r\nbeings,\u201d and forbids worship of any but \u201cone God, one Christ\u201d; but, if\r\nthat is the case, it looks as if Mrs. Eddy is a very unsound Christian\r\nScientist, and needs disciplining. I believe she has a serious\r\nmalady--\u201cself-deification\u201d; and that it will be well to have one of the\r\nexperts demonstrate over it.\r\n\r\nMeantime, let her go on living--for my sake. Closely examined,\r\npainstakingly studied, she is easily the most interesting person on the\r\nplanet, and, in several ways, as easily the most extraordinary woman\r\nthat was ever born upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S.--Since I wrote the foregoing, Mr. McCrackan's article appeared\r\n(in the March number of the North American Review). Before his article\r\nappeared--that is to say, during December, January, and February--I had\r\nwritten a new book, a character-portrait of Mrs. Eddy, drawn from her\r\nown acts and words, and it was then--together with the three brief\r\narticles previously published in the North American Review--ready to\r\nbe delivered to the printer for issue in book form. In that book, by\r\naccident and good luck, I have answered the objections made by Mr.\r\nMcCrackan to my views, and therefore do not need to add an answer here.\r\nAlso, in it I have corrected certain misstatements of mine which he has\r\nnoticed, and several others which he has not referred to. There are\r\none or two important matters of opinion upon which he and I are not\r\nin disagreement; but there are others upon which we must continue to\r\ndisagree, I suppose; indeed, I know we must; for instance, he believes\r\nMrs. Eddy wrote Science and Health, whereas I am quite sure I can\r\nconvince a person unhampered by predilections that she did not.\r\n\r\nAs concerns one considerable matter I hope to convert him. He believes\r\nMrs. Eddy's word; in his article he cites her as a witness, and takes\r\nher testimony at par; but if he will make an excursion through my book\r\nwhen it comes out, and will dispassionately examine her testimonies as\r\nthere accumulated, I think he will in candor concede that she is by a\r\nlarge percentage the most erratic and contradictory and untrustworthy\r\nwitness that has occupied the stand since the days of the lamented\r\nAnanias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, the hostiles reject and repudiate all the pretensions\r\nof Christian Science Christianity. They affirm that it has added nothing\r\nnew to Christianity; that it can do nothing that Christianity could not\r\ndo and was not doing before Christian Science was born.\r\n\r\nIn that case is there no field for the new Christianity, no opportunity\r\nfor usefulness, precious usefulness, great and distinguished usefulness?\r\nI think there is. I am far from being confident that it can fill it,\r\nbut I will indicate that unoccupied field--without charge--and if it can\r\nconquer it, it will deserve the praise and gratitude of the Christian\r\nworld, and will get it, I am sure.\r\n\r\nThe present Christianity makes an excellent private Christian, but its\r\nendeavors to make an excellent public one go for nothing, substantially.\r\n\r\nThis is an honest nation--in private life. The American Christian is a\r\nstraight and clean and honest man, and in his private commerce with his\r\nfellows can be trusted to stand faithfully by the principles of honor\r\nand honesty imposed upon him by his religion. But the moment he comes\r\nforward to exercise a public trust he can be confidently counted upon\r\nto betray that trust in nine cases out of ten, if \u201cparty loyalty\u201d shall\r\nrequire it.\r\n\r\nIf there are two tickets in the field in his city, one composed of\r\nhonest men and the other of notorious blatherskites and criminals, he\r\nwill not hesitate to lay his private Christian honor aside and vote for\r\nthe blatherskites if his \u201cparty honor\u201d shall exact it. His Christianity\r\nis of no use to him and has no influence upon him when he is acting in\r\na public capacity. He has sound and sturdy private morals, but he has no\r\npublic ones. In the last great municipal election in New York, almost\r\na complete one-half of the votes representing 3,500,000 Christians were\r\ncast for a ticket that had hardly a man on it whose earned and proper\r\nplace was outside of a jail. But that vote was present at church next\r\nSunday the same as ever, and as unconscious of its perfidy as if nothing\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\nOur Congresses consist of Christians. In their private life they are\r\ntrue to every obligation of honor; yet in every session they violate\r\nthem all, and do it without shame; because honor to party is above honor\r\nto themselves. It is an accepted law of public life that in it a man\r\nmay soil his honor in the interest of party expediency--must do it when\r\nparty expediency requires it. In private life those men would bitterly\r\nresent--and justly--any insinuation that it would not be safe to leave\r\nunwatched money within their reach; yet you could not wound their\r\nfeelings by reminding them that every time they vote ten dollars to the\r\npension appropriation nine of it is stolen money and they the marauders.\r\nThey have filched the money to take care of the party; they believe it\r\nwas right to do it; they do not see how their private honor is affected;\r\ntherefore their consciences are clear and at rest. By vote they do\r\nwrongful things every day, in the party interest, which they could not\r\nbe persuaded to do in private life. In the interest of party expediency\r\nthey give solemn pledges, they make solemn compacts; in the interest\r\nof party expediency they repudiate them without a blush. They would not\r\ndream of committing these strange crimes in private life.\r\n\r\nNow then, can Christian Science introduce the Congressional Blush? There\r\nare Christian Private Morals, but there are no Christian Public Morals,\r\nat the polls, or in Congress or anywhere else--except here and there\r\nand scattered around like lost comets in the solar system. Can Christian\r\nScience persuade the nation and Congress to throw away their public\r\nmorals and use none but their private ones henceforth in all their\r\nactivities, both public and private?\r\n\r\nI do not think so; but no matter about me: there is the field--a grand\r\none, a splendid one, a sublime one, and absolutely unoccupied. Has\r\nChristian Science confidence enough in itself to undertake to enter in\r\nand try to possess it?\r\n\r\nMake the effort, Christian Science; it is a most noble cause, and it\r\nmight succeed. It could succeed. Then we should have a new literature,\r\nwith romances entitled, How To Be an Honest Congressman Though a\r\nChristian; How To Be a Creditable Citizen Though a Christian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Christian Science, by Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens)\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CHRISTIAN SCIENCE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 3187-0.txt or 3187-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/3/1/8/3187/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Widger\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n",

There is the usual trouble in connecting up,\r\nminute voices in Folkestone and Dover and London call to one another and\r\nare submerged by buzzings and throbbings. Then in elfin tones the real\r\nmessage comes through: \"Bl\u00e9riot has crossed the Channel.... An article\r\n... about what it means.\"\r\n\r\nI make a hasty promise and go out and tell my friends.\r\n\r\nFrom my garden I look straight upon the Channel, and there are white\r\ncaps upon the water, and the iris and tamarisk are all asway with the\r\nsouth-west wind that was also blowing yesterday. M. Bl\u00e9riot has done\r\nvery well, and Mr. Latham, his rival, had jolly bad luck. That is what\r\nit means to us first of all. It also, I reflect privately, means that I\r\nhave under-estimated the possible stability of aeroplanes. I did not\r\nexpect anything of the sort so soon. This is a good five years before my\r\nreckoning of the year before last.\r\n\r\nWe all, I think, regret that being so near we were not among the\r\nfortunate ones who saw that little flat shape skim landward out of the\r\nblue; surely they have an enviable memory; and then we fell talking and\r\ndisputing about what that swift arrival may signify. It starts a swarm\r\nof questions.\r\n\r\nFirst one remarks that here is a thing done, and done with an\r\nastonishing effect of ease, that was incredible not simply to ignorant\r\npeople but to men well informed in these matters. It cannot be fifteen\r\nyears ago since Sir Hiram Maxim made the first machine that could lift\r\nits weight from the ground, and I well remember how the clumsy quality\r\nof that success confirmed the universal doubt that men could ever in any\r\neffectual manner fly.\r\n\r\nSince then a conspiracy of accidents has changed the whole problem; the\r\nbicycle and its vibrations developed the pneumatic tyre, the pneumatic\r\ntyre rendered a comfortable mechanically driven road vehicle possible,\r\nthe motor-car set an enormous premium on the development of very light,\r\nvery efficient engines, and at last the engineer was able to offer the\r\nexperimentalists in gliding one strong enough and light enough for the\r\nnew purpose. And here we are! Or, rather, M. Bl\u00e9riot is!\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean for us?\r\n\r\nOne meaning, I think, stands out plainly enough, unpalatable enough to\r\nour national pride. This thing from first to last was made abroad. Of\r\nall that made it possible we can only claim so much as is due to the\r\nimprovement of the bicycle. Gliding began abroad while our young men of\r\nmuscle and courage were braving the dangers of the cricket field. The\r\nmotor-car and its engine was being worked out \"over there,\" while in\r\nthis country the mechanically propelled road vehicle, lest it should\r\nfrighten the carriage horses of the gentry, was going meticulously at\r\nfour miles an hour behind a man with a red flag. Over there, where the\r\nprosperous classes have some regard for education and some freedom of\r\nimaginative play, where people discuss all sorts of things fearlessly,\r\nand have a respect for science, this has been achieved.\r\n\r\nAnd now our insularity is breached by the foreigner who has got ahead\r\nwith flying.\r\n\r\nIt means, I take it, first and foremost for us, that the world cannot\r\nwait for the English.\r\n\r\nIt is not the first warning we have had. It has been raining warnings\r\nupon us; never was a slacking, dull people so liberally served with\r\nwarnings of what was in store for them. But this event--this\r\nforeigner-invented, foreigner-built, foreigner-steered thing, taking our\r\nsilver streak as a bird soars across a rivulet--puts the case\r\ndramatically. We have fallen behind in the quality of our manhood. In\r\nthe men of means and leisure in this island there was neither enterprise\r\nenough, imagination enough, knowledge nor skill enough to lead in this\r\nmatter. I do not see how one can go into the history of this development\r\nand arrive at any other conclusion. The French and Americans can laugh\r\nat our aeroplanes, the Germans are ten years ahead of our poor\r\nnavigables. We are displayed a soft, rather backward people. Either we\r\nare a people essentially and incurably inferior, or there is something\r\nwrong in our training, something benumbing in our atmosphere and\r\ncircumstances. That is the first and gravest intimation in M. Bl\u00e9riot's\r\nfeat.\r\n\r\nThe second is that, in spite of our fleet, this is no longer, from the\r\nmilitary point of view, an inaccessible island.\r\n\r\nSo long as one had to consider the navigable balloon the aerial side of\r\nwarfare remained unimportant. A Zeppelin is little good for any purpose\r\nbut scouting and espionage. It can carry very little weight in\r\nproportion to its vast size, and, what is more important, it cannot drop\r\nthings without sending itself up like a bubble in soda water. An armada\r\nof navigables sent against this island would end in a dispersed,\r\ndeflated state, chiefly in the seas between Orkney and Norway--though I\r\nsay it who should not. But these aeroplanes can fly all round the\r\nfastest navigable that ever drove before the wind; they can drop\r\nweights, take up weights, and do all sorts of able, inconvenient things.\r\nThey are birds. As for the birds, so for aeroplanes; there is an upward\r\nlimit of size. They are not going to be very big, but they are going to\r\nbe very able and active. Within a year we shall have--or rather _they_\r\nwill have--aeroplanes capable of starting from Calais, let us say,\r\ncircling over London, dropping a hundredweight or so of explosive upon\r\nthe printing machines of _The Times_, and returning securely to Calais\r\nfor another similar parcel. They are things neither difficult nor costly\r\nto make. For the price of a Dreadnought one might have hundreds. They\r\nwill be extremely hard to hit with any sort of missile. I do not think a\r\nlarge army of under-educated, under-trained, extremely unwilling\r\nconscripts is going to be any good against this sort of thing.\r\n\r\nI do not think that the arrival of M. Bl\u00e9riot means a panic resort to\r\nconscription. It is extremely desirable that people should realise that\r\nthese foreign machines are not a temporary and incidental advantage that\r\nwe can make good by fussing and demanding eight, and saying we won't\r\nwait, and so on, and then subsiding into indolence again. They are just\r\nthe first-fruits of a steady, enduring lead that the foreigner has won.\r\nThe foreigner is ahead of us in education, and this is especially true\r\nof the middle and upper classes, from which invention and enterprise\r\ncome--or, in our own case, do not come. He makes a better class of man\r\nthan we do. His science is better than ours. His training is better than\r\nours. His imagination is livelier. His mind is more active. His\r\nrequirements in a novel, for example, are not kindly, sedative pap; his\r\nuncensored plays deal with reality. His schools are places for vigorous\r\neducation instead of genteel athleticism, and his home has books in it,\r\nand thought and conversation. Our homes and schools are relatively dull\r\nand uninspiring; there is no intellectual guide or stir in them; and to\r\nthat we owe this new generation of nicely behaved, unenterprising sons,\r\nwho play golf and dominate the tailoring of the world, while Brazilians,\r\nFrenchmen, Americans and Germans fly.\r\n\r\nThat we are hopelessly behindhand in aeronautics is not a fact by\r\nitself. It is merely an indication that we are behindhand in our\r\nmechanical knowledge and invention M. Bl\u00e9riot's aeroplane points also to\r\nthe fleet.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for naval supremacy is not merely a struggle in\r\nshipbuilding and expenditure. Much more is it a struggle in knowledge\r\nand invention. It is not the Power that has the most ships or the\r\nbiggest ships that is going to win in a naval conflict. It is the Power\r\nthat thinks quickest of what to do, is most resourceful and inventive.\r\nEighty Dreadnoughts manned by dull men are only eighty targets for a\r\nquicker adversary. Well, is there any reason to suppose that our Navy\r\nis going to keep above the general national level in these things? Is\r\nthe Navy _bright_?\r\n\r\nThe arrival of M. Bl\u00e9riot suggests most horribly to me how far behind we\r\nmust be in all matters of ingenuity, device, and mechanical contrivance.\r\nI am reminded again of the days during the Boer war, when one realised\r\nthat it had never occurred to our happy-go-lucky Army that it was\r\npossible to make a military use of barbed wire or construct a trench to\r\ndefy shrapnel. Suppose in the North Sea we got a surprise like that, and\r\nfished out a parboiled, half-drowned admiral explaining what a\r\nconfoundedly slim, unexpected, almost ungentlemanly thing the enemy had\r\ndone to him.\r\n\r\nVery probably the Navy is the exception to the British system; its\r\nofficers are rescued from the dull homes and dull schools of their class\r\nwhile still of tender years, and shaped after a fashion of their own.\r\nBut M. Bl\u00e9riot reminds us that we may no longer shelter and degenerate\r\nbehind these blue backs. And the keenest men at sea are none the worse\r\nfor having keen men on land behind them.\r\n\r\nAre we an awakening people?\r\n\r\nIt is the vital riddle of our time. I look out upon the windy Channel\r\nand think of all those millions just over there, who seem to get busier\r\nand keener every hour. I could imagine the day of reckoning coming like\r\na swarm of birds.\r\n\r\nHere the air is full of the clamour of rich and prosperous people\r\ninvited to pay taxes, and beyond measure bitter. They are going to live\r\nabroad, cut their charities, dismiss old servants, and do all sorts of\r\nsilly, vindictive things. We seem to be doing feeble next-to-nothings\r\nin the endowment of research. Not one in twenty of the boys of the\r\nmiddle and upper classes learns German or gets more than a misleading\r\nsmattering of physical science. Most of them never learn to speak\r\nFrench. Heaven alone knows what they do with their brains! The British\r\nreading and thinking public probably does not number fifty thousand\r\npeople all told. It is difficult to see whence the necessary impetus for\r\na national renascence is to come.... The universities are poor and\r\nspiritless, with no ambition to lead the country. I met a Boy Scout\r\nrecently. He was hopeful in his way, but a little inadequate, I thought,\r\nas a basis for confidence in the future of the Empire.\r\n\r\nWe have still our Derby Day, of course....\r\n\r\nApart from these patriotic solicitudes, M. Bl\u00e9riot has set quite another\r\ntrain of thought going in my mind. The age of natural democracy is\r\nsurely at an end through these machines. There comes a time when men\r\nwill be sorted out into those who will have the knowledge, nerve, and\r\ncourage to do these splendid, dangerous things, and those who will\r\nprefer the humbler level. I do not think numbers are going to matter so\r\nmuch in the warfare of the future, and that when organised intelligence\r\ndiffers from the majority, the majority will have no adequate power of\r\nretort. The common man with a pike, being only sufficiently indignant\r\nand abundant, could chase the eighteenth century gentleman as he chose,\r\nbut I fail to see what he can do in the way of mischief to an elusive\r\nchevalier with wings. But that opens too wide a discussion for me to\r\nenter upon now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FIRST FLIGHT\r\n\r\n(EASTBOURNE, _August 5, 1912--three years later_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto my only flights have been flights of imagination but this\r\nmorning I flew. I spent about ten or fifteen minutes in the air; we went\r\nout to sea, soared up, came back over the land, circled higher, planed\r\nsteeply down to the water, and I landed with the conviction that I had\r\nhad only the foretaste of a great store of hitherto unsuspected\r\npleasures. At the first chance I will go up again, and I will go higher\r\nand further.\r\n\r\nThis experience has restored all the keenness of my ancient interest in\r\nflying, which had become a little fagged and flat by too much hearing\r\nand reading about the thing and not enough participation. Sixteen years\r\nago, in the days of Langley and Lilienthal, I was one of the few\r\njournalists who believed and wrote that flying was possible; it affected\r\nmy reputation unfavourably, and produced in the few discouraged pioneers\r\nof those days a quite touching gratitude. Over my mantel as I write\r\nhangs a very blurred and bad but interesting photograph that Professor\r\nLangley sent me sixteen years ago. It shows the flight of the first\r\npiece of human machinery heavier than air that ever kept itself up for\r\nany length of time. It was a model, a little affair that would not have\r\nlifted a cat; it went up in a spiral and came down unsmashed, bringing\r\nback, like Noah's dove, the promise of tremendous things.\r\n\r\nThat was only sixteen years ago, and it is amusing to recall how\r\ncautiously even we out-and-out believers did our prophesying. I was\r\nquite a desperate fellow; I said outright that in my lifetime we should\r\nsee men flying. But I qualified that by repeating that for many years to\r\ncome it would be an enterprise only for quite fantastic daring and\r\nskill. We conjured up stupendous difficulties and risks. I was deeply\r\nimpressed and greatly discouraged by a paper a distinguished Cambridge\r\nmathematician produced to show that a flying machine was bound to pitch\r\nfearfully, that as it flew on its pitching _must_ increase until up went\r\nits nose, down went its tail, and it fell like a knife. We exaggerated\r\nevery possibility of instability. We imagined that when the aeroplane\r\nwasn't \"kicking up ahind and afore\" it would be heeling over to the\r\nlightest side wind. A sneeze might upset it. We contrasted our poor\r\nhuman equipment with the instinctive balance of a bird, which has had\r\nten million years of evolution by way of a start....\r\n\r\nThe waterplane in which I soared over Eastbourne this morning with Mr.\r\nGrahame-White was as steady as a motor-car running on asphalt.\r\n\r\nThen we went on from those anticipations of swaying insecurity to\r\nspeculations about the psychological and physiological effects of\r\nflying. Most people who look down from the top of a cliff or high tower\r\nfeel some slight qualms of dread, many feel a quite sickening dread.\r\nEven if men struggled high into the air, we asked, wouldn't they be\r\nsmitten up there by such a lonely and reeling dismay as to lose all\r\nself-control? And, above all, wouldn't the pitching and tossing make\r\nthem quite horribly sea-sick?\r\n\r\nI have always been a little haunted by that last dread. It gave a little\r\nundertow of funk to the mood of lively curiosity with which I got\r\naboard the waterplane this morning--that sort of faint, thin funk that\r\nso readily invades one on the verge of any new experience; when one\r\ntries one's first dive, for example, or pushes off for the first time\r\ndown an ice run. I thought I should very probably be sea-sick--or, to be\r\nmore precise, air-sick; I thought also that I might be very giddy, and\r\nthat I might get thoroughly cold and uncomfortable None of those things\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nI am still in a state of amazement at the smooth steadfastness of the\r\nmotion. There is nothing on earth to compare with that, unless--and that\r\nI can't judge--it is an ice yacht travelling on perfect ice. The finest\r\nmotor-car in the world on the best road would be a joggling, quivering\r\nthing beside it.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, we went out to sea before the wind, and the plane would\r\nnot readily rise. We went with an undulating movement, leaping with a\r\nlight splashing pat upon the water, from wave to wave. Then we came\r\nabout into the wind and rose, and looking over I saw that there were no\r\nlonger those periodic flashes of white foam. I was flying. And it was as\r\nstill and steady as dreaming. I watched the widening distance between\r\nour floats and the waves. It wasn't by any means a windless day; there\r\nwas a brisk, fluctuating breeze blowing out of the north over the downs.\r\nIt seemed hardly to affect our flight at all.\r\n\r\nAnd as for the giddiness of looking down, one does not feel it at all.\r\nIt is difficult to explain why this should be so, but it is so. I\r\nsuppose in such matters I am neither exceptionally steady-headed nor is\r\nmy head exceptionally given to swimming. I can stand on the edge of\r\ncliffs of a thousand feet or so and look down, but I can never bring\r\nmyself right up to the edge nor crane over to look to the very bottom. I\r\nshould want to lie down to do that. And the other day I was on that\r\nBelvedere place at the top of the Rotterdam sky-scraper, a rather high\r\nwind was blowing, and one looks down through the chinks between the\r\nboards one stands on upon the heads of the people in the streets below;\r\nI didn't like it. But this morning I looked directly down on a little\r\nfleet of fishing boats over which we passed, and on the crowds\r\nassembling on the beach, and on the bathers who stared up at us from the\r\nbreaking surf, with an entirely agreeable exaltation. And Eastbourne, in\r\nthe early morning sunshine, had all the brightly detailed littleness of\r\na town viewed from high up on the side of a great mountain.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Grahame-White told me we were going to plane down I will\r\nconfess I tightened my hold on the sides of the car and prepared for\r\nsomething like the down-going sensation of a switchback railway on a\r\nlarger scale. Just for a moment there was that familiar feeling of\r\nsomething pressing one's heart up towards one's shoulders, and one's\r\nlower jaw up into its socket and of grinding one's lower teeth against\r\nthe upper, and then it passed. The nose of the car and all the machine\r\nwas slanting downwards, we were gliding quickly down, and yet there was\r\nno feeling that one rushed, not even as one rushes in coasting a hill on\r\na bicycle. It wasn't a tithe of the thrill of those three descents one\r\ngets on the great mountain railway in the White City. There one gets a\r\ndisagreeable quiver up one's backbone from the wheels, and a real sense\r\nof falling.\r\n\r\nIt is quite peculiar to flying that one is incredulous of any\r\ncollision. Some time ago I was in a motor-car that ran over and killed a\r\nsmall dog, and this wretched little incident has left an open wound upon\r\nmy nerves. I am never quite happy in a car now; I can't help keeping an\r\napprehensive eye ahead. But you fly with an exhilarating assurance that\r\nyou cannot possibly run over anything or run into anything--except the\r\nland or the sea, and even those large essentials seem a beautifully safe\r\ndistance away.\r\n\r\nI had heard a great deal of talk about the deafening uproar of the\r\nengine. I counted a headache among my chances. There again reason\r\nreinforced conjecture. When in the early morning Mr. Travers came from\r\nBrighton in this Farman in which I flew I could hear the hum of the\r\ngreat insect when it still seemed abreast of Beachy Head, and a good two\r\nmiles away. If one can hear a thing at two miles, how much the more will\r\none not hear it at a distance of two yards? But at the risk of seeming\r\ntoo contented for anything I will assert I heard that noise no more than\r\none hears the drone of an electric ventilator upon one's table. It was\r\nonly when I came to speak to Mr. Grahame-White, or he to me, that I\r\ndiscovered that our voices had become almost infinitesimally small.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was I went up into the air at Eastbourne with the impression\r\nthat flying was still an uncomfortable experimental, and slightly heroic\r\nthing to do, and came down to the cheerful gathering crowd upon the\r\nsands again with the knowledge that it is a thing achieved for everyone.\r\nIt will get much cheaper, no doubt, and much swifter, and be improved in\r\na dozen ways--we _must_ get self-starting engines, for example, for both\r\nour aeroplanes and motor-cars--but it is available to-day for anyone\r\nwho can reach it. An invalid lady of seventy could have enjoyed all that\r\nI did if only one could have got her into the passenger's seat. Getting\r\nthere was a little difficult, it is true; the waterplane was out in the\r\nsurf, and I was carried to it on a boatman's back, and then had to\r\nclamber carefully through the wires, but that is a matter of detail.\r\nThis flying is indeed so certain to become a general experience that I\r\nam sure that this description will in a few years seem almost as quaint\r\nas if I had set myself to record the fears and sensations of my First\r\nRide in a Wheeled Vehicle. And I suspect that learning to control a\r\nFarman waterplane now is probably not much more difficult than, let us\r\nsay, twice the difficulty in learning the control and management of a\r\nmotor-bicycle. I cannot understand the sort of young man who won't learn\r\nhow to do it if he gets half a chance.\r\n\r\nThe development of these waterplanes is an important step towards the\r\nhuge and swarming popularisation of flying which is now certainly\r\nimminent. We ancient survivors of those who believed in and wrote about\r\nflying before there was any flying used to make a great fuss about the\r\ndangers and difficulties of landing and getting up. We wrote with vast\r\ngravity about \"starting rails\" and \"landing stages,\" and it is still\r\ntrue that landing an aeroplane, except upon a well-known and quite level\r\nexpanse, is a risky and uncomfortable business. But getting up and\r\nlanding upon fairly smooth water is easier than getting into bed. This\r\nalone is likely to determine the aeroplane routes along the line of the\r\nworld's coastlines and lake groups and waterways. The airmen will go to\r\nand fro over water as the midges do. Wherever there is a square mile of\r\nwater the waterplanes will come and go like hornets at the mouth of\r\ntheir nest. But there are much stronger reasons than this convenience\r\nfor keeping over water. Over water the air, it seems, lies in great\r\nlevel expanses; even when there are gales it moves in uniform masses\r\nlike the swift, still rush of a deep river. The airman, in Mr.\r\nGrahame-White's phrase, can go to sleep on it. But over the land, and\r\nfor thousands of feet up into the sky, the air is more irregular than a\r\ntorrent among rocks; it is--if only we could see it--a waving, whirling,\r\neddying, flamboyant confusion. A slight hill, a ploughed field, the\r\nstreets of a town, create riotous, rolling, invisible streams and\r\ncataracts of air that catch the airman unawares, make him drop\r\ndisconcertingly, try his nerves. With a powerful enough engine he climbs\r\nat once again, but these sudden downfalls are the least pleasant and\r\nmost dangerous experience in aviation. They exact a tiring vigilance.\r\n\r\nOver lake or sea, in sunshine, within sight of land, this is the perfect\r\nway of the flying tourist. Gladly would I have set out for France this\r\nmorning instead of returning to Eastbourne. And then coasted round to\r\nSpain and into the Mediterranean. And so by leisurely stages to India.\r\nAnd the East Indies....\r\n\r\nI find my study unattractive to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOFF THE CHAIN\r\n\r\n(_December, 1910_)\r\n\r\n\r\nI was ill in bed, reading Samuel Warren's \"Ten Thousand a Year,\" and\r\nnoting how much the world can change in seventy years.\r\n\r\nI had just got to the journey of Titmouse from London to Yorkshire in\r\nthat ex-sheriff's coach he bought in Long Acre--where now the motor-cars\r\nare sold--when there came a telegram to bid me note how a certain Mr.\r\nHolt was upon the ocean, coming back to England from a little excursion.\r\nHe had left London last Saturday week at midday; he hoped to be back by\r\nThursday; and he had talked to the President in Washington, visited\r\nPhiladelphia, and had a comparatively loitering afternoon in New York.\r\nWhat had I to say about it?\r\n\r\nFirstly, that I wish this article could be written by Samuel Warren. And\r\nfailing that, I wish that Charles Dickens, who wrote in his \"American\r\nNotes\" with such passionate disgust and hostility about the first\r\nCunarder, retailing all the discomfort and misery of crossing the\r\nAtlantic by steamship, could have shared Mr. Holt's experience.\r\n\r\nBecause I am chiefly impressed by the fact not that Mr. Holt has taken\r\ndays where weeks were needed fifty years ago, but that he has done it\r\nvery comfortably, without undue physical exertion, and at no greater\r\nexpense, I suppose, than it cost Dickens, whom the journey nearly\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Holt's expenses were higher, it was for the special trains and\r\nthe sake of the record. Anyone taking ordinary trains and ordinary\r\npassages may do what he has done in eighteen or twenty days.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy, \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" was still a\r\nbrilliant piece of imaginative fiction. Now that is almost an invalid's\r\npace. It will not be very long before a man will be able to go round the\r\nworld if he wishes to do so ten times in a year. And it is perhaps\r\nforgivable if those who, like Jules Verne, saw all these increments in\r\nspeed, motor-cars, and airships aeroplanes, and submarines, wireless\r\ntelegraphy and what not, as plain and necessary deductions from the\r\npromises of physical science, should turn upon a world that read and\r\ndoubted and jeered with \"I told you so. _Now_ will you respect a\r\nprophet?\"\r\n\r\nIt was not that the prophets professed any mystical and inexplicable\r\nillumination at which a sceptic might reasonably mock; they were\r\nprepared with ample reasons for the things they foretold. Now, quite as\r\nconfidently, they point on to a new series of consequences, high\r\nprobabilities that follow on all this tremendous development of swift,\r\nsecure, and cheapened locomotion, just as they followed almost\r\nnecessarily upon the mechanical developments of the last century.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the ties that bind men to place are being severed; we are in\r\nthe beginning of a new phase in human experience.\r\n\r\nFor endless ages man led the hunting life, migrating after his food,\r\ncamping, homeless, as to this day are many of the Indians and Esquimaux\r\nin the Hudson Bay Territory. Then began agriculture, and for the sake of\r\nsecurer food man tethered himself to a place. The history of man's\r\nprogress from savagery to civilisation is essentially a story of\r\nsettling down. It begins in caves and shelters; it culminates in a wide\r\nspectacle of farms and peasant villages, and little towns among the\r\nfarms. There were wars, crusades, barbarous invasions, set-backs, but to\r\nthat state all Asia, Europe, North Africa worked its way with an\r\nindomitable pertinacity. The enormous majority of human beings stayed at\r\nhome at last; from the cradle to the grave they lived, married, died in\r\nthe same district, usually in the same village; and to that condition,\r\nlaw, custom, habits, morals, have adapted themselves. The whole plan and\r\nconception of human society is based on the rustic home and the needs\r\nand characteristics of the agricultural family. There have been gipsies,\r\nwanderers, knaves, knights-errant and adventurers, no doubt, but the\r\nsettled permanent rustic home and the tenure of land about it, and the\r\nhens and the cow, have constituted the fundamental reality of the whole\r\nscene. Now, the really wonderful thing in this astonishing development\r\nof cheap, abundant, swift locomotion we have seen in the last seventy\r\nyears--in the development of which Mauretanias, aeroplanes,\r\nmile-a-minute expresses, tubes, motor-buses and motor cars are just the\r\nbright, remarkable points--is this: that it dissolves almost all the\r\nreason and necessity why men should go on living permanently in any one\r\nplace or rigidly disciplined to one set of conditions. The former\r\nattachment to the soil ceases to be an advantage. The human spirit has\r\nnever quite subdued itself to the laborious and established life; it\r\nachieves its best with variety and occasional vigorous exertion under\r\nthe stimulus of novelty rather than by constant toil, and this\r\nrevolution in human locomotion that brings nearly all the globe within\r\na few days of any man is the most striking aspect of the unfettering\r\nagain of the old restless, wandering, adventurous tendencies in man's\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nAlready one can note remarkable developments of migration. There is, for\r\nexample, that flow to and fro across the Atlantic of labourers from the\r\nMediterranean. Italian workmen by the hundred thousand go to the United\r\nStates in the spring and return in the autumn. Again, there is a stream\r\nof thousands of prosperous Americans to summer in Europe. Compared with\r\nany European country, the whole population of the United States is\r\nfluid. Equally notable is the enormous proportion of the British\r\nprosperous which winters either in the high Alps or along the Riviera.\r\nEngland is rapidly developing the former Irish grievance of an absentee\r\npropertied class. It is only now by the most strenuous artificial\r\nbanking back that migrations on a far huger scale from India into\r\nAfrica, and from China and Japan into Australia and America are\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nAll the indications point to a time when it will be an altogether\r\nexceptional thing for a man to follow one occupation in one place all\r\nhis life, and still rarer for a son to follow in his father's footsteps\r\nor die in his father's house.\r\n\r\nThe thing is as simple as the rule of three. We are off the chain of\r\nlocality for good and all. It was necessary heretofore for a man to live\r\nin immediate contact with his occupation, because the only way for him\r\nto reach it was to have it at his door, and the cost and delay of\r\ntransport were relatively too enormous for him to shift once he was\r\nsettled. _Now_ he may live twenty or thirty miles away from his\r\noccupation; and it often pays him to spend the small amount of time and\r\nmoney needed to move--it may be half-way round the world--to healthier\r\nconditions or more profitable employment.\r\n\r\nAnd with every diminution in the cost and duration of transport it\r\nbecomes more and more possible, and more and more likely, to be\r\nprofitable to move great multitudes of workers seasonally between\r\nregions where work is needed in this season and regions where work is\r\nneeded in that. They can go out to the agricultural lands at one time\r\nand come back into towns for artistic work and organised work in\r\nfactories at another. They can move from rain and darkness into\r\nsunshine, and from heat into the coolness of mountain forests. Children\r\ncan be sent for education to sea beaches and healthy mountains.\r\n\r\nMen will harvest in Saskatchewan and come down in great liners to spend\r\nthe winter working in the forests of Yucatan.\r\n\r\nPeople have hardly begun to speculate about the consequences of the\r\nreturn of humanity from a closely tethered to a migratory existence. It\r\nis here that the prophet finds his chief opportunity. Obviously, these\r\ngreat forces of transport are already straining against the limits of\r\nexisting political areas. Every country contains now an increasing\r\ningredient of unenfranchised Uitlanders. Every country finds a growing\r\nsection of its home-born people either living largely abroad, drawing\r\nthe bulk of their income from the exterior, and having their essential\r\ninterests wholly or partially across the frontier.\r\n\r\nIn every locality of a Western European country countless people are\r\nfound delocalised, uninterested in the affairs of that particular\r\nlocality, and capable of moving themselves with a minimum of loss and a\r\nmaximum of facility into any other region that proves more attractive.\r\nIn America political life, especially State life as distinguished from\r\nnational political life, is degraded because of the natural and\r\ninevitable apathy of a large portion of the population whose interests\r\ngo beyond the State.\r\n\r\nPoliticians and statesmen, being the last people in the world to notice\r\nwhat is going on in it, are making no attempt whatever to re-adapt this\r\nhugely growing floating population of delocalised people to the public\r\nservice. As Mr. Marriott puts it in his novel, \"_Now,\"_ they \"drop out\"\r\nfrom politics as we understand politics at present. Local administration\r\nfalls almost entirely--and the decision of Imperial affairs tends more\r\nand more to fall--into the hands of that dwindling and adventurous\r\nmoiety which sits tight in one place from the cradle to the grave. No\r\none has yet invented any method for the political expression and\r\ncollective direction of a migratory population, and nobody is attempting\r\nto do so. It is a new problem....\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a curious prospect, the prospect of a new kind of people,\r\na floating population going about the world, uprooted, delocalised, and\r\neven, it may be, denationalised, with wide interests and wide views,\r\ndeveloping no doubt, customs and habits of its own, a morality of its\r\nown, a philosophy of its own, and yet from the point of view of current\r\npolitics and legislation unorganised and ineffective.\r\n\r\nMost of the forces of international finance and international business\r\nenterprise will be with it. It will develop its own characteristic\r\nstandards of art and literature and conduct in accordance with its new\r\nnecessities. It is, I believe, the mankind of the future. And the last\r\nthing it will be able to do will be to legislate. The history of the\r\nimmediate future will, I am convinced, be very largely the history of\r\nthe conflict of the needs of this new population with the institutions,\r\nthe boundaries the laws, prejudices, and deep-rooted traditions\r\nestablished during the home-keeping, localised era of mankind's career.\r\n\r\nThis conflict follows as inevitably upon these new gigantic facilities\r\nof locomotion as the _Mauretania_ followed from the discoveries of steam\r\nand steel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE NEW REIGN\r\n\r\n(_June, 1911_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bunting and the crimson vanish from the streets. Already the vast\r\narmy of improvised carpenters that the Coronation has created set\r\nthemselves to the work of demolition, and soon every road that converges\r\nupon Central London will be choked again with great loads of timber--but\r\nthis time going outward--as our capital emerges from this unprecedented\r\ninundation of loyalty. The most elaborately conceived, the most stately\r\nof all recorded British Coronations is past.\r\n\r\nWhat new phase in the life of our nation and our Empire does this\r\ntremendous ceremony inaugurate? The question is inevitable. There is\r\nnothing in all the social existence of men so full of challenge as the\r\ncrowning of a king. It is the end of the overture; the curtain rises.\r\nThis is a new beginning-place for histories.\r\n\r\nTo us, the great mass of common Englishmen, who have no place in the\r\nhierarchy of our land, who do not attend Courts nor encounter uniforms,\r\nwhose function is at most spectacular, who stand in the street and watch\r\nthe dignitaries and the liveries pass by, this sense of critical\r\nexpectation is perhaps greater than it is for those more immediately\r\nconcerned in the spectacle. They have had their parts to play, their\r\nsymbolic acts to perform, they have sat in their privileged places, and\r\nwe have waited at the barriers until their comfort and dignity was\r\nassured. I can conceive many of them, a little fatigued, preparing now\r\nfor social dispersal, relaxing comfortably into gossip, discussing the\r\ndetail of these events with an air of things accomplished. They will\r\ndecide whether the Coronation has been a success and whether everything\r\nhas or has not passed off very well. For us in the great crowd nothing\r\nhas as yet succeeded or passed off well or ill. We are intent upon a\r\nKing newly anointed and crowned, a King of whom we know as yet very\r\nlittle, but who has, nevertheless, roused such expectation as no King\r\nbefore him has done since Tudor times, in the presence of gigantic\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\nThere is a conviction widespread among us--his own words, perhaps, have\r\ndone most to create it--that King George is inspired, as no recent\r\npredecessor has been inspired, by the conception of kingship, that his\r\nis to be no r\u00f4le of almost indifferent abstinence from the broad\r\nprocesses of our national and imperial development. That greater public\r\nlife which is above party and above creed and sect has, we are told,\r\ntaken hold of his imagination; he is to be no crowned image of unity and\r\ncorrelation, a layer of foundation-stones and a signature to documents,\r\nbut an actor in our drama, a living Prince.\r\n\r\nTime will test these hopes, but certainly we, the innumerable democracy\r\nof individually unimportant men, have felt the need for such a Prince.\r\nOur consciousness of defects, of fields of effort untilled, of vast\r\npossibilities neglected and slipping away from us for ever, has never\r\nreally slumbered again since the chastening experiences of the Boer War.\r\nSince then the national spirit, hampered though it is by the traditions\r\nof party government and a legacy of intellectual and social heaviness,\r\nhas been in uneasy and ineffectual revolt against deadness, against\r\nstupidity and slackness, against waste and hypocrisy in every department\r\nof life. We have come to see more and more clearly how little we can\r\nhope for from politicians, societies and organised movements in these\r\nessential things. It is this that has invested the energy and manhood,\r\nthe untried possibilities of the new King with so radiant a light of\r\nhope for us.\r\n\r\nThink what it may mean for us all--I write as one of that great\r\nill-informed multitude, sincerely and gravely patriotic, outside the\r\nechoes of Court gossip and the easy knowledge of exalted society--if our\r\nKing does indeed care for these wider and profounder things! Suppose we\r\nhave a King at last who cares for the advancement of science, who is\r\nwilling to do the hundred things that are so easy in his position to\r\nincrease research, to honour and to share in scientific thought. Suppose\r\nwe have a King whose head rises above the level of the Court artist, and\r\nwho not only can but will appeal to the latent and discouraged power of\r\nartistic creation in our race. Suppose we have a King who understands\r\nthe need for incessant, acute criticism to keep our collective\r\nactivities intelligent and efficient, and for a flow of bold, unhampered\r\nthought through every department of the national life, a King liberal\r\nwithout laxity and patriotic without pettiness or vulgarity. Such, it\r\nseems to us who wait at present almost inexpressively outside the\r\nimmediate clamours of a mere artificial loyalty, are the splendid\r\npossibilities of the time.\r\n\r\nFor England is no exhausted or decaying country. It is rich with an\r\nunmeasured capacity for generous responses. It is a country burthened\r\nindeed, but not overwhelmed, by the gigantic responsibilities of\r\nEmpire, a little relaxed by wealth, and hampered rather than enslaved by\r\na certain shyness of temperament, a certain habitual timidity,\r\nslovenliness and insincerity of mind. It is a little distrustful of\r\nintellectual power and enterprise, a little awkward and ungracious to\r\nbrave and beautiful things, a little too tolerant of dull, well-meaning\r\nand industrious men and arrogant old women. It suffers hypocrites\r\ngladly, because its criticism is poor, and it is wastefully harsh to\r\nfrank unorthodoxy. But its heart is sound if its judgments fall short of\r\nacuteness and if its standards of achievement are low. It needs but a\r\nquickening spirit upon the throne, always the traditional centre of its\r\nrespect, to rise from even the appearance of decadence. There is a new\r\nquality seeking expression in England like the rising of sap in the\r\nspring, a new generation asking only for such leadership and such\r\nemancipation from restricted scope and ungenerous hostility as a King\r\nalone can give it....\r\n\r\nWhen in its turn this latest reign comes at last to its reckoning, what\r\nwill the sum of its achievement be? What will it leave of things\r\nvisible? Will it leave a London preserved and beautified, or will it but\r\nadd abundantly to the lumps of dishonest statuary, the scars and masses\r\nof ill-conceived rebuilding which testify to the aesthetic degradation\r\nof the Victorian period? Will a great constellation of artists redeem\r\nthe ambitious sentimentalities and genteel skilfulness that find their\r\nfitting mausoleum in the Tate Gallery? Will our literature escape at\r\nlast from pretentiousness and timidity, our philosophy from the foolish\r\ncerebrations of university \"characters\" and eminent politicians at\r\nleisure, and our starved science find scope and resources adequate to\r\nits gigantic needs? Will our universities, our teaching, our national\r\ntraining, our public services, gain a new health from the reviving\r\nvigour of the national brain? Or is all this a mere wild hope, and shall\r\nwe, after perhaps some small flutterings of effort, the foundation of\r\nsome ridiculous little academy of literary busybodies and hangers-on,\r\nthe public recognition of this or that sociological pretender or\r\nfinancial \"scientist,\" and a little polite jobbery with picture-buying,\r\nrelapse into lassitude and a contented acquiescence in the rivalry of\r\nGermany and the United States for the moral, intellectual and material\r\nleadership of the world?\r\n\r\nThe deaths and accessions of Kings, the changing of names and coins and\r\nsymbols and persons, a little force our minds in the marking off of\r\nepochs. We are brought to weigh one generation against another, to\r\nreckon up our position and note the characteristics of a new phase. What\r\nlies before us in the next decades? Is England going on to fresh\r\nachievements, to a renewed and increased predominance, or is she falling\r\ninto a secondary position among the peoples of the world?\r\n\r\nThe answer to that depends upon ourselves. Have we pride enough to\r\nattempt still to lead mankind, and if we have, have we the wisdom and\r\nthe quality? Or are we just the children of Good Luck, who are being\r\nfound out?\r\n\r\nSome years ago our present King exhorted this island to \"wake up\" in one\r\nof the most remarkable of British royal utterances, and Mr. Owen Seaman\r\nassures him in verse of an altogether laureate quality that we are now\r\n\r\n  \"Free of the snare of slumber's silken bands,\"\r\n\r\nthough I have not myself observed it. It is interesting to ask, Is\r\nEngland really waking up? and if she is, what sort of awakening is she\r\nlikely to have?\r\n\r\nIt is possible, of course, to wake up in various different ways. There\r\nis the clear and beautiful dawn of new and balanced effort, easy,\r\nunresting, planned, assured, and there is also the blundering-up of a\r\nstill half-somnolent man, irascible, clumsy, quarrelsome, who stubs his\r\ntoe in his first walk across the room, smashes his too persistent alarum\r\nclock in a fit of nerves, and cuts his throat while shaving. All\r\npatriotic vehemence does not serve one's country. Exertion is a more\r\ncritical and dangerous thing than inaction, and the essence of success\r\nis in the ability to develop those qualities which make action\r\neffective, and without which strenuousness is merely a clumsy and noisy\r\nprotest against inevitable defeat. These necessary qualities, without\r\nwhich no community may hope for pre-eminence to-day, are a passion for\r\nfine and brilliant achievement, relentless veracity of thought and\r\nmethod, and richly imaginative fearlessness of enterprise. Have we\r\nEnglish those qualities, and are we doing our utmost to select and\r\ndevelop them?\r\n\r\nI doubt very much if we are. Let me give some of the impressions that\r\nqualify my assurance in the future of our race.\r\n\r\nI have watched a great deal of patriotic effort during the last decade,\r\nI have seen enormous expenditures of will, emotion and material for the\r\nsake of our future, and I am deeply impressed, not indeed by any effect\r\nof lethargy, but by the second-rate quality and the shortness and\r\nweakness of aim in very much that has been done. I miss continually that\r\nsharply critical imaginativeness which distinguishes all excellent\r\nwork, which shines out supremely in Cromwell's creation of the New\r\nModel, or Nelson's plan of action at Trafalgar, as brightly as it does\r\nin Newton's investigation of gravitation, Turner's rendering of\r\nlandscape, or Shakespeare's choice of words, but which cannot be absent\r\naltogether if any achievement is to endure. We seem to have busy,\r\nenergetic people, no doubt, in abundance, patient and industrious\r\nadministrators and legislators; but have we any adequate supply of\r\nreally creative ability?\r\n\r\nLet me apply this question to one matter upon which England has\r\ncertainly been profoundly in earnest during the last decade. We have\r\nbeen almost frantically resolved to keep the empire of the sea. But have\r\nwe really done all that could have been done? I ask it with all\r\ndiffidence, but has our naval preparation been free from a sort of noisy\r\nviolence, a certain massive dullness of conception? Have we really made\r\nanything like a sane use of our resources? I do not mean of our\r\nresources in money or stuff. It is manifest that the next naval war will\r\nbe beyond all precedent a war of mechanisms, giving such scope for\r\ninvention and scientifically equipped wit and courage as the world has\r\nnever had before. Now, have we really developed any considerable\r\nproportion of the potential human quality available to meet the demand\r\nfor wits? What are we doing to discover, encourage and develop those\r\nsupreme qualities of personal genius that become more and more decisive\r\nwith every new weapon and every new complication and unsuspected\r\npossibility it introduces? Suppose, for example, there was among us\r\nto-day a one-eyed, one-armed adulterer, rather fragile, prone to\r\nsea-sickness, and with just that one supreme quality of imaginative\r\ncourage which made Nelson our starry admiral. Would he be given the\r\nghost of a chance now of putting that gift at his country's disposal? I\r\ndo not think he would, and I do not think he would because we underrate\r\ngifts and exceptional qualities, because there is no quickening\r\nappreciation for the exceptional best in a man, and because we overvalue\r\nthe good behaviour, the sound physique, the commonplace virtues of\r\nmediocrity.\r\n\r\nI have but the knowledge of the man in the street in these things,\r\nthough once or twice I have chanced on prophecy, and I am uneasily\r\napprehensive of the quality of all our naval preparations. We go on\r\nlaunching these lumping great Dreadnoughts, and I cannot bring myself to\r\nbelieve in them. They seem vulnerable from the air above and the deep\r\nbelow, vulnerable in a shallow channel and in a fog (and the North Sea\r\nis both foggy and shallow), and immensely costly. If I were Lord High\r\nAdmiral of England at war I would not fight the things. I would as soon\r\nput to sea in St. Paul's Cathedral. If I were fighting Germany, I would\r\nstow half of them away in the Clyde and half in the Bristol Channel, and\r\ntake the good men out of them and fight with mines and torpedoes and\r\ndestroyers and airships and submarines.\r\n\r\nAnd when I come to military matters my persuasion that things are not\r\nall right, that our current hostility to imaginative activity and our\r\ndull acceptance of established methods and traditions is leading us\r\ntowards grave dangers, intensifies. In South Africa the Boers taught us\r\nin blood and bitterness the obvious fact that barbed wire had its\r\nmilitary uses, and over the high passes on the way to Lhassa (though,\r\nluckily, it led to no disaster) there was not a rifle in condition to\r\nuse because we had not thought to take glycerine. The perpetual novelty\r\nof modern conditions demands an imaginative alertness we eliminate. I do\r\nnot believe that the Army Council or anyone in authority has worked out\r\na tithe of the essential problems of contemporary war. If they have,\r\nthen it does not show. Our military imagination is half-way back to bows\r\nand arrows. The other day I saw a detachment of the Legion of\r\nFrontiersmen disporting itself at Totteridge. I presume these young\r\nheroes consider they are preparing for a possible conflict in England or\r\nWestern Europe, and I presume the authorities are satisfied with them.\r\nIt is at any rate the only serious war of which there is any manifest\r\nprobability. Western Europe is now a network of railways, tramways, high\r\nroads, wires of all sorts; its chief beasts of burthen are the railway\r\ntrain and the motor car and the bicycle; towns and hypertrophied\r\nvillages are often practically continuous over large areas; there is\r\nabundant water and food, and the commonest form of cover is the house.\r\nBut the Legion of Frontiersmen is equipped for war, oh!--in Arizona in\r\n1890, and so far as I am able to judge the most modern sections of the\r\narmy extant are organised for a colonial war in (say) 1899 or 1900.\r\nThere is, of course, a considerable amount of vague energy demanding\r\nconscription and urging our youth towards a familiarity with arms and\r\nthe backwoodsman's life, but of any thought-out purpose in our arming\r\nwidely understood, of any realisation of what would have to be done and\r\nwhere it would have to be done, and of any attempts to create an\r\ninstrument for that novel unprecedented undertaking, I discover no\r\ntrace.\r\n\r\nIn my capacity of devil's advocate pleading against national\r\nover-confidence, I might go on to the quality of our social and\r\npolitical movements. One hears nowadays a vast amount of chatter about\r\nefficiency--that magic word--and social organisation, and there is no\r\ndoubt a huge expenditure of energy upon these things and a widespread\r\ndesire to rush about and make showy and startling changes. But it does\r\nnot follow that this involves progress if the enterprise itself is dully\r\nconceived and most of it does seem to me to be dully conceived. In the\r\nabsence of penetrating criticism, any impudent industrious person may\r\nset up as an \"expert,\" organise and direct the confused good intentions\r\nat large, and muddle disastrously with the problem in hand. The \"expert\"\r\nquack and the bureaucratic intriguer increase and multiply in a\r\ndull-minded, uncritical, strenuous period as disease germs multiply in\r\ndarkness and heat.\r\n\r\nI find the same doubts of our quality assail me when I turn to the\r\nsupreme business of education. It is true we all seem alive nowadays to\r\nthe need of education, are all prepared for more expenditure upon it and\r\nmore, but it does not follow necessarily in a period of stagnating\r\nimagination that we shall get what we pay for. The other day I\r\ndiscovered my little boy doing a subtraction sum, and I found he was\r\ndoing it in a slower, clumsier, less businesslike way than the one I was\r\ntaught in an old-fashioned \"Commercial Academy\" thirty odd years ago.\r\nThe educational \"expert,\" it seems, has been at work substituting a bad\r\nmethod for a good one in our schools because it is easier of exposition.\r\nThe educational \"expert,\" in the lack of a lively public intelligence,\r\ndevelops all the vices of the second-rate energetic, and he is, I am\r\nonly too disposed to believe, making a terrible mess of a great deal of\r\nour science teaching and of the teaching of mathematics and English....\r\n\r\nI have written enough to make clear the quality of my doubts. I think\r\nthe English mind cuts at life with a dulled edge, and that its energy\r\nmay be worse than its somnolence. I think it undervalues gifts and fine\r\nachievement, and overvalues the commonplace virtues of mediocre men. One\r\nof the greatest Liberal statesmen in the time of Queen Victoria never\r\nheld office because he was associated with a divorce case a quarter of a\r\ncentury ago. For him to have taken office would have been regarded as a\r\nscandal. But it is not regarded as a scandal that our Government\r\nincludes men of no more ability than any average assistant behind a\r\ngrocer's counter. These are your gods, O England!--and with every desire\r\nto be optimistic I find it hard under the circumstances to anticipate\r\nthat the New Epoch is likely to be a blindingly brilliant time for our\r\nEmpire and our race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILL THE EMPIRE LIVE?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat will hold such an Empire as the British together, this great, laxly\r\nscattered, sea-linked association of ancient states and new-formed\r\ncountries, Oriental nations, and continental colonies? What will enable\r\nit to resist the endless internal strains, the inevitable external\r\npressures and attacks to which it must be subjected This is the primary\r\nquestion for British Imperialism; everything else is secondary or\r\nsubordinated to that.\r\n\r\nThere is a multitude of answers. But I suppose most of them will prove\r\nunder examination either to be, or to lead to, or to imply very\r\ndistinctly this generalisation that if most of the intelligent and\r\nactive people in the Empire want it to continue it will, and that if a\r\nlarge proportion of such active and intelligent people are discontented\r\nand estranged, nothing can save it from disintegration. I do not suppose\r\nthat a navy ten times larger than ours, or conscription of the most\r\nirksome thoroughness, could oblige Canada to remain in the Empire if the\r\ngeneral will and feeling of Canada were against it, or coerce India into\r\na sustained submission if India presented a united and resistant front.\r\nOur Empire, for all its roll of battles, was not created by force;\r\ncolonisation and diplomacy have played a far larger share in its growth\r\nthan conquest; and there is no such strength in its sovereignty as the\r\nrule of pride and pressure demand. It is to the free consent and\r\nparticipation of its constituent peoples that we must look for its\r\ncontinuance.\r\n\r\nA large and influential body of politicians considers that in\r\npreferential trading between the parts of the Empire, and in the\r\nerection of a tariff wall against exterior peoples, lies the secret of\r\nthat deepened emotional understanding we all desire. I have never\r\nbelonged to that school. I am no impassioned Free Trader--the sacred\r\nprinciple of Free Trade has always impressed me as a piece of party\r\nclaptrap; but I have never been able to understand how an attempt to\r\ndraw together dominions so scattered and various as ours by a network of\r\nfiscal manipulation could end in anything but mutual inconvenience\r\nmutual irritation, and disruption.\r\n\r\nIn an open drawer in my bureau there lies before me now a crumpled card\r\non which are the notes I made of a former discussion of this very issue,\r\na discussion between a number of prominent politicians in the days\r\nbefore Mr. Chamberlain's return from South Africa and the adoption of\r\nTariff Reform by the Unionist Party; and I decipher again the same\r\nconsiderations, unanswered and unanswerable, that leave me sceptical\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nTake a map of the world and consider the extreme differences in position\r\nand condition between our scattered states. Here is Canada, lying along\r\nthe United States, looking eastward to Japan and China, westward to all\r\nEurope. See the great slashes of lake, bay, and mountain chain that cut\r\nit meridianally. Obviously its main routes and trades and relations lie\r\nnaturally north and south; obviously its full development can only be\r\nattained with those ways free, open, and active. Conceivably, you may\r\nbuild a fiscal wall across the continent; conceivably, you may shut off\r\nthe east and half the west by impossible tariffs, and narrow its trade\r\nto one artificial duct to England, but only at the price of a hampered\r\ndevelopment It will be like nourishing the growing body of a man with\r\nthe heart and arteries of a mouse.\r\n\r\nThen here, again, are New Zealand and Australia, facing South America\r\nand the teeming countries of Eastern Asia; surely it is in relation to\r\nthese vast proximities that their economic future lies. Is it possible\r\nto believe that shipping mutton to London is anything but the mere\r\nbeginning of their commercial development Look at India, again, and\r\nSouth Africa. Is it not manifest that from the economic and business\r\npoints of view each of these is an entirely separate entity, a system\r\napart, under distinct necessities, needing entire freedom to make its\r\nown bargains and control its trade in its own way in order to achieve\r\nits fullest material possibilities?\r\n\r\nNor can I believe that financial entanglements greatly strengthen the\r\nbonds of an empire in any case. We lost the American colonies because we\r\ninterfered with their fiscal arrangements, and it was Napoleon's attempt\r\nto strangle the Continental trade with Great Britain that began his\r\ndownfall.\r\n\r\nI do not find in the ordinary relations of life that business relations\r\nnecessarily sustain intercourse. The relations of buyer and seller are\r\nticklish relations, very liable to strains and conflicts. I do not find\r\npeople grow fond of their butchers and plumbers, and I doubt whether if\r\none were obliged by some special taxation to deal only with one butcher\r\nor one plumber, it would greatly endear the relationship. Forced buying\r\nis irritated buying, and it is the forbidden shop that contains the\r\ncoveted goods. Nor do I find, to take another instance, among the hotel\r\nstaffs of Switzerland and the Riviera--who live almost entirely upon\r\nBritish gold--those impassioned British imperialist views the economic\r\nlink theory would lead me to expect.\r\n\r\nAnd another link, too, upon which much stress is laid but about which I\r\nhave very grave doubts, is the possibility of a unified organisation of\r\nthe Empire for military defence. We are to have, it is suggested, an\r\nimperial Army and an imperial Navy, and so far, no doubt, as the\r\nguaranteeing of a general peace goes, we may develop a sense of\r\nparticipation in that way. But it is well in these islands to remember\r\nthat our extraordinary Empire has no common enemy to weld it together\r\nfrom without.\r\n\r\nIt is too usual to regard Germany as the common enemy. We in Great\r\nBritain are now intensely jealous of Germany. We are intensely jealous\r\nof Germany not only because the Germans outnumber us, and have a much\r\nlarger and more diversified country than ours, and lie in the very heart\r\nand body of Europe, but because in the last hundred years, while we have\r\nfed on platitudes and vanity, they have had the energy and humility to\r\ndevelop a splendid system of national education, to toil at science and\r\nart and literature, to develop social organisation, to master and better\r\nour methods of business and industry, and to clamber above us in the\r\nscale of civilisation. This has humiliated and irritated rather than\r\nchastened us, and our irritation has been greatly exacerbated by the\r\nswaggering bad manners, the talk of \"Blood and Iron\" and Mailed Fists,\r\nthe Welt-Politik rubbish that inaugurated the new German phase.\r\n\r\nThe British middle-class, therefore, is full of an angry, vague\r\ndisposition to thwart that expansion which Germans regard very\r\nreasonably as their natural destiny; there are all the possibilities of\r\na huge conflict in that disposition, and it is perhaps well to remember\r\nhow insular--or, at least, how European--the essentials of this quarrel\r\nare. We have lost our tempers, but Canada has not. There is nothing in\r\nGermany to make Canada envious and ashamed of wasted years. Canada has\r\nno natural quarrel with Germany, nor has India, nor South Africa, nor\r\nAustralasia. They have no reason to share our insular exasperation. On\r\nthe other hand, all these states have other special preoccupations. New\r\nZealand, for example, having spent half a century and more in\r\nsheep-farming, land legislation, suppressing its drink traffic, lowering\r\nits birth-rate, and, in short, the achievement of an ideal preventive\r\nmaterialism, is chiefly consumed by hate and fear of Japan, which in the\r\nsame interval has made a stride from the thirteenth to the twentieth\r\ncentury, and which teems with art and life and enterprise and offspring.\r\nNow Japan in Welt-Politik is our ally.\r\n\r\nYou see, the British Empire has no common economic interests and no\r\nnatural common enemy. It is not adapted to any form of Zollverein or any\r\nform of united aggression. Visibly, on the map of the world it has a\r\nlikeness to open hands, while the German Empire--except for a few\r\nill-advised and imitative colonies--is clenched into a central European\r\nunity.\r\n\r\nPhysically, our Empire is incurably scattered, various, and divided, and\r\nit is to quite other links and forces, it seems to me, than fiscal or\r\nmilitary unification that we who desire its continuance must look to\r\nhold it together. There never was anything like it before. Essentially\r\nit is an adventure of the British spirit, sanguine, discursive, and\r\nbeyond comparison insubordinate, adaptable, and originating. It has been\r\nmade by odd and irregular means by trading companies, pioneers,\r\nexplorers, unauthorised seamen, adventurers like Clive, eccentrics like\r\nGordon, invalids like Rhodes. It has been made, in spite of authority\r\nand officialdom, as no other empire was ever made. The nominal rulers of\r\nBritain never planned it. It happened almost in spite of them. Their\r\nchief contribution to its history has been the loss of the United\r\nStates. It is a living thing that has arisen, not a dead thing put\r\ntogether. Beneath the thin legal and administrative ties that hold it\r\ntogether lies the far more vital bond of a traditional free spontaneous\r\nactivity. It has a common medium of expression in the English tongue, a\r\nunity of liberal and tolerant purpose amidst its enormous variety of\r\nlocalised life and colour. And it is in the development and\r\nstrengthening, the enrichment the rendering more conscious and more\r\npurposeful, of that broad creative spirit of the British that the true\r\ncement and continuance of our Empire is to be found.\r\n\r\nThe Empire must live by the forces that begot it. It cannot hope to give\r\nany such exclusive prosperity as a Zollverein might afford; it can hold\r\nout no hopes of collective conquests and triumphs--its utmost military\r\nr\u00f4le must be the guaranteeing of a common inaggressive security; but it\r\ncan, if it is to survive, it must, give all its constituent parts such a\r\ncivilisation as none of them could achieve alone, a civilisation, a\r\nwealth and fullness of life increasing and developing with the years.\r\nThrough that, and that alone, can it be made worth having and worth\r\nserving.\r\n\r\nAnd in the first place the whole Empire must use the English language.\r\nI do not mean that any language must be stamped out, that a thousand\r\nlanguages may not flourish by board and cradle and in folk-songs and\r\nvillage gossip--Erse, the Taal, a hundred Indian and other Eastern\r\ntongues, Canadian French--but I mean that also English must be\r\navailable, that everywhere there must be English teaching. And everyone\r\nwho wants to read science or history or philosophy, to come out of the\r\nvillage life into wider thoughts and broader horizons, to gain\r\nappreciation in art, must find ready to hand, easily attainable in\r\nEnglish, all there is to know and all that has been said thereon. It is\r\nworth a hundred Dreadnoughts and a million soldiers to the Empire, that\r\nwherever the imperial posts reach, wherever there is a curious or\r\nreceptive mind, there in English and by the imperial connection the full\r\nthought of the race should come. To the lonely youth upon the New\r\nZealand sheep farm, to the young Hindu, to the trapper under a Labrador\r\ntilt, to the half-breed assistant at a Burmese oil-well, to the\r\nself-educating Scottish miner or the Egyptian clerk, the Empire and the\r\nEnglish language should exist, visibly and certainly, as the media by\r\nwhich his spirit escapes from his immediate surroundings and all the\r\nurgencies of every day, into a limitless fellowship of thought and\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nNow I am not writing this in any vague rhetorical way; I mean\r\nspecifically that our Empire has to become the medium of knowledge and\r\nthought to every intelligent person in it, or that it is bound to go to\r\npieces. It has no economic, no military, no racial, no religious unity.\r\nIts only conceivable unity is a unity of language and purpose and\r\noutlook. If it is not held together by thought and spirit, it cannot be\r\nheld together. No other cement exists that can hold it together\r\nindefinitely.\r\n\r\nNot only English literature, but all other literatures well translated\r\ninto English, and all science and all philosophy, have to be brought\r\nwithin the reach of everyone capable of availing himself of such\r\nreading. And this must be done, not by private enterprise or for gain,\r\nbut as an Imperial function. Wherever the Empire extends there its\r\npresence must signify all that breadth of thought and outlook no\r\nlocalised life can supply.\r\n\r\nOnly so is it possible to establish and maintain the wide\r\nunderstandings, the common sympathy necessary to our continued\r\nassociation. The Empire, mediately or immediately, must become the\r\nuniversal educator, news-agent, book-distributor, civiliser-general, and\r\nvehicle of imaginative inspiration for its peoples, or else it must\r\nsubmit to the gravitation of its various parts to new and more\r\ninvigorating associations.\r\n\r\nNo empire, it may be urged, has ever attempted anything of this sort,\r\nbut no empire like the British has ever yet existed. Its conditions and\r\nneeds are unprecedented, its consolidation is a new problem, to be\r\nsolved, if it is solved at all, by untried means. And in the English\r\nlanguage as a vehicle of thought and civilisation alone is that means to\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\nNow it is idle to pretend that at the present time the British Empire is\r\ngiving its constituent peoples any such high and rewarding civilisation\r\nas I am here suggesting. It gives them a certain immunity from warfare,\r\na penny post, an occasional spectacular coronation, a few knighthoods\r\nand peerages, and the services of an honest, unsympathetic,\r\nnarrow-minded, and unattractive officialism. No adequate effort is\r\nbeing made to render the English language universal throughout its\r\nlimits, none at all to use it as a medium of thought and enlightenment.\r\nHalf the good things of the human mind are outside English altogether,\r\nand there is not sufficient intelligence among us to desire to bring\r\nthem in. If one would read honest and able criticism, one must learn\r\nFrench; if one would be abreast of scientific knowledge and\r\nphilosophical thought, or see many good plays or understand the\r\ncontemporary European mind, German.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it would cost amazingly little to get every good foreign thing\r\ndone into English as it appeared. It needs only a little understanding\r\nand a little organisation to ensure the immediate translation of every\r\nsignificant article, every scientific paper of the slightest value. The\r\neffort and arrangement needed to make books, facilities for research,\r\nand all forms of art accessible throughout the Empire, would be\r\naltogether trivial in proportion to the consolidation it would effect.\r\n\r\nBut English people do not understand these things. Their Empire is an\r\naccident. It was made for them by their exceptional and outcast men, and\r\nin the end it will be lost, I fear, by the intellectual inertness of\r\ntheir commonplace and dull-minded leaders. Empire has happened to them\r\nand civilisation has happened to them as fresh lettuces come to tame\r\nrabbits. They do not understand how they got, and they will not\r\nunderstand how to keep. Art, thought, literature, all indeed that raises\r\nmen above locality and habit, all that can justify and consolidate the\r\nEmpire, is nothing to them. They are provincials mocked by a world-wide\r\nopportunity, the stupid legatees of a great generation of exiles. They\r\ngo out of town for the \"shootin',\" and come back for the fooleries of\r\nParliament, and to see what the Censor has left of our playwrights and\r\nSir Jesse Boot of our writers, and to dine in restaurants and wear\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nMostly they call themselves Imperialists, which is just their harmless\r\nway of expressing their satisfaction with things as they are. In\r\npractice their Imperialism resolves itself into a vigorous resistance to\r\ntaxation and an ill-concealed hostility to education. It matters nothing\r\nto them that the whole next generation of Canadians has drawn its ideas\r\nmainly from American publications, that India and Egypt, in despite of\r\nsounder mental nourishment, have developed their own vernacular Press,\r\nthat Australia and New Zealand even now gravitate to America for books\r\nand thought. It matters nothing to them that the poverty and insularity\r\nof our intellectual life has turned American art to France and Italy,\r\nand the American universities towards Germany. The slow starvation and\r\ndecline of our philosophy and science, the decadence of British\r\ninvention and enterprise, troubles them not at all, because they fail to\r\nconnect these things with the tangible facts of empire. \"The world\r\ncannot wait for the English.\" ... And the sands of our Imperial\r\nopportunity twirl through the neck of the hour-glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LABOUR UNREST\r\n\r\n(_May, 1912_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1\r\n\r\nOur country is, I think, in a dangerous state of social disturbance. The\r\ndiscontent of the labouring mass of the community is deep and\r\nincreasing. It may be that we are in the opening phase of a real and\r\nirreparable class war.\r\n\r\nSince the Coronation we have moved very rapidly indeed from an assurance\r\nof extreme social stability towards the recognition of a spreading\r\ndisorganisation. It is idle to pretend any longer that these Labour\r\ntroubles are the mere give and take of economic adjustment. No\r\nadjustment is in progress. New and strange urgencies are at work in our\r\nmidst, forces for which the word \"revolutionary\" is only too faithfully\r\nappropriate. Nothing is being done to allay these forces; everything\r\nconspires to exasperate them.\r\n\r\nWhither are these forces taking us? What can still be done and what has\r\nto be done to avoid the phase of social destruction to which we seem to\r\nbe drifting?\r\n\r\nHitherto, in Great Britain at any rate, the working man has shown\r\nhimself a being of the most limited and practical outlook. His\r\nnarrowness of imagination, his lack of general ideas, has been the\r\ndespair of the Socialist and of every sort of revolutionary theorist. He\r\nmay have struck before, but only for definite increments of wages or\r\ndefinite limitations of toil; his acceptance of the industrial system\r\nand its methods has been as complete and unquestioning as his acceptance\r\nof earth and sky. Now, with an effect of suddenness, this ceases to be\r\nthe case. A new generation of workers is seen replacing the old, workers\r\nof a quality unfamiliar to the middle-aged and elderly men who still\r\nmanage our great businesses and political affairs. The worker is\r\nbeginning now to strike for unprecedented ends--against the system,\r\nagainst the fundamental conditions of labour, to strike for no defined\r\nends at all, perplexingly and disconcertingly. The old-fashioned strike\r\nwas a method of bargaining, clumsy and violent perhaps, but bargaining\r\nstill; the new-fashioned strike is far less of a haggle, far more of a\r\ndisplay of temper. The first thing that has to be realised if the Labour\r\nquestion is to be understood at all is this, that the temper of Labour\r\nhas changed altogether in the last twenty or thirty years. Essentially\r\nthat is a change due to intelligence not merely increased but greatly\r\nstimulated, to the work, that is, of the board schools and of the cheap\r\nPress. The outlook of the workman has passed beyond the works and his\r\nbeer and his dog. He has become--or, rather, he has been replaced by--a\r\nbeing of eyes, however imperfect, and of criticism, however hasty and\r\nunjust. The working man of to-day reads, talks, has general ideas and a\r\nsense of the round world; he is far nearer to the ruler of to-day in\r\nknowledge and intellectual range than he is to the working man of fifty\r\nyears ago. The politician or business magnate of to-day is no better\r\neducated and very little better informed than his equals were fifty\r\nyears ago. The chief difference is golf. The working man questions a\r\nthousand things his father accepted as in the very nature of the world,\r\nand among others he begins to ask with the utmost alertness and\r\npersistence why it is that he in particular is expected to toil. The\r\nanswer, the only justifiable answer, should be that that is the work for\r\nwhich he is fitted by his inferior capacity and culture, that these\r\nothers are a special and select sort, very specially trained and\r\nprepared for their responsibilities, and that at once brings this new\r\nfact of a working-class criticism of social values into play. The old\r\nworkman might and did quarrel very vigorously with his specific\r\nemployer, but he never set out to arraign all employers; he took the law\r\nand the Church and Statecraft and politics for the higher and noble\r\nthings they claimed to be. He wanted an extra shilling or he wanted an\r\nhour of leisure, and that was as much as he wanted. The young workman,\r\non the other hand, has put the whole social system upon its trial, and\r\nseems quite disposed to give an adverse verdict. He looks far beyond the\r\nolder conflict of interests between employer and employed. He criticises\r\nthe good intentions of the whole system of governing and influential\r\npeople, and not only their good intentions, but their ability. These are\r\nthe new conditions, and the middle-aged and elderly gentlemen who are\r\ndealing with the crisis on the supposition that their vast experience of\r\nLabour questions in the 'seventies and 'eighties furnishes valuable\r\nguidance in this present issue are merely bringing the gunpowder of\r\nmisapprehension to the revolutionary fort.\r\n\r\nThe workman of the new generation is full of distrust the most\r\ndemoralising of social influences. He is like a sailor who believes no\r\nlonger either in the good faith or seamanship of his captain, and,\r\nbetween desperation and contempt, contemplates vaguely but persistently\r\nthe assumption of control by a collective forecastle. He is like a\r\nprivate soldier obsessed with the idea that nothing can save the\r\nsituation but the death of an incompetent officer. His distrust is so\r\nprofound that he ceases not only to believe in the employer, but he\r\nceases to believe in the law, ceases to believe in Parliament, as a\r\nmeans to that tolerable life he desires; and he falls back steadily upon\r\nhis last resource of a strike, and--if by repressive tactics we make it\r\nso--a criminal strike. The central fact of all this present trouble is\r\nthat distrust. There is only one way in which our present drift towards\r\nrevolution or revolutionary disorder can be arrested, and that is by\r\nrestoring the confidence of these alienated millions, who visibly now\r\nare changing from loyalty to the Crown, from a simple patriotism, from\r\nhabitual industry, to the more and more effective expression of a\r\ndeepening resentment.\r\n\r\nThis is a psychological question, a matter of mental states. Feats of\r\nlegal subtlety are inopportune, arithmetical exploits still more so. To\r\nemerge with the sum of 4s. 6-1/2d. as a minimum, by calculating on the\r\nbasis of the mine's present earnings, from a conference which the miners\r\nand everybody else imagined was to give a minimum of 5s., may be clever,\r\nbut it is certainly not politic in the present stage of Labour feeling.\r\nTo stamp violently upon obscure newspapers nobody had heard of before\r\nand send a printer to prison, and to give thereby a flaming\r\nadvertisement to the possible use of soldiers in civil conflicts and set\r\nevery barrack-room talking, may be permissible, but it is certainly very\r\nill-advised. The distrust deepens.\r\n\r\nThe real task before a governing class that means to go on governing is\r\nnot just at present to get the better of an argument or the best of a\r\nbargain, but to lay hold of the imaginations of this drifting, sullen\r\nand suspicious multitude, which is the working body of the country. What\r\nwe prosperous people, who have nearly all the good things of life and\r\nmost of the opportunity, have to do now is to justify ourselves. We have\r\nto show that we are indeed responsible and serviceable, willing to give\r\nourselves, and to give ourselves generously for what we have and what we\r\nhave had. We have to meet the challenge of this distrust.\r\n\r\nThe slack days for rulers and owners are over. If there are still to be\r\nrulers and owners and managing and governing people, then in the face of\r\nthe new masses, sensitive, intelligent, critical, irritable, as no\r\ncommon people have ever been before, these rulers and owners must be\r\nprepared to make themselves and display themselves wise, capable and\r\nheroic--beyond any aristocratic precedent. The alternative, if it is an\r\nalternative, is resignation--to the Social Democracy.\r\n\r\nAnd it is just because we are all beginning to realise the immense need\r\nfor this heroic quality in those who rule and are rich and powerful, as\r\nthe response and corrective to these distrusts and jealousies that are\r\nthreatening to disintegrate our social order, that we have all followed\r\nthe details of this great catastrophe in the Atlantic with such intense\r\nsolicitude. It was one of those accidents that happen with a precision\r\nof time and circumstance that outdoes art; not an incident in it all\r\nthat was not supremely typical. It was the penetrating comment of chance\r\nupon our entire social situation. Beneath a surface of magnificent\r\nefficiency was--slap-dash. The third-class passengers had placed\r\nthemselves on board with an infinite confidence in the care that was to\r\nbe taken of them, and they went down, and most of their women and\r\nchildren went down with the cry of those who find themselves cheated out\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nIn the unfolding record of behaviour it is the stewardesses and bandsmen\r\nand engineers--persons of the trade-union class--who shine as brightly\r\nas any. And by the supreme artistry of Chance it fell to the lot of that\r\ntragic and unhappy gentleman, Mr. Bruce Ismay, to be aboard and to be\r\ncaught by the urgent vacancy in the boat and the snare of the moment. No\r\nuntried man dare say that he would have behaved better in his place. He\r\nescaped. He thought it natural to escape. His class thinks it was right\r\nand proper that he did escape. It is not the man I would criticise, but\r\nthe manifest absence of any such sense of the supreme dignity of his\r\nposition as would have sustained him in that crisis. He was a rich man\r\nand a ruling man, but in the test he was not a proud man. In the common\r\nman's realisation that such is indeed the case with most of those who\r\ndominate our world, lies the true cause and danger of our social\r\nindiscipline. And the remedy in the first place lies not in social\r\nlegislation and so forth, but in the consciences of the wealthy. Heroism\r\nand a generous devotion to the common good are the only effective answer\r\nto distrust. If such dominating people cannot produce these qualities\r\nthere will have to be an end to them, and the world must turn to some\r\nentirely different method of direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2\r\n\r\nThe essential trouble in our growing Labour disorder is the profound\r\ndistrust which has grown up in the minds of the new generation of\r\nworkers of either the ability or the good faith of the property owning,\r\nruling and directing class. I do not attempt to judge the justice or not\r\nof this distrust; I merely point to its existence as one of the striking\r\nand essential factors in the contemporary Labour situation.\r\n\r\nThis distrust is not, perhaps, the proximate cause of the strikes that\r\nnow follow each other so disconcertingly, but it embitters their spirit,\r\nit prevents their settlement, and leads to their renewal. I have tried\r\nto suggest that, whatever immediate devices for pacification might be\r\nemployed, the only way to a better understanding and co-operation, the\r\nonly escape from a social slide towards the unknown possibilities of\r\nSocial Democracy, lies in an exaltation of the standard of achievement\r\nand of the sense of responsibility in the possessing and governing\r\nclasses. It is not so much \"Wake up, England!\" that I would say as \"Wake\r\nup, gentlemen!\"--for the new generation of the workers is beyond all\r\nquestion quite alarmingly awake and critical and angry. And they have\r\nnot merely to wake up, they have to wake up visibly and ostentatiously\r\nif those old class reliances on which our system is based are to be\r\npreserved and restored.\r\n\r\nWe need before anything else a restoration of class confidence. It is a\r\ntime when class should speak with class very frankly.\r\n\r\nThere is too much facile misrepresentation, too ready a disposition on\r\neither side to accept caricatures as portraits and charges as facts.\r\nHowever tacit our understandings were in the past, with this new kind of\r\nLabour, this young, restive Labour of the twentieth century, which can\r\nread, discuss and combine, we need something in the nature of a social\r\ncontract. And it is when one comes to consider by what possible means\r\nthese suspicious third-class passengers in our leaking and imperilled\r\nsocial liner can be brought into generous co-operation with the second\r\nand the first that one discovers just how lamentably out of date and out\r\nof order our political institutions, which should supply the means for\r\njust this inter-class discussion, have become. Between the busy and\r\npreoccupied owning and employing class on the one hand, and the\r\ndistressed, uneasy masses on the other, intervenes the professional\r\npolitician, not as a mediator, but as an obstacle, who must be\r\npropitiated before any dealings are possible. Our national politics no\r\nlonger express the realities of the national life; they are a mere\r\nimpediment in the speech of the community. With our whole social order\r\nin danger, our Legislature is busy over the trivial little affairs of\r\nthe Welsh Established Church, whose endowment probably is not equal to\r\nthe fortune of any one of half a dozen _Titanic_ passengers or a tithe\r\nof the probable loss of another strike among the miners. We have a\r\nLegislature almost antiquarian, compiling a museum of Gladstonian\r\nlegacies rather than governing our world to-day.\r\n\r\nLaw is the basis of civilisation, but the lawyer is the law's\r\nconsequence, and, with us at least, the legal profession is the\r\npolitical profession. It delights in false issues and merely technical\r\npolitics. Steadily with the ascendancy of the House of Commons the\r\nbarristers have ousted other types of men from political power. The\r\ndecline of the House of Lords has been the last triumph of the House of\r\nLawyers, and we are governed now to a large extent not so much by the\r\npeople for the people as by the barristers for the barristers. They set\r\nthe tone of political life. And since they are the most specialised, the\r\nmost specifically trained of all the professions, since their training\r\nis absolutely antagonistic to the creative impulses of the constructive\r\nartist and the controlled experiments of the scientific man, since the\r\nbusiness is with evidence and advantages and the skilful use of evidence\r\nand advantages, and not with understanding, they are the least\r\nstatesmanlike of all educated men, and they give our public life a tone\r\nas hopelessly discordant with our very great and urgent social needs as\r\none could well imagine. They do not want to deal at all with great and\r\nurgent social needs. They play a game, a long and interesting game, with\r\nparties as sides, a game that rewards the industrious player with\r\nprominence, place, power and great rewards, and the less that game\r\ninvolves the passionate interests of other men, the less it draws them\r\ninto participation and angry interference, the better for the steady\r\ndevelopment of the politician's career. A distinguished and active\r\nfruitlessness, leaving the world at last as he found it, is the\r\npolitical barrister's ideal career. To achieve that, he must maintain\r\nlegal and political monopolies, and prevent the invasion of political\r\nlife by living interests. And so far as he has any views about Labour\r\nbeyond the margin of his brief, the barrister politician seems to regard\r\ngetting men back to work on any terms and as soon as possible as the\r\nhighest good.\r\n\r\nAnd it is with such men that our insurgent modern Labour, with its\r\nvaguely apprehended wants, its large occasions and its rapid emotional\r\nreactions, comes into contact directly it attempts to adjust itself in\r\nthe social body. It is one of the main factors in the progressive\r\nembitterment of the Labour situation that whatever business is\r\nafoot--arbitration, conciliation, inquiry--our contemporary system\r\npresents itself to Labour almost invariably in a legal guise. The\r\nnatural infirmities of humanity rebel against an unimaginative legality\r\nof attitude, and the common workaday man has no more love for this great\r\nand necessary profession to-day than he had in the time of Jack Cade.\r\nLittle reasonable things from the lawyers' point of view--the rejection,\r\nfor example, of certain evidence in the _Titanic_ inquiry because it\r\nmight amount to a charge of manslaughter, the constant interruption and\r\nchecking of a Labour representative at the same tribunal upon trivial\r\npoints--irritate quite disproportionately.\r\n\r\nLawyer and working man are antipathetic types, and it is a very grave\r\nnational misfortune that at this time, when our situation calls aloud\r\nfor statecraft and a certain greatness of treatment, our public life\r\nshould be dominated as it has never been dominated before by this most\r\nable and illiberal profession.\r\n\r\nNow for that great multitude of prosperous people who find themselves at\r\nonce deeply concerned in our present social and economic crisis, and\r\neither helplessly entangled in party organisation or helplessly outside\r\npolitics, the elimination and cure of this disease of statecraft, the\r\nprofessional politician, has become a very urgent matter. To destroy\r\nhim, to get him back to his law courts and keep him there, it is\r\nnecessary to destroy the machinery of the party system that sustains\r\nhim, and to adopt some electoral method that will no longer put the\r\nindependent representative man at a hopeless disadvantage against the\r\nparty nominee. Such a method is to be found in proportional\r\nrepresentation with large constituencies, and to that we must look for\r\nour ultimate liberation from our present masters, these politician\r\nbarristers. But the Labour situation cannot wait for this millennial\r\nrelease, and for the current issue it seems to me patent that every\r\nreasonable prosperous man will, even at the cost to himself of some\r\ntrouble and hard thinking, do his best to keep as much of this great and\r\nacute controversy as he possibly can out of the lawyer's and mere\r\npolitician's hands and in his own. Leave Labour to the lawyers, and we\r\nshall go very deeply into trouble indeed before this business is over.\r\nThey will score their points, they will achieve remarkable agreements\r\nfull of the possibility of subsequent surprises, they will make\r\nreputations, and do everything Heaven and their professional training\r\nhave made them to do, and they will exasperate and exasperate!\r\n\r\nLawyers made the first French Revolution, and now, on a different side,\r\nthey may yet bring about an English one. These men below there are\r\nstill, as a class, wonderfully patient and reasonable, quite prepared to\r\ntake orders and recognise superior knowledge, wisdom and nobility. They\r\nmake the most reasonable claims for a tolerable life, for certain\r\nassurances and certain latitudes. Implicit rather than expressed is\r\ntheir demand for wisdom and right direction from those to whom the great\r\nsurplus and freedom of civilisation are given. It is an entirely\r\nreasonable demand if man is indeed a social animal. But we have got to\r\ntreat them fairly and openly. This patience and reasonableness and\r\nwillingness for leadership is not limitless. It is no good scoring our\r\nmean little points, for example, and accusing them of breach of contract\r\nand all sorts of theoretical wrongs because they won't abide by\r\nagreements to accept a certain scale of wages when the purchasing power\r\nof money has declined. When they made that agreement they did not think\r\nof that possibility. When they said a pound they thought of what was\r\nthen a poundsworth of living. The Mint has since been increasing its\r\nannual output of gold coins to two or three times the former amount, and\r\nwe have, as it were, debased the coinage with extraordinary quantities\r\nof gold. But we who know and own did nothing to adjust that; we did not\r\ntell the working man of that; we have let him find it out slowly and\r\nindirectly at the grocer's shop. That may be permissible from the\r\nlawyer's point of view, but it certainly isn't from the gentleman's, and\r\nit is only by the plea that its inequalities give society a gentleman\r\nthat our present social system can claim to endure.\r\n\r\nI would like to accentuate that, because if we are to emerge again from\r\nthese acute social dissensions a reunited and powerful people, there has\r\nto be a change of tone, a new generosity on the part of those who deal\r\nwith Labour speeches, Labour literature, Labour representatives, and\r\nLabour claims. Labour is necessarily at an enormous disadvantage in\r\ndiscussion; in spite of a tremendous inferiority in training and\r\neducation it is trying to tell the community its conception of its needs\r\nand purposes. It is not only young as a participator in the discussion\r\nof affairs; it is actually young. The average working man is not half\r\nthe age of the ripe politicians and judges and lawyers and wealthy\r\norganisers who trip him up legally, accuse him of bad faith, mark his\r\nevery inconsistency. It isn't becoming so to use our forensic\r\nadvantages. It isn't--if that has no appeal to you--wise.\r\n\r\nThe thing our society has most to fear from Labour is not organised\r\nresistance, not victorious strikes and raised conditions, but the black\r\nresentment that follows defeat. Meet Labour half-way, and you will find\r\na new co-operation in government; stick to your legal rights, draw the\r\nnet of repressive legislation tighter, then you will presently have to\r\ndeal with Labour enraged. If the anger burns free, that means\r\nrevolution; if you crush out the hope of that, then sabotage and a\r\nsullen general sympathy for anarchistic crime.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3\r\n\r\nIn the preceding pages I have discussed certain aspects of the present\r\nLabour situation. I have tried to show the profound significance in this\r\ndiscussion of the distrust which has grown up in the minds of the\r\nworkers, and how this distrust is being exacerbated by our entirely too\r\nforensic method of treating their claims. I want now to point out a\r\nstill more powerful set of influences which is steadily turning our\r\nLabour struggles from mere attempts to adjust hours and wages into\r\nmovements that are gravely and deliberately revolutionary.\r\n\r\nThis is the obvious devotion of a large and growing proportion of the\r\ntime and energy of the owning and ruling classes to pleasure and\r\nexcitement, and the way in which this spectacle of amusement and\r\nadventure is now being brought before the eyes and into the imagination\r\nof the working man.\r\n\r\nThe intimate psychology of work is a thing altogether too little\r\nconsidered and discussed. One asks: \"What keeps a workman working\r\nproperly at his work?\" and it seems a sufficient answer to say that it\r\nis the need of getting a living. But that is not the complete answer.\r\nWork must to some extent interest; if it bores, no power on earth will\r\nkeep a man doing it properly. And the tendency of modern industrialism\r\nhas been to subdivide processes and make work more boring and irksome.\r\nAlso the workman must be satisfied with the living he is getting, and\r\nthe tendency of newspaper, theatre, cinematograph show and so forth is\r\nto fill his mind with ideas of ways of living infinitely more agreeable\r\nand interesting than his own. Habit also counts very largely in the\r\nregular return of the man to his job, and the fluctuations of\r\nemployment, the failure of the employing class to provide any\r\nalternative to idleness during slack time, break that habit of industry.\r\nAnd then, last but not least, there is self-respect. Men and women are\r\ncapable of wonders of self-discipline and effort if they feel that\r\ntheirs is a meritorious service, if they imagine the thing they are\r\ndoing is the thing they ought to do. A miner will cut coal in a\r\ndifferent spirit and with a fading zest if he knows his day's output is\r\nto be burnt to waste secretly by a lunatic. Man is a social animal; few\r\nmen are naturally social rebels, and most will toil very cheerfully in\r\nsubordination if they feel that the collective end is a fine thing and a\r\ngreat thing.\r\n\r\nNow, this force of self-respect is much more acutely present in the mind\r\nof the modern worker than it was in the thought of his fathers. He is\r\nintellectually more active than his predecessors, his imagination is\r\nrelatively stimulated, he asks wide questions. The worker of a former\r\ngeneration took himself for granted; it is a new phase when the toilers\r\nbegin to ask, not one man here or there, but in masses, in battalions,\r\nin trades: \"Why, then, are _we_ toilers, and for what is it that we\r\ntoil?\"\r\n\r\nWhat answer do we give them?\r\n\r\nI ask the reader to put himself in the place of a good workman, a young,\r\ncapable miner, let us say, in search of an answer to that question. He\r\nis, we will suppose, temporarily unemployed through the production of a\r\nglut of coal, and he goes about the world trying to see the fine and\r\nnoble collective achievements that justify the devotion of his whole\r\nlife to humble toil. I ask the reader: What have we got to show that\r\nman? What are we doing up in the light and air that justifies our demand\r\nthat he should go on hewing in narrow seams and cramped corners until he\r\ncan hew no more? Where is he to be taken to see these crowning fruits of\r\nour release from toil? Shall we take him to the House of Commons to note\r\nwhich of the barristers is making most headway over Welsh\r\nDisestablishment, or shall we take him to the _Titanic_ inquiry to hear\r\nthe latest about those fifty-five third-class children (out of\r\neighty-three) who were drowned? Shall we give him an hour or so among\r\nthe portraits at the Royal Academy, or shall we make an enthusiastic\r\ntour of London sculpture and architecture and saturate his soul with the\r\nbeauty he makes possible? The new Automobile Club, for example. \"Without\r\nyou and your subordination we could not have had that.\" Or suppose we\r\ntook him the round of the West-End clubs and restaurants and made him\r\nestimate how many dinners London can produce at a pinch at the price of\r\nhis local daily minimum, say, and upward; or borrow an aeroplane at\r\nHendon and soar about counting all the golfers in the Home Counties on\r\nany week-day afternoon. \"You suffer at the roots of things, far below\r\nthere, but see all this nobility and splendour, these sweet, bright\r\nflowers to which your rootlet life contributes.\" Or we might spend a\r\npleasant morning trying to get a passable woman's hat for the price of\r\nhis average weekly wages in some West-End shop....\r\n\r\nBut indeed this thing is actually happening. The older type of miner was\r\nilliterate, incurious; he read nothing, lived his own life, and if he\r\nhad any intellectual and spiritual urgencies in him beyond eating and\r\ndrinking and dog-fighting, the local little Bethel shunted them away\r\nfrom any effective social criticism. The new generation of miners is on\r\nan altogether different basis. It is at once less brutal and less\r\nspiritual; it is alert, informed, sceptical, and the Press, with\r\nphotographic illustrations, the cinema, and a score of collateral\r\nforces, are giving it precisely that spectacular view of luxury,\r\namusement, aimlessness and excitement, taunting it with just that\r\nsuggestion that it is for that, and that alone, that the worker's back\r\naches and his muscles strain. Whatever gravity and spaciousness of aim\r\nthere may be in our prosperous social life does not appear to him. He\r\nsees, and he sees all the more brightly because he is looking at it out\r\nof toil and darkness, the glitter, the delight for delight's sake, the\r\nshow and the pride and the folly. Cannot you understand how it is that\r\nthese young men down there in the hot and dangerous and toilsome and\r\ninglorious places of life are beginning to cry out, \"We are being made\r\nfools of,\" and to fling down their tools, and cannot you see how futile\r\nit is to dream that Mr. Asquith or some other politician by some trick\r\nof a Conciliation Act or some claptrap of Compulsory Arbitration, or\r\nthat any belated suppression of discussion and strike organisations by\r\nthe law, will avert this gathering storm? The Spectacle of Pleasure, the\r\nparade of clothes, estates, motor-cars, luxury and vanity in the sight\r\nof the workers is the culminating irritant of Labour. So long as that\r\ngoes on, this sombre resolve to which we are all awakening, this sombre\r\nresolve rather to wreck the whole fabric than to continue patiently at\r\nwork, will gather strength. It does not matter that such a resolve is\r\nhopeless and unseasonable; we are dealing here with the profounder\r\nimpulses that underlie reason. Crush this resentment; it will recur with\r\naccumulated strength.\r\n\r\nIt does not matter that there is no plan in existence for any kind of\r\nsocial order that could be set up in the place of our present system; no\r\nplan, that is, that will endure half an hour's practical criticism. The\r\ncardinal fact before us is that the workers do not intend to stand\r\nthings as they are, and that no clever arguments, no expert handling of\r\nlegal points, no ingenious appearances of concession, will stay that\r\nprogressive embitterment.\r\n\r\nBut I think I have said enough to express and perhaps convey my\r\nconviction that our present Labour troubles are unprecedented, and that\r\nthey mean the end of an epoch. The supply of good-tempered, cheap\r\nlabour--upon which the fabric of our contemporary ease and comfort is\r\nerected--is giving out. The spread of information and the means of\r\npresentation in every class and the increase of luxury and\r\nself-indulgence in the prosperous classes are the chief cause of that.\r\nIn the place of that old convenient labour comes a new sort of labour,\r\nreluctant, resentful, critical, and suspicious. The replacement has\r\nalready gone so far that I am certain that attempts to baffle and coerce\r\nthe workers back to their old conditions must inevitably lead to a\r\nseries of increasingly destructive outbreaks, to stresses and disorder\r\nculminating in revolution. It is useless to dream of going on now for\r\nmuch longer upon the old lines; our civilisation, if it is not to enter\r\nupon a phase of conflict and decay, must begin to adapt itself to the\r\nnew conditions of which the first and foremost is that the wages-earning\r\nlabouring class as a distinctive class, consenting to a distinctive\r\ntreatment and accepting life at a disadvantage is going to disappear.\r\nWhether we do it soon as the result of our reflections upon the present\r\nsituation, or whether we do it presently through the impoverishment that\r\nmust necessarily result from a lengthening period of industrial unrest,\r\nthere can be little doubt that we are going to curtail very considerably\r\nthe current extravagance of the spending and directing classes upon\r\nfood, clothing, display, and all the luxuries of life. The phase of\r\naffluence is over. And unless we are to be the mere passive spectators\r\nof an unprecedented reduction of our lives, all of us who have leisure\r\nand opportunity have to set ourselves very strenuously to the problem\r\nnot of reconciling ourselves to the wage-earners, for that possibility\r\nis over, but of establishing a new method of co-operation with those who\r\nseem to be definitely decided not to remain wage-earners for very much\r\nlonger. We have, as sensible people, to realise that the old arrangement\r\nwhich has given us of the fortunate minority so much leisure, luxury,\r\nand abundance, advantages we have as a class put to so vulgar and\r\nunprofitable a use, is breaking down, and that we have to discover a\r\nnew, more equable way of getting the world's work done.\r\n\r\nCertain things stand out pretty obviously. It is clear that in the times\r\nahead of us there must be more economy in giving trouble and causing\r\nwork, a greater willingness to do work for ourselves, a great economy of\r\nlabour through machinery and skilful management. So much is unavoidable\r\nif we are to meet these enlarged requirements upon which the insurgent\r\nworker insists. If we, who have at least some experience of affairs, who\r\nown property, manage businesses, and discuss and influence public\r\norganisation, if we are not prepared to undertake this work of\r\ndiscipline and adaptation for ourselves, then a time is not far distant\r\nwhen insurrectionary leaders, calling themselves Socialists or\r\nSyndicalists, or what not, men with none of our experience, little of\r\nour knowledge, and far less hope of success, will take that task out of\r\nour hands.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Larkinism comes to endorse me since this was written.]\r\n\r\nWe have, in fact, to \"pull ourselves together,\" as the phrase goes, and\r\nmake an end to all this slack, extravagant living, this spectacle of\r\npleasure, that has been spreading and intensifying in every civilised\r\ncommunity for the last three or four decades. What is happening to\r\nLabour is indeed, from one point of view, little else than the\r\ncorrelative of what has been happening to the more prosperous classes in\r\nthe community. They have lost their self-discipline, their gravity,\r\ntheir sense of high aims, they have become the victims of their\r\nadvantages and Labour, grown observant and intelligent, has discovered\r\nitself and declares itself no longer subordinate. Just what powers of\r\nrecovery and reconstruction our system may have under these\r\ncircumstances the decades immediately before us will show.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 4\r\n\r\nLet us try to anticipate some of the social developments that are likely\r\nto spring out of the present Labour situation.\r\n\r\nIt is quite conceivable, of course, that what lies before us is not\r\ndevelopment but disorder. Given sufficient suspicion on one side and\r\nsufficient obstinacy and trickery on the other, it may be impossible to\r\nrestore social peace in any form, and industrialism may degenerate into\r\na wasteful and incurable conflict. But that distressful possibility is\r\nthe worst and perhaps the least probable of many. It is much more\r\nacceptable to suppose that our social order will be able to adjust\r\nitself to the new outlook and temper and quality of the labour stratum\r\nthat elementary education, a Press very cheap and free, and a period of\r\ngreat general affluence have brought about.\r\n\r\nOne almost inevitable feature of any such adaptation will be a changed\r\nspirit in the general body of society. We have come to a serious\r\ncondition of our affairs, and we shall not get them into order again\r\nwithout a thorough bracing-up of ourselves in the process. There can be\r\nno doubt that for a large portion of our comfortable classes existence\r\nhas been altogether too easy for the last lifetime or so. The great bulk\r\nof the world's work has been done out of their sight and knowledge; it\r\nhas seemed unnecessary to trouble much about the general conduct of\r\nthings, unnecessary, as they say, to \"take life too seriously.\" This has\r\nnot made them so much vicious as slack, lazy, and over-confident; there\r\nhas been an elaboration of trivial things and a neglect of troublesome\r\nand important things. The one grave shock of the Boer War has long been\r\nexplained and sentimentalised away. But it will not be so easy to\r\nexplain away a dislocated train service and an empty coal cellar as it\r\nwas to get a favourable interpretation upon some demonstration of\r\nnational incompetence half the world away.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed no disaster, but a matter for sincere congratulation that\r\nthe British prosperous and the British successful, to whom warning after\r\nwarning has rained in vain from the days of Ruskin, Carlyle, Matthew\r\nArnold, should be called to account at last in their own household. They\r\nwill grumble, they will be very angry, but in the end, I believe, they\r\nwill rise to the opportunities of their inconvenience. They will shake\r\noff their intellectual lassitude, take over again the public and private\r\naffairs they have come to leave so largely in the hands of the political\r\nbarrister and the family solicitor, become keen and critical and\r\nconstructive, bring themselves up to date again.\r\n\r\nThat is not, of course, inevitable, but I am taking now the more hopeful\r\nview.\r\n\r\nAnd then? What sort of working arrangements are our renascent owning and\r\ndirecting classes likely to make with the new labouring class? How is\r\nthe work going to be done in the harder, cleaner, more equalised, and\r\nbetter managed State that, in one's hopeful mood, one sees ahead of us?\r\n\r\nNow after the experiences of the past twelve months it is obvious that\r\nthe days when most of the directed and inferior work of the community\r\nwill be done by intermittently employed and impecunious wage-earners is\r\ndrawing to an end. A large part of the task of reconstruction ahead of\r\nus will consist in the working out of schemes for a more permanent type\r\nof employment and for a direct participation of the worker in the pride,\r\nprofits, and direction of the work. Such schemes admit of wide\r\nvariations between a mere bonus system, a periodic tipping of the\r\nemployees to prevent their striking and a real and honest co-partnery.\r\n\r\nIn the latter case a great enterprise, forced to consider its \"hands\" as\r\nbeing also in their degree \"heads,\" would include a department of\r\ntechnical and business instruction for its own people. From such ideas\r\none passes very readily to the conception of guild-managed businesses in\r\nwhich the factor of capital would no longer stand out as an element\r\ndistinct from and contrasted with the proprietorship of the workers. One\r\nsees the worker as an active and intelligent helper during the great\r\nportion of his participation, and as an annuitant and perhaps, if he has\r\ndevised economies and improvements, a receiver of royalties during his\r\ndeclining years.\r\n\r\nAnd concurrently with the systematic reconstruction of a large portion\r\nof our industries upon these lines there will have to be a vigorous\r\ndevelopment of the attempts that are already being made, in garden\r\ncities, garden suburbs, and the like, to re-house the mass of our\r\npopulation in a more civilised and more agreeable manner. Probably that\r\nis not going to pay from the point of view of the money-making business\r\nman, but we prosperous people have to understand that there are things\r\nmore important and more profitable than money-making, and we have to tax\r\nourselves not merely in money, but in time, care, and effort in the\r\nmatter. Half the money that goes out of England to Switzerland and the\r\nRiviera ought to go to the extremely amusing business of clearing up\r\nugly corners and building jolly and convenient workmen's cottages--even\r\nif we do it at a loss. It is part of our discharge for the leisure and\r\nadvantages the system has given us, part of that just give and take,\r\nover and above the solicitor's and bargain-hunter's and money-lender's\r\nconception of justice, upon which social order ultimately rests. We have\r\nto do it not in a mood of patronage, but in a mood of attentive\r\nsolicitude. If not on high grounds, then on low grounds our class has to\r\nset to work and make those other classes more interested and comfortable\r\nand contented. It is what we are for. It is quite impossible for workmen\r\nand poor people generally to plan estates and arrange their own homes;\r\nthey are entirely at the mercy of the wealthy in this matter. There is\r\nnot a slum, not a hovel, not an eyesore upon the English landscape for\r\nwhich some well-off owner is not ultimately to be blamed or excused, and\r\nthe less we leave of such things about the better for us in that day of\r\nreckoning between class and class which now draws so near.\r\n\r\nIt is as plain now as the way from Calais to Paris that if the owning\r\nclass does not attend to these amenities the mass of the people, doing\r\nits best to manage the thing through the politicians, presently will.\r\nThey may make a frightful mess of it, but that will never bring back\r\nthings again into the hands that hold them and neglect them. Their time\r\nwill have passed for ever.\r\n\r\nBut these are the mere opening requirements of this hope of mine of a\r\nquickened social consciousness among the more fortunate and leisurely\r\nsection of the community I believe that much profounder changes in the\r\nconditions of labour are possible than those I have suggested I am\r\nbeginning to suspect that scarcely any of our preconceptions about the\r\nway work must be done, about the hours of work and the habits of work,\r\nwill stand an exhaustive scientific analysis. It is at least conceivable\r\nthat we could get much of the work that has to be done to keep our\r\ncommunity going in far more toil-saving and life-saving ways than we\r\nfollow at the present time. So far scientific men have done scarcely\r\nanything to estimate under what conditions a man works best, does most\r\nwork, works more happily. Suppose it turns out to be the case that a man\r\nalways following one occupation throughout his lifetime, working\r\nregularly day after day for so many hours, as most wage-earners do at\r\nthe present time, does not do nearly so much or nearly so well as he\r\nwould do if he followed first one occupation and then another, or if he\r\nworked as hard as he possibly could for a definite period and then took\r\nholiday? I suspect very strongly, indeed I am convinced, that in certain\r\noccupations, teaching, for example, or surgery, a man begins by working\r\nclumsily and awkwardly, that his interest and skill rise rapidly, that\r\nif he is really well suited in his profession he may presently become\r\nintensely interested and capable of enormous quantities of his very best\r\nwork, and that then his interest and vigour rapidly decline I am\r\ndisposed to believe that this is true of most occupations, of\r\ncoal-mining or engineering, or brick-laying or cotton-spinning. The\r\nthing has never been properly thought about. Our civilisation has grown\r\nup in a haphazard kind of way, and it has been convenient to specialise\r\nworkers and employ them piecemeal. But if it is true that in respect of\r\nany occupation a man has his period of maximum efficiency, then we open\r\nup a whole world of new social possibilities. What we really want from a\r\nman for our social welfare in that case is not regular continuing work,\r\nbut a few strenuous years of high-pressure service. We can as a\r\ncommunity afford to keep him longer at education and training before he\r\nbegins, and we can release him with a pension while he is still full of\r\nlife and the capacity for enjoying freedom. But obviously this is\r\nimpossible upon any basis of weekly wages and intermittent employment;\r\nwe must be handling affairs in some much more comprehensive way than\r\nthat before we can take and deal with the working life of a man as one\r\ncomplete whole.\r\n\r\nThat is one possibility that is frequently in my thoughts about the\r\npresent labour crisis. There is another, and that is the great\r\ndesirability of every class in the community having a practical\r\nknowledge of what labour means. There is a vast amount of work which\r\neither is now or is likely to be in the future within the domain of the\r\npublic administration--road-making, mining, railway work, post-office\r\nand telephone work, medical work, nursing, a considerable amount of\r\nbuilding for example. Why should we employ people to do the bulk of\r\nthese things at all? Why should we not as a community do them ourselves?\r\nWhy, in other words, should we not have a labour conscription and take a\r\nyear or so of service from everyone in the community, high or low? I\r\nbelieve this would be of enormous moral benefit to our strained and\r\nrelaxed community. I believe that in making labour a part of everyone's\r\nlife and the whole of nobody's life lies the ultimate solution of these\r\nindustrial difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 5\r\n\r\nIt is almost a national boast that we \"muddle through\" our troubles, and\r\nI suppose it is true and to our credit that by virtue of a certain\r\nkindliness of temper, a humorous willingness to make the best of things,\r\nand an entirely amiable forgetfulness, we do come out of pressures and\r\nextremities that would smash a harder, more brittle people only a little\r\nchipped and damaged. And it is quite conceivable that our country will,\r\nin a measure, survive the enormous stresses of labour adjustment that\r\nare now upon us, even if it never rises to any heroic struggle against\r\nthese difficulties. But it may survive as a lesser country, as an\r\nimpoverished and second-rate country. It will certainly do no more than\r\nthat, if in any part of the world there is to be found a people capable\r\nof taking up this gigantic question in a greater spirit. Perhaps there\r\nis no such people, and the conflicts and muddles before us will be\r\nworld-wide. Or suppose that it falls to our country in some strange way\r\nto develop a new courage and enterprise, and to be the first to go\r\nforward into this new phase of civilisation I foresee, from which a\r\ndistinctive labouring class, a class that is of expropriated\r\nwage-earners, will have almost completely disappeared.\r\n\r\nNow hitherto the utmost that any State, overtaken by social and economic\r\nstresses, has ever achieved in the way of adapting itself to them has\r\nbeen no more than patching.\r\n\r\nIndividuals and groups and trades have found themselves in imperfectly\r\napprehended and difficult times, and have reluctantly altered their ways\r\nand ideas piecemeal under pressure. Sometimes they have succeeded in\r\nrubbing along upon the new lines, and sometimes the struggle has\r\nsubmerged them, but no community has ever yet had the will and the\r\nimagination to recast and radically alter its social methods as a whole.\r\nThe idea of such a reconstruction has never been absent from human\r\nthought since the days of Plato, and it has been enormously reinforced\r\nby the spreading material successes of modern science, successes due\r\nalways to the substitution of analysis and reasoned planning for trial\r\nand the rule of thumb. But it has never yet been so believed in and\r\nunderstood as to render any real endeavour to reconstruct possible. The\r\nexperiment has always been altogether too gigantic for the available\r\nfaith behind it, and there have been against it the fear of presumption,\r\nthe interests of all advantaged people, and the natural sloth of\r\nhumanity. We do but emerge now from a period of deliberate\r\nhappy-go-lucky and the influence of Herbert Spencer, who came near\r\nraising public shiftlessness to the dignity of a national philosophy.\r\nEverything would adjust itself--if only it was left alone.\r\n\r\nYet some things there are that cannot be done by small adjustments, such\r\nas leaping chasms or killing an ox or escaping from the roof of a\r\nburning house. You have to decide upon a certain course on such\r\noccasions and maintain a continuous movement. If you wait on the burning\r\nhouse until you scorch and then turn round a bit or move away a yard or\r\nso, or if on the verge of a chasm you move a little in the way in which\r\nyou wish to go, disaster will punish your moderation. And it seems to\r\nme that the establishment of the world's work upon a new basis--and that\r\nand no less is what this Labour Unrest demands for its pacification--is\r\njust one of those large alterations which will never be made by the\r\ncollectively unconscious activities of men, by competitions and survival\r\nand the higgling of the market. Humanity is rebelling against the\r\ncontinuing existence of a labour class as such, and I can see no way by\r\nwhich our present method of weekly wages employment can change by\r\nimperceptible increments into a method of salary and pension--for it is\r\nquite evident that only by reaching that shall we reach the end of these\r\npresent discontents. The change has to be made on a comprehensive scale\r\nor not at all. We need nothing less than a national plan of social\r\ndevelopment if the thing is to be achieved.\r\n\r\nNow that, I admit, is, as the Americans say, a large proposition. But we\r\nare living in a time of more and more comprehensive plans, and the mere\r\nfact that no scheme so extensive has ever been tried before is no reason\r\nat all why we should not consider one. We think nowadays quite serenely\r\nof schemes for the treatment of the nation's health as one whole, where\r\nour fathers considered illness as a blend of accident with special\r\nprovidences; we have systematised the community's water supply,\r\neducation, and all sorts of once chaotic services, and Germany and our\r\nown infinite higgledy-piggledy discomfort and ugliness have brought home\r\nto us at last even the possibility of planning the extension of our\r\ntowns and cities. It is only another step upward in scale to plan out\r\nnew, more tolerable conditions of employment for every sort of worker\r\nand to organise the transition from our present disorder.\r\n\r\nThe essential difficulty between the employer and the statesman in the\r\nconsideration of this problem is the difference in the scope of their\r\nview. The employer's concern with the man who does his work is day-long\r\nor week-long; the statesman's is life-long. The conditions of private\r\nenterprise and modern competition oblige the employer to think only of\r\nthe worker as a hand, who appears and does his work and draws his wages\r\nand vanishes again. Only such strikes as we have had during the past\r\nyear will rouse him from that attitude of mind. The statesman at the\r\nother extremity has to consider the worker as a being with a beginning,\r\na middle, an end--and offspring. He can consider all these possibilities\r\nof deferring employment and making the toil of one period of life\r\nprovide for the leisure and freedom of another, which are necessarily\r\nentirely out of the purview of an employer pure and simple. And I find\r\nit hard to see how we can reconcile the intermittency of competitive\r\nemployment with the unremitting demands of a civilised life except by\r\nthe intervention of the State or of some public organisation capable of\r\ntaking very wide views between the business organiser on the one hand\r\nand the subordinate worker on the other. On the one hand we need some\r\nbroader handling of business than is possible in the private adventure\r\nof the solitary proprietor or the single company, and on the other some\r\nmore completely organised development of the collective bargain. We have\r\nto bring the directive intelligence of a concern into an organic\r\nrelation with the conception of the national output as a whole, and\r\neither through a trade union or a guild, or some expansion of a trade\r\nunion, we have to arrange a secure, continuous income for the worker, to\r\nbe received not directly as wages from an employer but intermediately\r\nthrough the organisation. We need a census of our national production, a\r\nmore exhaustive estimate of our resources, and an entirely more\r\nscientific knowledge of the conditions of maximum labour efficiency. One\r\nturns to the State.... And it is at this point that the heart of the\r\npatriotic Englishman sinks, because it is our national misfortune that\r\nall the accidents of public life have conspired to retard the\r\ndevelopment of just that body of knowledge, just that scientific breadth\r\nof imagination which is becoming a vital necessity for the welfare of a\r\nmodern civilised community.\r\n\r\nWe are caught short of scientific men just as in the event of a war with\r\nGermany we shall almost certainly be caught short of scientific sailors\r\nand soldiers. You cannot make that sort of thing to order in a crisis.\r\nScientific education--and more particularly the scientific education of\r\nour owning and responsible classes--has been crippled by the bitter\r\njealousy of the classical teachers who dominate our universities, by the\r\nfear and hatred of the Established Church, which still so largely\r\ncontrols our upper-class schools, and by the entire lack of\r\nunderstanding and support on the part of those able barristers and\r\nfinanciers who rule our political life. Science has been left more and\r\nmore to men of modest origin and narrow outlook, and now we are\r\nbeginning to pay in internal dissensions, and presently we may have to\r\npay in national humiliation for this almost organised rejection of\r\nstimulus and power.\r\n\r\nBut however thwarted and crippled our public imagination may be, we have\r\nstill got to do the best we can with this situation; we have to take as\r\ncomprehensive views as we can, and to attempt as comprehensive a method\r\nof handling as our party-ridden State permits. In theory I am a\r\nSocialist, and were I theorising about some nation in the air I would\r\nsay that all the great productive activities and all the means of\r\ncommunication should be national concerns and be run as national\r\nservices. But our State is peculiarly incapable of such functions; at\r\nthe present time it cannot even produce a postage stamp that will stick;\r\nand the type of official it would probably evolve for industrial\r\norganisation, slowly but unsurely, would be a maddening combination of\r\nthe district visitor and the boy clerk. It is to the independent people\r\nof some leisure and resource in the community that one has at last to\r\nappeal for such large efforts and understandings as our present\r\nsituation demands. In the default of our public services, there opens an\r\nimmense opportunity for voluntary effort. Deference to our official\r\nleaders is absurd; it is a time when men must, as the phrase goes, \"come\r\nforward.\"\r\n\r\nWe want a National Plan for our social and economic development which\r\neveryone may understand and which will serve as a unifying basis for all\r\nour social and political activities. Such a plan is not to be flung out\r\nhastily by an irresponsible writer. It can only come into existence as\r\nthe outcome of a wide movement of inquiry and discussion. My business in\r\nthese pages has been not prescription but diagnosis. I hold it to be the\r\nclear duty of every intelligent person in the country to do his utmost\r\nto learn about these questions of economic and social organisation and\r\nto work them out to conclusions and a purpose. We have come to a phase\r\nin our affairs when the only alternative to a great, deliberate\r\nrenascence of will and understanding is national disorder and decay.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 6\r\n\r\nI have attempted a diagnosis of this aspect of our national situation. I\r\nhave pointed out that nearly all the social forces of our time seem to\r\nbe in conspiracy to bring about the disappearance of a labour class as\r\nsuch and the rearrangement of our work and industry upon a new basis.\r\nThat rearrangement demands an unprecedented national effort and the\r\nproduction of an adequate National Plan. Failing that, we seem doomed to\r\na period of chronic social conflict and possibly even of frankly\r\nrevolutionary outbreaks that may destroy us altogether or leave us only\r\na dwarfed and enfeebled nation....\r\n\r\nAnd before we can develop that National Plan and the effective\r\nrealisation of such a plan that is needed to save us from that fate, two\r\nthings stand immediately before us to be done, unavoidable preliminaries\r\nto that more comprehensive work. The first of these is the restoration\r\nof representative government, and the second a renascence of our public\r\nthought about political and social things.\r\n\r\nAs I have already suggested, a main factor in our present national\r\ninability to deal with this profound and increasing social disturbance\r\nis the entirely unrepresentative and unbusinesslike nature of our\r\nparliamentary government.\r\n\r\nIt is to a quite extraordinary extent a thing apart from our national\r\nlife. It becomes more and more so. To go into the House of Commons is to\r\ngo aside out of the general stream of the community's vitality into a\r\ncorner where little is learnt and much is concocted, into a specialised\r\nAssembly which is at once inattentive to and monstrously influential in\r\nour affairs. There was a period when the debates in the House of Commons\r\nwere an integral, almost a dominant, part of our national thought, when\r\nits speeches were read over in tens of thousands of homes, and a large\r\nand sympathetic public followed the details of every contested issue.\r\nNow a newspaper that dared to fill its columns mainly with parliamentary\r\ndebates, with a full report of the trivialities the academic points, the\r\nlittle familiar jokes, and entirely insincere pleadings which occupy\r\nthat gathering would court bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nThis diminishing actuality of our political life is a matter of almost\r\nuniversal comment to-day. But it is extraordinary how much of that\r\ncomment is made in a tone of hopeless dissatisfaction, how rarely it is\r\nassociated with any will to change a state of affairs that so largely\r\nstultifies our national purpose. And yet the causes of our present\r\npolitical ineptitude are fairly manifest, and a radical and effective\r\nreconstruction is well within the wit of man.\r\n\r\nAll causes and all effects in our complex modern State are complex, but\r\nin this particular matter there can be little doubt that the key to the\r\ndifficulty lies in the crudity and simplicity of our method of election,\r\na method which reduces our apparent free choice of rulers to a\r\nridiculous selection between undesirable alternatives, and hands our\r\nwhole public life over to the specialised manipulator. Our House of\r\nCommons could scarcely misrepresent us more if it was appointed\r\nhaphazard by the Lord Chamberlain or selected by lot from among the\r\ninhabitants of Netting Hill. Election of representatives in one-member\r\nlocal constituencies by a single vote gives a citizen practically no\r\nchoice beyond the candidates appointed by the two great party\r\norganisations in the State. It is an electoral system that forbids\r\nabsolutely any vote splitting or any indication of shades of opinion.\r\nThe presence of more than two candidates introduces an altogether\r\nunmanageable complication, and the voter is at once reduced to voting\r\nnot to secure the return of the perhaps less hopeful candidate he likes,\r\nbut to ensure the rejection of the candidate he most dislikes. So the\r\nnimble wire-puller slips in. In Great Britain we do not have Elections\r\nany more; we have Rejections. What really happens at a general election\r\nis that the party organisations--obscure and secretive conclaves with\r\nentirely mysterious funds--appoint about 1,200 men to be our rulers, and\r\nall that we, we so-called self-governing people, are permitted to do is,\r\nin a muddled, angry way, to strike off the names of about half of these\r\nselected gentlemen.\r\n\r\nTake almost any member of the present Government and consider his case.\r\nYou may credit him with a lifelong industrious intention to get there,\r\nbut ask yourself what is this man's distinction, and for what great\r\nthing in our national life does he stand? By the complaisance of our\r\nparty machinery he was able to present himself to a perplexed\r\nconstituency as the only possible alternative to Conservatism and Tariff\r\nReform, and so we have him. And so we have most of his colleagues.\r\n\r\nNow such a system of representation is surely a system to be destroyed\r\nat any cost, because it stifles our national discussion and thwarts our\r\nnational will. And we can leave no possible method of alteration\r\nuntried. It is not rational that a great people should be baffled by the\r\nmere mechanical degeneration of an electoral method too crudely\r\nconceived. There exist alternatives, and to these alternatives we must\r\nresort. Since John Stuart Mill first called attention to the importance\r\nof the matter there has been a systematic study of the possible working\r\nof electoral methods, and it is now fairly proved that in proportional\r\nrepresentation, with large constituencies returning each many members,\r\nthere is to be found a way of escape from this disastrous embarrassment\r\nof our public business by the party wire-puller and the party nominee.\r\n\r\nI will not dwell upon the particulars of the proportional representation\r\nsystem here. There exists an active society which has organised the\r\neducation of the public in the details of the proposal. Suffice it that\r\nit does give a method by which a voter may vote with confidence for the\r\nparticular man he prefers, with no fear whatever that his vote will be\r\nwasted in the event of that man's chance being hopeless. There is a\r\nmethod by which the order of the voter's subsequent preference is\r\neffectively indicated. That is all, but see how completely it modifies\r\nthe nature of an election. Instead of a hampered choice between two, you\r\nhave a free choice between many. Such a change means a complete\r\nalteration in the quality of public life.\r\n\r\nThe present immense advantage of the party nominee--which is the root\r\ncause, which is almost the sole cause of all our present political\r\nineptitude--would disappear. He would be quite unable to oust any\r\nwell-known and representative independent candidate who chose to stand\r\nagainst him. There would be an immediate alteration in type in the House\r\nof Commons. In the place of these specialists in political getting-on\r\nthere would be few men who had not already gained some intellectual and\r\nmoral hold upon the community; they would already be outstanding and\r\ndistinguished men before they came to the work of government. Great\r\nsections of our national life, science, art, literature, education,\r\nengineering, manufacture would cease to be under-represented, or\r\nmisrepresented by the energetic barrister and political specialist, and\r\nour Legislature would begin to serve, as we have now such urgent need of\r\nits serving, as the means and instrument of that national conference\r\nupon the social outlook of which we stand in need.\r\n\r\nAnd it is to the need and nature of that Conference that I would devote\r\nmyself. I do not mean by the word Conference any gathering of dull and\r\nformal and inattentive people in this dusty hall or that, with a jaded\r\naudience and intermittently active reporters, such as this word may\r\nconjure up to some imaginations. I mean an earnest direction of\r\nattention in all parts of the country to this necessity for a studied\r\nand elaborated project of conciliation and social co-operation We cannot\r\nafford to leave such things to specialised politicians and\r\nself-appointed, self-seeking \"experts\" any longer. A modern community\r\nhas to think out its problems as a whole and co-operate as a whole in\r\ntheir solution. We have to bring all our national life into this\r\ndiscussion of the National Plan before us, and not simply newspapers and\r\nperiodicals and books, but pulpit and college and school have to bear\r\ntheir part in it. And in that particular I would appeal to the schools,\r\nbecause there more than anywhere else is the permanent quickening of our\r\nnational imagination to be achieved.\r\n\r\nWe want to have our young people filled with a new realisation that\r\nHistory is not over, that nothing is settled, and that the supreme\r\ndramatic phase in the story of England has still to come. It was not in\r\nthe Norman Conquest, not in the flight of King James II, nor the\r\noverthrow of Napoleon; it is here and now. It falls to them to be actors\r\nnot in a reminiscent pageant but a living conflict, and the sooner they\r\nare prepared to take their part in that the better our Empire will\r\nacquit itself. How absurd is the preoccupation of our schools and\r\ncolleges with the little provincialisms of our past history before A.D.\r\n1800! \"No current politics,\" whispers the schoolmaster, \"no\r\nreligion--except the coldest formalities _Some parent might object_.\"\r\nAnd he pours into our country every year a fresh supply of gentlemanly\r\ncricketing youths, gapingly unprepared--unless they have picked up a\r\nbroad generalisation or so from some surreptitious Socialist\r\npamphlet--for the immense issues they must control, and that are\r\naltogether uncontrollable if they fail to control them. The universities\r\ndo scarcely more for our young men. All this has to be altered, and\r\naltered vigorously and soon, if our country is to accomplish its\r\ndestinies. Our schools and colleges exist for no other purpose than to\r\ngive our youths a vision of the world and of their duties and\r\npossibilities in the world. We can no longer afford to have them the\r\nlast preserves of an elderly orthodoxy and the last repository of a\r\ndecaying gift of superseded tongues. They are needed too urgently to\r\nmake our leaders leader-like and to sustain the active understandings of\r\nthe race.\r\n\r\nAnd from the labour class itself we are also justified in demanding a\r\nfar more effectual contribution to the National Conference than it is\r\nmaking at the present time. Mere eloquent apologies for distrust, mere\r\ndenunciations of Capitalism and appeals for a Socialism as featureless\r\nas smoke, are unsatisfactory when one regards them as the entire\r\ncontribution of the ascendant worker to the discussion of the national\r\nfuture. The labour thinker has to become definite in his demands and\r\nclearer upon the give and take that will be necessary before they can be\r\nsatisfied. He has to realise rather more generously than he has done so\r\nfar the enormous moral difficulty there is in bringing people who have\r\nbeen prosperous and at an advantage all their lives to the pitch of even\r\ncontemplating a social reorganisation that may minimise or destroy their\r\nprecedence. We have all to think, to think hard and think generously,\r\nand there is not a man in England to-day, even though his hands are busy\r\nat work, whose brain may not be helping in this great task of social\r\nrearrangement which lies before us all.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIAL PANACEAS\r\n\r\n(_June, 1912_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo have followed the frequent discussions of the Labour Unrest in the\r\nPress is to have learnt quite a lot about the methods of popular\r\nthought. And among other things I see now much better than I did why\r\npatent medicines are so popular. It is clear that as a community we are\r\nfar too impatient of detail and complexity, we want overmuch to\r\nsimplify, we clamour for panaceas, we are a collective invitation to\r\nquacks.\r\n\r\nOur situation is an intricate one, it does not admit of a solution\r\nneatly done up in a word or a phrase. Yet so powerful is this wish to\r\nsimplify that it is difficult to make it clear that one is not oneself a\r\npanacea-monger. One writes and people read a little inattentively and\r\nmore than a little impatiently, until one makes a positive proposal\r\nThen they jump. \"So _that's_ your Remedy!\" they say. \"How absurdly\r\ninadequate!\" I was privileged to take part in one such discussion in\r\n1912, and among other things in my diagnosis of the situation I pointed\r\nout the extreme mischief done to our public life by the futility of our\r\nelectoral methods. They make our whole public life forensic and\r\nineffectual, and I pointed out that this evil effect, which vitiates our\r\nwhole national life, could be largely remedied by an infinitely better\r\nvoting system known as Proportional Representation. Thereupon the\r\n_Westminster Gazette_ declared in tones of pity and contempt that it was\r\nno Remedy--and dismissed me. It would be as intelligent to charge a\r\ndoctor who pushed back the crowd about a broken-legged man in the street\r\nwith wanting to heal the limb by giving the sufferer air.\r\n\r\nThe task before our community, the task of reorganising labour on a\r\nbasis broader than that of employment for daily or weekly wages, is one\r\nof huge complexity, and it is as entirely reasonable as it is entirely\r\npreliminary to clean and modernise to the utmost our representative and\r\nlegislative machinery.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how dominant is this disposition to get a phrase, a\r\nword, a simple recipe, for an undertaking so vast in reality that for\r\nall the rest of our lives a large part of the activities of us, forty\r\nmillion people, will be devoted to its partial accomplishment. In the\r\npresence of very great issues people become impatient and irritated, as\r\nthey would not allow themselves to be irritated by far more limited\r\nproblems. Nobody in his senses expects a panacea for the comparatively\r\nsimple and trivial business of playing chess. Nobody wants to be told\r\nto \"rely wholly upon your pawns,\" or \"never, never move your rook\";\r\nnobody clamours \"give me a third knight and all will be well\"; but that\r\nis exactly what everybody seems to be doing in our present discussion\r\nAnd as another aspect of the same impatience, I note the disposition to\r\nclamour against all sorts of necessary processes in the development of a\r\ncivilisation. For example, I read over and over again of the failure of\r\nrepresentative government, and in nine cases out of ten I find that this\r\namounts to a cry against any sort of representative government. It is\r\nperfectly true that our representative institutions do not work well and\r\nneed a vigorous overhauling, but while I find scarcely any support for\r\nsuch a revision, the air is full of vague dangerous demands for\r\naristocracy, for oligarchy, for autocracy. It is like a man who jumps\r\nout of his automobile because he has burst a tyre, refuses a proffered\r\nStepney, and bawls passionately for anything--for a four-wheeler, or a\r\ndonkey, as long as he can be free from that exploded mechanism. There\r\nare evidently quite a considerable number of people in this country who\r\nwould welcome a tyrant at the present time, a strong, silent, cruel,\r\nimprisoning, executing, melodramatic sort of person, who would somehow\r\nmanage everything while they went on--being silly. I find that form of\r\nimpatience cropping up everywhere. I hear echoes of Mr. Blatchford's\r\n\"Wanted, a Man,\" and we may yet see a General Boulanger prancing in our\r\nstreets. There never was a more foolish cry. It is not a man we want,\r\nbut just exactly as many million men as there are in Great Britain at\r\nthe present time, and it is you, the reader, and I, and the rest of us\r\nwho must together go on with the perennial task of saving the country by\r\n_firstly_, doing our own jobs just as well as ever we can, and\r\n_secondly_--and this is really just as important as firstly--doing our\r\nutmost to grasp our national purpose, doing our utmost, that is, to\r\ndevelop and carry out our National Plan. It is Everyman who must be the\r\nsaviour of the State in a modern community; we cannot shift our share in\r\nthe burthen; and here again, I think, is something that may well be\r\nunderlined and emphasised. At present our \"secondly\" is unduly\r\nsubordinated to our \"firstly\"; our game is better individually than\r\ncollectively; we are like a football team that passes badly, and our\r\nneed is not nearly so much to change the players as to broaden their\r\nstyle. And this brings me, in a spirit entirely antagonistic, up against\r\nMr. Galsworthy's suggestion of an autocratic revolution in the methods\r\nof our public schools.\r\n\r\nBut before I go on to that, let me first notice a still more\r\ncomprehensive cry that has been heard again and again in this\r\ndiscussion, and that is the alleged failure of education generally.\r\nThere is never any remedial suggestion made with this particular outcry;\r\nit is merely a gust of abuse and insult for schools, and more\r\nparticularly board schools, carrying with it a half-hearted implication\r\nthat they should be closed, and then the contribution concludes. Now\r\nthere is no outcry at the present time more unjust or--except for the\r\n\"Wanted, a Man\" clamour--more foolish. No doubt our educational\r\nresources, like most other things, fall far short of perfection, but of\r\nall this imperfection the elementary schools are least imperfect; and I\r\nwould almost go so far as to say that, considering the badness of their\r\nmaterial, the huge, clumsy classes they have to deal with, the poorness\r\nof their directive administration, their bad pay and uncertain outlook,\r\nthe elementary teachers of this country are amazingly efficient. And it\r\nis not simply that they are good under their existing conditions, but\r\nthat this service has been made out of nothing whatever in the course of\r\nscarcely forty years. An educational system to cover an Empire is not a\r\nthing that can be got for the asking, it is not even to be got for the\r\npaying; it has to be grown; and in the beginning it is bound to be thin,\r\nragged, forced, crammy, text-bookish, superficial, and all the rest of\r\nit. As reasonable to complain that the children born last year were\r\nimmature. A little army of teachers does not flash into being at the\r\npassing of an Education Act. Not even an organisation for training those\r\nteachers comes to anything like satisfactory working order for many\r\nyears, without considering the delays and obstructions that have been\r\ncaused by the bickerings and bitterness of the various Christian\r\nChurches. So that it is not the failure of elementary education we have\r\nreally to consider, but the continuance and extension of its already\r\nalmost miraculous results.\r\n\r\nAnd when it comes to the education of the ruling and directing classes,\r\nthere is kindred, if lesser reason, for tempering zeal with patience.\r\nThis upper portion of our educational organisation needs urgently to be\r\nbettered, but it is not to be bettered by trying to find an archangel\r\nwho will better it dictatorially. For the good of our souls there are no\r\nsuch beings to relieve us of our collective responsibility. It is clear\r\nthat appointments in this field need not only far more care and far more\r\ninsistence upon creative power than has been shown in the past, but for\r\nthe rest we have to do with the men we have and the schools we have. We\r\ncannot have an educational purge, if only because we have not the new\r\nmen waiting. Here again the need is not impatience, not revolution, but\r\na sustained and penetrating criticism, a steadfast, continuous urgency\r\ntowards effort and well-planned reconstruction and efficiency.\r\n\r\nAnd as a last example of the present hysterical disposition to scrap\r\nthings before they have been fairly tried is the outcry against\r\nexaminations, which has done so much to take the keenness off the edge\r\nof school work in the last few years. Because a great number of\r\nexaminers chosen haphazard turned out to be negligent and incompetent as\r\nexaminers, because their incapacity created a cynical trade in cramming,\r\na great number of people have come to the conclusion, just as\r\nexaminations are being improved into efficiency, that all examinations\r\nare bad. In particular that excellent method of bringing new blood and\r\nnew energy into the public services and breaking up official gangs and\r\ncliques, the competitive examination system, has been discredited, and\r\nthe wire-puller and the influential person are back again tampering with\r\na steadily increasing proportion of appointments....\r\n\r\nBut I have written enough of this impatience, which is, as it were,\r\nmerely the passion for reconstruction losing its head and defeating its\r\nown ends. There is no hope for us outside ourselves. No violent changes,\r\nno Napoleonic saviours can carry on the task of building the Great\r\nState, the civilised State that rises out of our disorders That is for\r\nus to do, all of us and each one of us. We have to think clearly, and\r\nstudy and consider and reconsider our ideas about public things to the\r\nvery utmost of our possibilities. We have to clarify our views and\r\nexpress them and do all we can to stir up thinking and effort in those\r\nabout us.\r\n\r\nI know it would be more agreeable for all of us if we could have some\r\nsmall pill-like remedy for all the troubles of the State, and take it\r\nand go on just as we are going now. But, indeed, to say a word for that\r\nidea would be a treason. We are the State, and there is no other way to\r\nmake it better than to give it the service of our lives. Just in the\r\nmeasure of the aggregate of our devotions and the elaborated and\r\ncriticised sanity of our public proceedings will the world mend.\r\n\r\nI gather from a valuable publication called \"Secret Remedies,\" which\r\nanalyses many popular cures, that this hasty passion for simplicity, for\r\njust one thing that will settle the whole trouble, can carry people to a\r\nlevel beyond an undivided trust in something warranted in a bottle. They\r\nare ready to put their faith in what amounts to practically nothing in a\r\nbottle. And just at present, while a number of excellent people of the\r\nmiddle class think that only a \"man\" is wanted and all will be well with\r\nus, there is a considerable wave of hopefulness among the working class\r\nin favour of a weak solution of nothing, which is offered under the\r\nattractive label of Syndicalism. So far I have been able to discuss the\r\npresent labour situation without any use of this empty word, but when\r\none finds it cropping up in every other article on the subject, it\r\nbecomes advisable to point out what Syndicalism is not. And incidentally\r\nit may enable me to make clear what Socialism in the broader sense,\r\nconstructive Socialism, that is to say, is.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNDICALISM OR CITIZENSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Is a railway porter a railway porter first and a man afterwards, or is\r\nhe a man first and incidentally a railway porter?\"\r\n\r\nThat is the issue between this tawdrification of trade unionism which is\r\ncalled Syndicalism, and the ideals of that Great State, that great\r\ncommonweal, towards which the constructive forces in our civilisation\r\ntend. Are we to drift on to a disastrous intensification of our present\r\nspecialisation of labour as labour, or are we to set to work steadfastly\r\nupon a vast social reconstruction which will close this widening breach\r\nand rescue our community from its present dependence upon the reluctant\r\nand presently insurgent toil of a wages-earning proletariat? Regarded as\r\na project of social development, Syndicalism is ridiculous; regarded as\r\nan illuminating and unintentionally ironical complement to the implicit\r\ntheories of our present social order, it is worthy of close attention.\r\nThe dream of the Syndicalist is an impossible social fragmentation. The\r\ntransport service is to be a democratic republic, the mines are to be a\r\ndemocratic republic, every great industry is to be a democratic republic\r\nwithin the State; our community is to become a conflict of inter-woven\r\ngovernments of workers, incapable of progressive changes of method or of\r\nextension or transmutation of function, the whole being of a man is to\r\nlie within his industrial specialisation, and, upon lines of causation\r\nnot made clear, wages are to go on rising and hours of work are to go on\r\nfalling.... There the mind halts, blinded by the too dazzling vistas of\r\nan unimaginative millennium And the way to this, one gathers, is by\r\nstriking--persistent, destructive striking--until it comes about.\r\n\r\nSuch is Syndicalism, the cheap Labour Panacea, to which the more\r\npassionate and less intelligent portion of the younger workers,\r\nimpatient of the large constructive developments of modern Socialism,\r\ndrifts steadily. It is the direct and logical reaction to our present\r\neconomic system, which has counted our workers neither as souls nor as\r\nheads, but as hands. They are beginning to accept the suggestions of\r\nthat method. It is the culmination in aggression of that, at first,\r\nentirely protective trade unionism which the individual selfishness and\r\ncollective short-sightedness and State blindness of our owning and\r\ndirecting and ruling classes forced upon the working man. At first trade\r\nunionism was essentially defensive; it was the only possible defence of\r\nthe workers, who were being steadily pressed over the margin of\r\nsubsistence. It was a nearly involuntary resistance to class debasement.\r\nMr. Vernon Hartshorn has expressed it as that in a recent article. But\r\nhis paper, if one read it from beginning to end, displayed, compactly\r\nand completely, the unavoidable psychological development of the\r\nspecialised labour case. He began in the mildest tones with those now\r\nrespectable words, a \"guaranteed minimum\" of wages, housing, and so\r\nforth, and ended with a very clear intimation of an all-labour\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nIf anything is certain in this world, it is that the mass of the\r\ncommunity will not rest satisfied with these guaranteed minima. All\r\nthose possible legislative increments in the general standard of living\r\nare not going to diminish the labour unrest; they are going to increase\r\nit. A starving man may think he wants nothing in the world but bread,\r\nbut when he has eaten you will find he wants all sorts of things beyond.\r\nMr. Hartshorn assures us that the worker is \"not out for a theory.\" So\r\nmuch the worse for the worker and all of us when, like the mere hand we\r\nhave made him, he shows himself unable to define or even forecast his\r\nultimate intentions. He will in that case merely clutch. And the obvious\r\nimmediate next objective of that clutch directly its imagination passes\r\nbeyond the \"guaranteed minima\" phase is the industry as a whole.\r\n\r\nI do not see how anyone who desires the continuing development of\r\ncivilisation can regard a trade union as anything but a necessary evil,\r\na pressure-relieving contrivance an arresting and delaying organisation\r\nbegotten by just that class separation of labour which in the commonweal\r\nof the Great State will be altogether destroyed. It leads nowhither; it\r\nis a shelter hut on the road. The wider movement of modern civilisation\r\nis against class organisation and caste feeling. These are forces\r\nantagonistic to progress, continually springing up and endeavouring to\r\nstereotype the transitory organisation, and continually being defeated.\r\n\r\nOf all the solemn imbecilities one hears, surely the most foolish is\r\nthis, that we are in \"an age of specialisation.\" The comparative\r\nfruitfulness and hopefulness of our social order, in comparison with any\r\nother social system, lies in its flat contradiction of that absurdity.\r\nOur medical and surgical advances, for example, are almost entirely due\r\nto the invasion of medical research by the chemist; our naval\r\ndevelopment to the supersession of the sailor by the engineer; we sweep\r\naway the coachman with the railway, beat the suburban line with the\r\nelectric tramway, and attack that again with the petrol omnibus, oust\r\nbrick and stonework in substantial fabrics by steel frames, replace the\r\nskilled maker of woodcuts by a photographer, and so on through the\r\nwhole range of our activities. Change of function, arrest of\r\nspecialisation by innovations in method and appliance, progress by the\r\ninfringement of professional boundaries and the defiance of rule: these\r\nare the commonplaces of our time. The trained man, the specialised man,\r\nis the most unfortunate of men; the world leaves him behind, and he has\r\nlost his power of overtaking it. Versatility, alert adaptability, these\r\nare our urgent needs. In peace and war alike the unimaginative,\r\nuninventive man is a burthen and a retardation, as he never was before\r\nin the world's history. The modern community, therefore, that succeeds\r\nmost rapidly and most completely in converting both its labourers and\r\nits leisure class into a population of active, able, unhurried,\r\neducated, and physically well-developed people will be inevitably the\r\ndominant community in the world. That lies on the face of things about\r\nus; a man who cannot see that must be blind to the traffic in our\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nSyndicalism is not a plan of social development. It is a spirit of\r\nconflict. That conflict lies ahead of us, the open war of strikes,\r\nor--if the forces of law and order crush that down--then sabotage and\r\nthat black revolt of the human spirit into crime which we speak of\r\nnowadays as anarchism, unless we can discover a broad and promising way\r\nfrom the present condition of things to nothing less than the complete\r\nabolition of the labour class.\r\n\r\nThat, I know, sounds a vast proposal, but this is a gigantic business\r\naltogether, and we can do nothing with it unless we are prepared to deal\r\nwith large ideas. If St. Paul's begins to totter it is no good propping\r\nit up with half a dozen walking-sticks, and small palliatives have no\r\nlegitimate place at all in this discussion. Our generation has to take\r\nup this tremendous necessity of a social reconstruction in a great way;\r\nits broad lines have to be thought out by thousands of minds, and it is\r\nfor that reason that I have put the stress upon our need of discussion,\r\nof a wide intellectual and moral stimulation of a stirring up in our\r\nschools and pulpits, and upon the modernisation and clarification of\r\nwhat should be the deliberative assembly of the nation.\r\n\r\nIt would be presumptuous to anticipate the National Plan that must\r\nemerge from so vast a debate, but certain conclusions I feel in my bones\r\nwill stand the test of an exhaustive criticism. The first is that a\r\ndistinction will be drawn between what I would call \"interesting work\"\r\nand what I would call \"mere labour.\" The two things, I admit, pass by\r\ninsensible gradations into one another, but while on the one hand such\r\nwork as being a master gardener and growing roses, or a master cabinet\r\nmaker and making fine pieces, or an artist of almost any sort, or a\r\nstory writer, or a consulting physician, or a scientific investigator,\r\nor a keeper of wild animals, or a forester, or a librarian, or a good\r\nprinter, or many sorts of engineer, is work that will always find men of\r\na certain temperament enthusiastically glad to do it, if they can only\r\ndo it for comfortable pay--for such work is in itself _living_--there\r\nis, on the other hand, work so irksome and toilsome, such as coal\r\nmining, or being a private soldier during a peace, or attending upon\r\nlunatics, or stoking, or doing over and over again, almost mechanically,\r\nlittle bits of a modern industrial process, or being a cash desk clerk\r\nin a busy shop, that few people would undertake if they could avoid it.\r\n\r\nAnd the whole strength of our collective intelligence will be directed\r\nfirst to reducing the amount of such irksome work by labour-saving\r\nmachinery, by ingenuity of management, and by the systematic avoidance\r\nof giving trouble as a duty, and then to so distributing the residuum of\r\nit that it will become the whole life of no class whatever in our\r\npopulation. I have already quoted the idea of Professor William James of\r\na universal conscription for such irksome labour, and while he would\r\nhave instituted that mainly for its immense moral effect upon the\r\ncommunity, I would point out that, combined with a nationalisation of\r\ntransport, mining, and so forth, it is also a way to a partial solution\r\nof this difficulty of \"mere toil.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the mention of a compulsory period of labour service for everyone--a\r\nyear or so with the pickaxe as well as with the rifle--leads me to\r\nanother idea that I believe will stand the test of unlimited criticism,\r\nand that is a total condemnation of all these eight-hour-a-day,\r\nearly-closing, guaranteed-weekly-half-holiday notions that are now so\r\nprevalent in Liberal circles. Under existing conditions, in our system\r\nof private enterprise and competition, these restrictions are no doubt\r\nnecessary to save a large portion of our population from lives of\r\ncontinuous toil, but, like trade unionism, they are a necessity of our\r\npresent conditions, and not a way to a better social state. If we rescue\r\nourselves as a community from poverty and discomfort, we must take care\r\nnot to fling ourselves into something far more infuriating to a normal\r\nhuman being--and that is boredom. The prospect of a carefully inspected\r\nsanitary life, tethered to some light, little, uninteresting daily job,\r\nsix or eight hours of it, seems to me--and I am sure I write here for\r\nmost normal, healthy, active people--more awful than hunger and death.\r\nIt is far more in the quality of the human spirit, and still more what\r\nwe all in our hearts want the human spirit to be, to fling itself with\r\nits utmost power at a job and do it with passion.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, if I was sentenced to hew a thousand tons of coal, I\r\nshould want to get at it at once and work furiously at it, with the\r\nshortest intervals for rest and refreshment and an occasional night\r\nholiday, until I hewed my way out, and if some interfering person with a\r\nbenevolent air wanted to restrict me to hewing five hundredweight, and\r\nno more and no less, each day and every day, I should be strongly\r\ndisposed to go for that benevolent person with my pick. That is surely\r\nwhat every natural man would want to do, and it is only the clumsy\r\nimperfection of our social organisation that will not enable a man to do\r\nhis stint of labour in a few vigorous years and then come up into the\r\nsunlight for good and all.\r\n\r\nIt is along that line that I feel a large part of our labour\r\nreorganisation, over and beyond that conscription, must ultimately go.\r\nThe community as a whole would, I believe, get far more out of a man if\r\nhe had such a comparatively brief passion of toil than if he worked,\r\nwith occasional lapses into unemployment, drearily all his life. But at\r\npresent, with our existing system of employment, one cannot arrange so\r\ncomprehensive a treatment of a man's life. There is needed some State or\r\nquasi-public organisation which shall stand between the man and the\r\nemployer, act as his banker and guarantor, and exact his proper price.\r\nThen, with his toil over, he would have an adequate pension and be free\r\nto do nothing or anything else as he chose. In a Socialistic order of\r\nsociety, where the State would also be largely the employer, such a\r\nmethod would be, of course, far more easily contrived.\r\n\r\nThe more modern statements of Socialism do not contemplate making the\r\nState the sole employer; it is chiefly in transport, mining, fisheries,\r\nforestry, the cultivation of the food staples, and the manufacture of a\r\nfew such articles as bricks and steel, and possibly in housing in what\r\none might call the standardisable industries, that the State is imagined\r\nas the direct owner and employer and it is just in these departments\r\nthat the bulk of the irksome toil is to be found. There remain large\r\nregions of more specialised and individualised production that many\r\nSocialists nowadays are quite prepared to leave to the freer initiatives\r\nof private enterprise. Most of these are occupations involving a greater\r\nelement of interest, less direction and more co-operation, and it is\r\njust here that the success of co-partnery and a sustained life\r\nparticipation becomes possible....\r\n\r\nThis complete civilised system without a specialised, property-less\r\nlabour class is not simply a possibility, it is necessary; the whole\r\nsocial movement of the time, the stars in their courses, war against the\r\npermanence of the present state of affairs. The alternative to this\r\ngigantic effort to rearrange our world is not a continuation of muddling\r\nalong, but social war. The Syndicalist and his folly will be the avenger\r\nof lost opportunities. Not a Labour State do we want, nor a Servile\r\nState, but a powerful Leisure State of free men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT STATE\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1\r\n\r\nFor many years now I have taken a part in the discussion of Socialism.\r\nDuring that time Socialism has become a more and more ambiguous term. It\r\nhas seemed to me desirable to clear up my own ideas of social progress\r\nand the public side of my life by restating them, and this I have\r\nattempted in this essay.\r\n\r\nIn order to do so it has been convenient to coin two expressions, and to\r\nemploy them with a certain defined intention. They are firstly: The\r\nNormal Social Life, and secondly: The Great State. Throughout this essay\r\nthese expressions will be used in accordance with the definitions\r\npresently to be given, and the fact that they are so used will be\r\nemphasised by the employment of capitals. It will be possible for anyone\r\nto argue that what is here defined as the Normal Social Life is not the\r\nnormal social life, and that the Great State is indeed no state at all.\r\nThat will be an argument outside the range delimited by these\r\ndefinitions.\r\n\r\nNow what is intended by the Normal Social Life here is a type of human\r\nassociation and employment, of extreme prevalence and antiquity, which\r\nappears to have been the lot of the enormous majority of human beings as\r\nfar back as history or tradition or the vestiges of material that supply\r\nour conceptions of the neolithic period can carry us. It has never been\r\nthe lot of all humanity at any time, to-day it is perhaps less\r\npredominant than it has ever been, yet even to-day it is probably the\r\nlot of the greater moiety of mankind.\r\n\r\nEssentially this type of association presents a localised community, a\r\ncommunity of which the greater proportion of the individuals are engaged\r\nmore or less directly in the cultivation of the land. With this there is\r\nalso associated the grazing or herding over wider or more restricted\r\nareas, belonging either collectively or discretely to the community, of\r\nsheep, cattle, goats, or swine, and almost always the domestic fowl is\r\ncommensal with man in this life. The cultivated land at least is usually\r\nassigned, temporarily or inalienably, as property to specific\r\nindividuals, and the individuals are grouped in generally monogamic\r\nfamilies of which the father is the head. Essentially the social unit is\r\nthe Family, and even where, as in Mohammedan countries, there is no\r\nlegal or customary restriction upon polygamy, monogamy still prevails as\r\nthe ordinary way of living. Unmarried women are not esteemed, and\r\nchildren are desired. According to the dangers or securities of the\r\nregion, the nature of the cultivation and the temperament of the people,\r\nthis community is scattered either widely in separate steadings or drawn\r\ntogether into villages. At one extreme, over large areas of thin pasture\r\nthis agricultural community may verge on the nomadic; at another, in\r\nproximity to consuming markets, it may present the concentration of\r\nintensive culture. There may be an adjacent Wild supplying wood, and\r\nperhaps controlled by a simple forestry. The law that holds this\r\ncommunity together is largely traditional and customary and almost\r\nalways as its primordial bond there is some sort of temple and some sort\r\nof priest. Typically, the temple is devoted to a local god or a\r\nlocalised saint, and its position indicates the central point of the\r\nlocality, its assembly place and its market. Associated with the\r\nagriculture there are usually a few imperfectly specialised tradesmen, a\r\nsmith, a garment-maker perhaps, a basket-maker or potter, who group\r\nabout the church or temple. The community may maintain itself in a state\r\nof complete isolation, but more usually there are tracks or roads to the\r\ncentres of adjacent communities, and a certain drift of travel, a\r\ncertain trade in non-essential things. In the fundamentals of life this\r\nnormal community is independent and self-subsisting, and where it is not\r\nbeginning to be modified by the novel forces of the new times it\r\nproduces its own food and drink, its own clothing, and largely\r\nintermarries within its limits.\r\n\r\nThis in general terms is what is here intended by the phrase the Normal\r\nSocial Life. It is still the substantial part of the rural life of all\r\nEurope and most Asia and Africa, and it has been the life of the great\r\nmajority of human beings for immemorial years. It is the root life. It\r\nrests upon the soil, and from that soil below and its reaction to the\r\nseasons and the moods of the sky overhead have grown most of the\r\ntraditions, institutions, sentiments, beliefs, superstitions, and\r\nfundamental songs and stories of mankind.\r\n\r\nBut since the very dawn of history at least this Normal Social Life has\r\nnever been the whole complete life of mankind. Quite apart from the\r\nmarginal life of the savage hunter, there have been a number of forces\r\nand influences within men and women and without, that have produced\r\nabnormal and surplus ways of living, supplemental, additional, and even\r\nantagonistic to this normal scheme.\r\n\r\nAnd first as to the forces within men and women. Long as it has lasted,\r\nalmost universal as it has been, the human being has never yet achieved\r\na perfect adaptation to the needs of the Normal Social Life. He has\r\nattained nothing of that frictionless fitting to the needs of\r\nassociation one finds in the bee or the ant. Curiosity, deep stirrings\r\nto wander, the still more ancient inheritance of the hunter, a recurrent\r\ndistaste for labour, and resentment against the necessary subjugations\r\nof family life have always been a straining force within the\r\nagricultural community. The increase of population during periods of\r\nprosperity has led at the touch of bad seasons and adversity to the\r\ndesperate reliefs of war and the invasion of alien localities. And the\r\nnomadic and adventurous spirit of man found reliefs and opportunities\r\nmore particularly along the shores of great rivers and inland seas.\r\nTrade and travel began, at first only a trade in adventitious things, in\r\nmetals and rare objects and luxuries and slaves. With trade came writing\r\nand money; the inventions of debt and rent, usury and tribute. History\r\nfinds already in its beginnings a thin network of trading and slaving\r\nflung over the world of the Normal Social Life, a network whose strands\r\nare the early roads, whose knots are the first towns and the first\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nIndeed, all recorded history is in a sense the history of these surplus\r\nand supplemental activities of mankind. The Normal Social Life flowed on\r\nin its immemorial fashion, using no letters, needing no records, leaving\r\nno history. Then, a little minority, bulking disproportionately in the\r\nrecord, come the trader, the sailor, the slave, the landlord and the\r\ntax-compeller, the townsman and the king.\r\n\r\nAll written history is the story of a minority and their peculiar and\r\nabnormal affairs. Save in so far as it notes great natural catastrophes\r\nand tells of the spreading or retrocession of human life through changes\r\nof climate and physical conditions it resolves itself into an account of\r\na series of attacks and modifications and supplements made by excessive\r\nand superfluous forces engendered within the community upon the Normal\r\nSocial Life. The very invention of writing is a part of those modifying\r\ndevelopments. The Normal Social Life is essentially illiterate and\r\ntraditional. The Normal Social Life is as mute as the standing crops; it\r\nis as seasonal and cyclic as nature herself, and reaches towards the\r\nfuture only an intimation of continual repetitions.\r\n\r\nNow this human over-life may take either beneficent or maleficent or\r\nneutral aspects towards the general life of humanity. It may present\r\nitself as law and pacification, as a positive addition and\r\nsuperstructure to the Normal Social Life, as roads and markets and\r\ncities, as courts and unifying monarchies, as helpful and directing\r\nreligious organisations, as literature and art and science and\r\nphilosophy, reflecting back upon the individual in the Normal Social\r\nLife from which it arose, a gilding and refreshment of new and wider\r\ninterests and added pleasures and resources. One may define certain\r\nphases in the history of various countries when this was the state of\r\naffairs, when a countryside of prosperous communities with a healthy\r\nfamily life and a wide distribution of property, animated by roads and\r\ntowns and unified by a generally intelligible religious belief, lived in\r\na transitory but satisfactory harmony under a sympathetic government. I\r\ntake it that this is the condition to which the minds of such original\r\nand vigorous reactionary thinkers as Mr. G.K. Chesterton and Mr. Hilaire\r\nBelloc for example turn, as being the most desirable state of mankind.\r\n\r\nBut the general effect of history is to present these phases as phases\r\nof exceptional good luck, and to show the surplus forces of humanity as\r\non the whole antagonistic to any such equilibrium with the Normal Social\r\nLife. To open the book of history haphazard is, most commonly, to open\r\nit at a page where the surplus forces appear to be in more or less\r\ndestructive conflict with the Normal Social Life. One opens at the\r\ndepopulation of Italy by the aggressive great estates of the Roman\r\nEmpire, at the impoverishment of the French peasantry by a too\r\ncentralised monarchy before the revolution, or at the huge degenerative\r\ngrowth of the great industrial towns of western Europe in the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Or again one opens at destructive wars. One sees these surplus\r\nforces over and above the Normal Social Life working towards unstable\r\nconcentrations of population, to centralisation of government, to\r\nmigrations and conflicts upon a large scale; one discovers the process\r\ndeveloping into a phase of social fragmentation and destruction and\r\nthen, unless the whole country has been wasted down to its very soil,\r\nthe Normal Social Life returns as the heath and furze and grass return\r\nafter the burning of a common. But it never returns in precisely its old\r\nform. The surplus forces have always produced some traceable change; the\r\nrhythm is a little altered. As between the Gallic peasant before the\r\nRoman conquest, the peasant of the Gallic province, the Carlovingian\r\npeasant, the French peasant of the thirteenth, the seventeenth, and the\r\ntwentieth centuries, there is, in spite of a general uniformity of life,\r\nof a common atmosphere of cows, hens, dung, toil, ploughing, economy,\r\nand domestic intimacy, an effect of accumulating generalising\r\ninfluences and of wider relevancies. And the oscillations of empires and\r\nkingdoms, religious movements, wars, invasions, settlements leave upon\r\nthe mind an impression that the surplus life of mankind, the\r\nless-localised life of mankind, that life of mankind which is not\r\ndirectly connected with the soil but which has become more or less\r\ndetached from and independent of it, is becoming proportionately more\r\nimportant in relation to the Normal Social Life. It is as if a different\r\nway of living was emerging from the Normal Social Life and freeing\r\nitself from its traditions and limitations.\r\n\r\nAnd this is more particularly the effect upon the mind of a review of\r\nthe history of the past two hundred years. The little speculative\r\nactivities of the alchemist and natural philosopher, the little economic\r\nexperiments of the acquisitive and enterprising landed proprietor,\r\nfavoured by unprecedented periods of security and freedom, have passed\r\ninto a new phase of extraordinary productivity. They had added\r\npreposterously and continue to add on a gigantic scale and without any\r\nevident limits to the continuation of their additions, to the resources\r\nof humanity. To the strength of horses and men and slaves has been added\r\nthe power of machines and the possibility of economies that were once\r\nincredible The Normal Social Life has been overshadowed as it has never\r\nbeen overshadowed before by the concentrations and achievements of the\r\nsurplus life. Vast new possibilities open to the race; the traditional\r\nlife of mankind, its traditional systems of association, are challenged\r\nand threatened; and all the social thought, all the political activity\r\nof our time turns in reality upon the conflict of this ancient system\r\nwhose essentials we have here defined and termed the Normal Social Life\r\nwith the still vague and formless impulses that seem destined either to\r\ninvolve it and the race in a final destruction or to replace it by some\r\nnew and probably more elaborate method of human association.\r\n\r\nBecause there is the following difference between the action of the\r\nsurplus forces as we see them to-day and as they appeared before the\r\noutbreak of physical science and mechanism. Then it seemed clearly\r\nnecessary that whatever social and political organisation developed, it\r\nmust needs; rest ultimately on the tiller of the soil, the agricultural\r\nholding, and the Normal Social Life. But now even in agriculture huge\r\nwholesale methods have appeared. They are declared to be destructive;\r\nbut it is quite conceivable that they may be made ultimately as\r\nrecuperative as that small agriculture which has hitherto been the\r\ninevitable social basis. If that is so, then the new ways of living may\r\nnot simply impose themselves in a growing proportion upon the Normal\r\nSocial Life, but they may even oust it and replace it altogether. Or\r\nthey may oust it and fail to replace it. In the newer countries the\r\nNormal Social Life does not appear to establish itself at all rapidly.\r\nNo real peasantry appears in either America or Australia; and in the\r\nolder countries, unless there is the most elaborate legislative and\r\nfiscal protection, the peasant population wanes before the large farm,\r\nthe estate, and overseas production.\r\n\r\nNow most of the political and social discussion of the last hundred\r\nyears may be regarded and rephrased as an attempt to apprehend this\r\ndefensive struggle of the Normal Social Life against waxing novelty and\r\ninnovation and to give a direction and guidance to all of us who\r\nparticipate. And it is very largely a matter of temperament and free\r\nchoice still, just where we shall decide to place ourselves. Let us\r\nconsider some of the key words of contemporary thought, such as\r\nLiberalism, Individualism, Socialism, in the light of this broad\r\ngeneralisation we have made; and then we shall find it easier to explain\r\nour intention in employing as a second technicality the phrase of The\r\nGreat State as an opposite to the Normal Social Life, which we have\r\nalready defined.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2\r\n\r\nThe Normal Social Life has been defined as one based on agriculture,\r\ntraditional and essentially unchanging. It has needed no toleration and\r\ndisplayed no toleration for novelty and strangeness. Its beliefs have\r\nbeen on such a nature as to justify and sustain itself, and it has had\r\nan intrinsic hostility to any other beliefs. The God of its community\r\nhas been a jealous god even when he was only a tribal and local god.\r\nOnly very occasionally in history until the coming of the modern period\r\ndo we find any human community relaxing from this ancient and more\r\nnormal state of entire intolerance towards ideas or practices other than\r\nits own. When toleration and a receptive attitude towards alien ideas\r\nwas manifested in the Old World, it was at some trading centre or\r\npolitical centre; new ideas and new religions came by water along the\r\ntrade routes. And such toleration as there was rarely extended to active\r\nteaching and propaganda. Even in liberal Athens the hemlock was in the\r\nlast resort at the service of the ancient gods and the ancient morals\r\nagainst the sceptical critic.\r\n\r\nBut with the steady development of innovating forces in human affairs\r\nthere has actually grown up a cult of receptivity, a readiness for new\r\nideas, a faith in the probable truth of novelties. Liberalism--I do not,\r\nof course, refer in any way to the political party which makes this\r\nprofession--is essentially anti-traditionalism; its tendency is to\r\ncommit for trial any institution or belief that is brought before it. It\r\nis the accuser and antagonist of all the fixed and ancient values and\r\nimperatives and prohibitions of the Normal Social Life. And growing up\r\nin relation to Liberalism and sustained by it is the great body of\r\nscientific knowledge, which professes at least to be absolutely\r\nundogmatic and perpetually on its trial and under assay and\r\nre-examination.\r\n\r\nNow a very large part of the advanced thought of the past century is no\r\nmore than the confused negation of the broad beliefs and institutions\r\nwhich have been the heritage and social basis of humanity for immemorial\r\nyears. This is as true of the extremest Individualism as of the\r\nextremest Socialism. The former denies that element of legal and\r\ncustomary control which has always subdued the individual to the needs\r\nof the Normal Social Life, and the latter that qualified independence of\r\ndistributed property which is the basis of family autonomy. Both are\r\nmovements against the ancient life, and nothing is more absurd than the\r\nmisrepresentation which presents either as a conservative force. They\r\nare two divergent schools with a common disposition to reject the old\r\nand turn towards the new. The Individualist professes a faith for which\r\nhe has no rational evidence, that the mere abandonment of traditions and\r\ncontrols must ultimately produce a new and beautiful social order; while\r\nthe Socialist, with an equal liberalism, regards the outlook with a\r\nkind of hopeful dread, and insists upon an elaborate readjustment, a new\r\nand untried scheme of social organisation to replace the shattered and\r\nweakening Normal Social Life.\r\n\r\nBoth these movements, and, indeed, all movements that are not movements\r\nfor the subjugation of innovation and the restoration of tradition, are\r\nvague in the prospect they contemplate. They produce no definite\r\nforecasts of the quality of the future towards which they so confidently\r\nindicate the way. But this is less true of modern socialism than of its\r\nantithesis, and it becomes less and less true as socialism, under an\r\nenormous torrent of criticism, slowly washes itself clean from the mass\r\nof partial statement, hasty misstatement, sheer error and presumption\r\nthat obscured its first emergence.\r\n\r\nBut it is well to be very clear upon one point at this stage, and that\r\nis, that this present time is not a battle-ground between individualism\r\nand socialism; it is a battle-ground between the Normal Social Life on\r\nthe one hand and a complex of forces on the other which seek a form of\r\nreplacement and seem partially to find it in these and other doctrines.\r\n\r\nNearly all contemporary thinkers who are not too muddled to be\r\nassignable fall into one of three classes, of which the third we shall\r\ndistinguish is the largest and most various and divergent. It will be\r\nconvenient to say a little of each of these classes before proceeding to\r\na more particular account of the third. Our analysis will cut across\r\nmany accepted classifications, but there will be ample justification for\r\nthis rearrangement. All of them may be dealt with quite justly as\r\naccepting the general account of the historical process which is here\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nThen first we must distinguish a series of writers and thinkers which\r\none may call--the word conservative being already politically\r\nassigned--the Conservators.\r\n\r\nThese are people who really do consider the Normal Social Life as the\r\nonly proper and desirable life for the great mass of humanity, and they\r\nare fully prepared to subordinate all exceptional and surplus lives to\r\nthe moral standards and limitations that arise naturally out of the\r\nNormal Social Life. They desire a state in which property is widely\r\ndistributed, a community of independent families protected by law and an\r\nintelligent democratic statecraft from the economic aggressions of large\r\naccumulations and linked by a common religion. Their attitude to the\r\nforces of change is necessarily a hostile attitude. They are disposed to\r\nregard innovations in transit and machinery as undesirable, and even\r\nmischievous disturbances of a wholesome equilibrium. They are at least\r\nunfriendly to any organisation of scientific research, and scornful of\r\nthe pretensions of science. Criticisms of the methods of logic,\r\nscepticism of the more widely diffused human beliefs, they would\r\nclassify as insanity. Two able English writers, Mr. G.K. Chesterton and\r\nMr. Belloc, have given the clearest expression to this system of ideals,\r\nand stated an admirable case for it. They present a conception of\r\nvinous, loudly singing, earthy, toiling, custom-ruled, wholesome, and\r\ninsanitary men; they are pagan in the sense that their hearts are with\r\nthe villagers and not with the townsmen, Christian in the spirit of the\r\nparish priest. There are no other Conservators so clear-headed and\r\nconsistent. But their teaching is merely the logical expression of an\r\nenormous amount of conservative feeling. Vast multitudes of less lucid\r\nminds share their hostility to novelty and research; hate, dread, and\r\nare eager to despise science, and glow responsive to the warm, familiar\r\nexpressions of primordial feelings and immemorial prejudices The rural\r\nconservative, the liberal of the allotments and small-holdings type, Mr.\r\nRoosevelt--in his Western-farmer, philoprogenitive phase as\r\ndistinguished from the phase of his more imperialist moments--all\r\npresent themselves as essentially Conservators as seekers after and\r\npreservers of the Normal Social Life.\r\n\r\nSo, too, do Socialists of the William Morris type. The mind of William\r\nMorris was profoundly reactionary He hated the whole trend of later\r\nnineteenth-century modernism with the hatred natural to a man of\r\nconsiderable scholarship and intense aesthetic sensibilities. His mind\r\nturned, exactly as Mr. Belloc's turns, to the finished and enriched\r\nNormal Social Life of western Europe in the middle ages, but, unlike Mr.\r\nBelloc, he believed that, given private ownership of land and the\r\nordinary materials of life, there must necessarily be an aggregatory\r\nprocess, usury, expropriation, the development of an exploiting wealthy\r\nclass. He believed profit was the devil. His \"News from Nowhere\"\r\npictures a communism that amounted in fact to little more than a system\r\nof private ownership of farms and trades without money or any buying and\r\nselling, in an atmosphere of geniality, generosity, and mutual\r\nhelpfulness. Mr. Belloc, with a harder grip upon the realities of life,\r\nwould have the widest distribution of proprietorship, with an alert\r\ndemocratic government continually legislating against the protean\r\nreappearances of usury and accumulation and attacking, breaking up, and\r\nredistributing any large unanticipated bodies of wealth that appeared.\r\nBut both men are equally set towards the Normal Social Life, and\r\nequally enemies of the New. The so-called \"socialist\" land legislation\r\nof New Zealand again is a tentative towards the realisation of the same\r\nschool of ideas: great estates are to be automatically broken up,\r\nproperty is to be kept disseminated; a vast amount of political speaking\r\nand writing in America and throughout the world enforces one's\r\nimpression of the widespread influence of Conservator ideals.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is inevitable that phases of prosperity for the Normal\r\nSocial Life will lead to phases of over-population and scarcity, there\r\nwill be occasional famines and occasional pestilences and plethoras of\r\nvitality leading to the blood-letting of war. I suppose Mr. Chesterton\r\nand Mr. Belloc at least have the courage of their opinions, and are\r\nprepared to say that such things always have been and always must be;\r\nthey are part of the jolly rhythms of the human lot under the sun, and\r\nare to be taken with the harvest home and love-making and the peaceful\r\nending of honoured lives as an integral part of the unending drama of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3\r\n\r\nNow opposed to the Conservators are all those who do not regard\r\ncontemporary humanity as a final thing nor the Normal Social Life as the\r\ninevitable basis of human continuity. They believe in secular change, in\r\nProgress, in a future for our species differing continually more from\r\nits past. On the whole, they are prepared for the gradual\r\ndisentanglement of men from the Normal Social Life altogether, and they\r\nlook for new ways of living and new methods of human association with a\r\ncertain adventurous hopefulness.\r\n\r\nNow, this second large class does not so much admit of subdivision into\r\ntwo as present a great variety of intermediaries between two extremes. I\r\npropose to give distinctive names to these extremes, with the very clear\r\nproviso that they are not antagonised, and that the great multitude of\r\nthis second, anti-conservator class, this liberal, more novel class\r\nmodern conditions have produced falls between them, and is neither the\r\none nor the other, but partaking in various degrees of both. On the one\r\nhand, then, we have that type of mind which is irritated by and\r\ndistrustful of all collective proceedings which is profoundly\r\ndistrustful of churches and states, which is expressed essentially by\r\nIndividualism. The Individualist appears to regard the extensive\r\ndisintegrations of the Normal Social Life that are going on to-day with\r\nan extreme hopefulness. Whatever is ugly or harsh in modern\r\nindustrialism or in the novel social development of our time he seems to\r\nconsider as a necessary aspect of a process of selection and survival,\r\nwhose tendencies are on the whole inevitably satisfactory. The future\r\nwelfare of man he believes in effect may be trusted to the spontaneous\r\nand planless activities of people of goodwill, and nothing but state\r\nintervention can effectively impede its attainment. And curiously close\r\nto this extreme optimistic school in its moral quality and logical\r\nconsequences, though contrasting widely in the sinister gloom of its\r\nspirit, is the socialism of Karl Marx. He declared the contemporary\r\nworld to be a great process of financial aggrandisement and general\r\nexpropriation, of increasing power for the few and of increasing\r\nhardship and misery for the many, a process that would go on until at\r\nlast a crisis of unendurable tension would be reached and the social\r\nrevolution ensue. The world had, in fact, to be worse before it could\r\nhope to be better. He contemplated a continually exacerbated Class War,\r\nwith a millennium of extraordinary vagueness beyond as the reward of\r\nthe victorious workers. His common quality with the Individualist lies\r\nin his repudiation of and antagonism to plans and arrangements, in his\r\nbelief in the overriding power of Law. Their common influence is the\r\ndiscouragement of collective understandings upon the basis of the\r\nexisting state. Both converge in practice upon _laissez faire_. I would\r\ntherefore lump them together under the term of Planless Progressives,\r\nand I would contrast with them those types which believe supremely in\r\nsystematised purpose.\r\n\r\nThe purposeful and systematic types, in common with the Individualist\r\nand Marxist, regard the Normal Social Life, for all the many thousands\r\nof years behind it, as a phase, and as a phase which is now passing, in\r\nhuman experience; and they are prepared for a future society that may be\r\nultimately different right down to its essential relationships from the\r\nhuman past. But they also believe that the forces that have been\r\nassailing and disintegrating the Normal Social Life, which have been, on\r\nthe one hand, producing great accumulations of wealth, private freedom,\r\nand ill-defined, irresponsible and socially dangerous power, and, on the\r\nother, labour hordes, for the most part urban, without any property or\r\noutlook except continuous toil and anxiety, which in England have\r\nsubstituted a dischargeable agricultural labourer for the independent\r\npeasant almost completely, and in America seem to be arresting any\r\ngeneral development of the Normal Social Life at all, are forces of wide\r\nand indefinite possibility that need to be controlled by a collective\r\neffort implying a collective design, deflected from merely injurious\r\nconsequences and organised for a new human welfare upon new lines. They\r\nagree with that class of thinking I have distinguished as the\r\nConservators in their recognition of vast contemporary disorders and\r\ntheir denial of the essential beneficence of change. But while the\r\nformer seem to regard all novelty and innovation as a mere inundation to\r\nbe met, banked back, defeated and survived, these more hopeful and\r\nadventurous minds would rather regard contemporary change as amounting\r\non the whole to the tumultuous and almost catastrophic opening-up of\r\npossible new channels, the violent opportunity of vast, deep, new ways\r\nto great unprecedented human ends, ends that are neither feared nor\r\nevaded.\r\n\r\nNow while the Conservators are continually talking of the \"eternal\r\nfacts\" of human life and human nature and falling back upon a conception\r\nof permanence that is continually less true as our perspectives extend,\r\nthese others are full of the conception of adaptation, of deliberate\r\nchange in relationship and institution to meet changing needs. I would\r\nsuggest for them, therefore, as opposed to the Conservators and\r\ncontrasted with the Planless Progressives, the name of Constructors.\r\nThey are the extreme right, as it were, while the Planless Progressives\r\nare the extreme left of Anti-Conservator thought.\r\n\r\nI believe that these distinctions I have made cover practically every\r\nclear form of contemporary thinking, and are a better and more helpful\r\nclassification than any now current. But, of course, nearly every\r\nindividual nowadays is at least a little confused, and will be found to\r\nwobble in the course even of a brief discussion between one attitude and\r\nthe other. This is a separation of opinions rather than of persons. And\r\nparticularly that word Socialism has become so vague and incoherent that\r\nfor a man to call himself a socialist nowadays is to give no indication\r\nwhatever whether he is a Conservator like William Morris, a\r\nnon-Constructor like Karl Marx, or a Constructor of any of half a dozen\r\ndifferent schools. On the whole, however, modern socialism tends to fall\r\ntowards the Constructor wing. So, too, do those various movements in\r\nEngland and Germany and France called variously nationalist and\r\nimperialist, and so do the American civic and social reformers. Under\r\nthe same heading must come such attempts to give the vague impulses of\r\nSyndicalism a concrete definition as the \"Guild Socialism\" of Mr. Orage.\r\nAll these movements are agreed that the world is progressive towards a\r\nnovel and unprecedented social order, not necessarily and fatally\r\nbetter, and that it needs organised and even institutional guidance\r\nthither, however much they differ as to the form that order should\r\nassume.\r\n\r\nFor the greater portion of a century socialism has been before the\r\nworld, and it is not perhaps premature to attempt a word or so of\r\nanalysis of that great movement in the new terms we are here employing.\r\nThe origins of the socialist idea were complex and multifarious never at\r\nany time has it succeeded in separating out a statement of itself that\r\nwas at once simple, complete and acceptable to any large proportion of\r\nthose who call themselves socialists. But always it has pointed to two\r\nor three definite things. The first of these is that unlimited freedoms\r\nof private property, with increasing facilities of exchange,\r\ncombination, and aggrandisement, become more and more dangerous to\r\nhuman liberty by the expropriation and reduction to private wages\r\nslavery of larger and larger proportions of the population. Every school\r\nof socialism states this in some more or less complete form, however\r\ndivergent the remedial methods suggested by the different schools. And,\r\nnext, every school of socialism accepts the concentration of management\r\nand property as necessary, and declines to contemplate what is the\r\ntypical Conservator remedy, its re-fragmentation. Accordingly it sets up\r\nnot only against the large private owner, but against owners generally,\r\nthe idea of a public proprietor, the State, which shall hold in the\r\ncollective interest. But where the earlier socialisms stopped short, and\r\nwhere to this day socialism is vague, divided, and unprepared, is upon\r\nthe psychological problems involved in that new and largely\r\nunprecedented form of proprietorship, and upon the still more subtle\r\nproblems of its attainment. These are vast, and profoundly, widely, and\r\nmultitudinously difficult problems, and it was natural and inevitable\r\nthat the earlier socialists in the first enthusiasm of their idea should\r\nminimise these difficulties, pretend in the fullness of their faith that\r\npartial answers to objections were complete answers, and display the\r\ncommon weaknesses of honest propaganda the whole world over. Socialism\r\nis now old enough to know better. Few modern socialists present their\r\nfaith as a complete panacea, and most are now setting to work in earnest\r\nupon these long-shirked preliminary problems of human interaction\r\nthrough which the vital problem of a collective head and brain can alone\r\nbe approached.\r\n\r\nA considerable proportion of the socialist movement remains, as it has\r\nbeen from the first, vaguely democratic. It points to collective\r\nownership with no indication of the administrative scheme it\r\ncontemplates to realise that intention. Necessarily it remains a\r\nformless claim without hands to take hold of the thing it desires.\r\nIndeed in a large number of cases it is scarcely more than a resentful\r\nconsciousness in the expropriated masses of social disintegration. It\r\nspends its force very largely in mere revenges upon property as such,\r\nattacks simply destructive by reason of the absence of any definite\r\nulterior scheme. It is an ill-equipped and planless belligerent who must\r\ndestroy whatever he captures because he can neither use nor take away. A\r\ncouncil of democratic socialists in possession of London would be as\r\ncapable of an orderly and sustained administration as the Anabaptists in\r\nMunster. But the discomforts and disorders of our present planless\r\nsystem do tend steadily to the development of this crude socialistic\r\nspirit in the mass of the proletariat; merely vindictive attacks upon\r\nproperty, sabotage, and the general strike are the logical and\r\ninevitable consequences of an uncontrolled concentration of property in\r\na few hands, and such things must and will go on, the deep undertow in\r\nthe deliquescence of the Normal Social Life, until a new justice, a new\r\nscheme of compensations and satisfactions is attained, or the Normal\r\nSocial Life re-emerges.\r\n\r\nFabian socialism was the first systematic attempt to meet the fatal\r\nabsence of administrative schemes in the earlier socialisms. It can\r\nscarcely be regarded now as anything but an interesting failure, but a\r\nfailure that has all the educational value of a first reconnaissance\r\ninto unexplored territory. Starting from that attack on aggregating\r\nproperty, which is the common starting-point of all socialist projects,\r\nthe Fabians, appalled at the obvious difficulties of honest\r\nconfiscation and an open transfer from private to public hands,\r\nconceived the extraordinary idea of _filching_ property for the state. A\r\nsmall body of people of extreme astuteness were to bring about the\r\nmunicipalisation and nationalisation first of this great system of\r\nproperty and then of that, in a manner so artful that the millionaires\r\nwere to wake up one morning at last, and behold, they would find\r\nthemselves poor men! For a decade or more Mr. Pease, Mr. Bernard Shaw,\r\nMr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb, Mrs. Besant, Dr. Lawson Dodd, and their\r\nassociates of the London Fabian Society, did pit their wits and ability,\r\nor at any rate the wits and ability of their leisure moments, against\r\nthe embattled capitalists of England and the world, in this complicated\r\nand delicate enterprise, without any apparent diminution of the larger\r\naccumulations of wealth. But in addition they developed another side of\r\nFabianism, still more subtle, which professed to be a kind of\r\nrestoration in kind of property to the proletariat and in this direction\r\nthey were more successful. A dexterous use, they decided, was to be made\r\nof the Poor Law, the public health authority, the education authority,\r\nand building regulations and so forth, to create, so to speak, a\r\ncommunism of the lower levels. The mass of people whom the forces of\r\nchange had expropriated were to be given a certain minimum of food,\r\nshelter, education, and sanitation, and this, the socialists were\r\nassured, could be used as the thin end of the wedge towards a complete\r\ncommunism. The minimum, once established, could obviously be raised\r\ncontinually until either everybody had what they needed, or the\r\nresources of society gave out and set a limit to the process.\r\n\r\nThis second method of attack brought the Fabian movement into\r\nco-operation with a large amount of benevolent and constructive\r\ninfluence outside the socialist ranks altogether. Few wealthy people\r\nreally grudge the poor a share of the necessities of life, and most are\r\nquite willing to assist in projects for such a distribution. But while\r\nthese schemes naturally involved a very great amount of regulation and\r\nregimentation of the affairs of the poor, the Fabian Society fell away\r\nmore and more from its associated proposals for the socialisation of the\r\nrich. The Fabian project changed steadily in character until at last it\r\nceased to be in any sense antagonistic to wealth as such. If the lion\r\ndid not exactly lie down with the lamb, at any rate the man with the gun\r\nand the alleged social mad dog returned very peaceably together. The\r\nFabian hunt was up.\r\n\r\nGreat financiers contributed generously to a School of Economics that\r\nhad been founded with moneys left to the Fabian Society by earlier\r\nenthusiasts for socialist propaganda and education. It remained for Mr.\r\nBelloc to point the moral of the whole development with a phrase, to\r\nnote that Fabianism no longer aimed at the socialisation of the whole\r\ncommunity, but only at the socialisation of the poor. The first really\r\ncomplete project for a new social order to replace the Normal Social\r\nLife was before the world, and this project was the compulsory\r\nregimentation of the workers and the complete state control of labour\r\nunder a new plutocracy. Our present chaos was to be organised into a\r\nServile State.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 4\r\n\r\nNow to many of us who found the general spirit of the socialist movement\r\nat least hopeful and attractive and sympathetic, this would be an almost\r\ntragic conclusion, did we believe that Fabianism was anything more than\r\nthe first experiment in planning--and one almost inevitably shallow and\r\npresumptuous--of the long series that may be necessary before a clear\r\nlight breaks upon the road humanity must follow. But we decline to be\r\nforced by this one intellectual fiasco towards the _laissez faire_ of\r\nthe Individualist and the Marxist, or to accept the Normal Social Life\r\nwith its atmosphere of hens and cows and dung, its incessant toil, its\r\nservitude of women, and its endless repetitions as the only tolerable\r\nlife conceivable for the bulk of mankind--as the ultimate life, that is,\r\nof mankind. With less arrogance and confidence, but it may be with a\r\nfirmer faith, we declare that we believe a more spacious social order\r\nthan any that exists or ever has existed, a Peace of the World in which\r\nthere is an almost universal freedom, health, happiness, and well-being\r\nand which contains the seeds of a still greater future, is possible to\r\nmankind. We propose to begin again with the recognition of those same\r\ndifficulties the Fabians first realised. But we do not propose to\r\norganise a society, form a group for the control of the two chief\r\npolitical parties, bring about \"socialism\" in twenty-five years, or do\r\nanything beyond contributing in our place and measure to that\r\nconstructive discussion whose real magnitude we now begin to realise.\r\n\r\nWe have faith in a possible future, but it is a faith that makes the\r\nquality of that future entirely dependent upon the strength and\r\nclearness of purpose that this present time can produce. We do not\r\nbelieve the greater social state is inevitable.\r\n\r\nYet there is, we hold, a certain qualified inevitability about this\r\ngreater social state because we believe any social state not affording a\r\ngeneral contentment, a general freedom, and a general and increasing\r\nfullness of life, must sooner or later collapse and disintegrate again,\r\nand revert more or less completely to the Normal Social Life, and\r\nbecause we believe the Normal Social Life is itself thick-sown with the\r\nseeds of fresh beginnings. The Normal Social Life has never at any time\r\nbeen absolutely permanent, always it has carried within itself the germs\r\nof enterprise and adventure and exchanges that finally attack its\r\nstability. The superimposed social order of to-day, such as it is, with\r\nits huge development of expropriated labour, and the schemes of the\r\nlater Fabians to fix this state of affairs in an organised form and\r\nrender it plausibly tolerable, seem also doomed to accumulate\r\ncatastrophic tensions. Bureaucratic schemes for establishing the regular\r\nlifelong subordination of a labouring class, enlivened though they may\r\nbe by frequent inspection, disciplinary treatment during seasons of\r\nunemployment, compulsory temperance, free medical attendance, and a\r\ncheap and shallow elementary education fail to satisfy the restless\r\ncravings in the heart of man. They are cravings that even the baffling\r\nmethods of the most ingeniously worked Conciliation Boards cannot\r\npermanently restrain. The drift of any Servile State must be towards a\r\nclass revolt, paralysing sabotage and a general strike. The more rigid\r\nand complete the Servile State becomes, the more thorough will be its\r\nultimate failure. Its fate is decay or explosion. From its d\u00e9bris we\r\nshall either revert to the Normal Social Life and begin again the long\r\nstruggle towards that ampler, happier, juster arrangement of human\r\naffairs which we of this book, at any rate, believe to be possible, or\r\nwe shall pass into the twilight of mankind.\r\n\r\nThis greater social life we put, then, as the only real alternative to\r\nthe Normal Social Life from which man is continually escaping. For it we\r\ndo not propose to use the expressions the \"socialist state\" or\r\n\"socialism,\" because we believe those terms have now by constant\r\nconfused use become so battered and bent and discoloured by irrelevant\r\nassociations as to be rather misleading than expressive. We propose to\r\nuse the term The Great State to express this ideal of a social system no\r\nlonger localised, no longer immediately tied to and conditioned by the\r\ncultivation of the land, world-wide in its interests and outlook and\r\ncatholic in its tolerance and sympathy, a system of great individual\r\nfreedom with a universal understanding among its citizens of a\r\ncollective thought and purpose.\r\n\r\nNow, the difficulties that lie in the way of humanity in its complex and\r\ntoilsome journey through the coming centuries towards this Great State\r\nare fundamentally difficulties of adaptation and adjustment. To no\r\nconceivable social state is man inherently fitted: he is a creature of\r\njealousy and suspicion, unstable, restless, acquisitive, aggressive,\r\nintractable, and of a most subtle and nimble dishonesty. Moreover, he is\r\nimaginative, adventurous, and inventive. His nature and instincts are as\r\nmuch in conflict with the necessary restrictions and subjugation of the\r\nNormal Social Life as they are likely to be with any other social net\r\nthat necessity may weave about him. But the Normal Social Life has this\r\nadvantage that it has a vast accumulated moral tradition and a minutely\r\nworked-out material method. All the fundamental institutions have arisen\r\nin relation to it and are adapted to its conditions. To revert to it\r\nafter any phase of social chaos and distress is and will continue for\r\nmany years to be the path of least resistance for perplexed humanity.\r\n\r\nThis conception of the Great State, on the other hand, is still\r\naltogether unsubstantial. It is a project as dream-like to-day as\r\nelectric lighting, electric traction, or aviation would have been in the\r\nyear 1850. In 1850 a man reasonably conversant with the physical science\r\nof his time could have declared with a very considerable confidence\r\nthat, given a certain measure of persistence and social security, these\r\nthings were more likely to be attained than not in the course of the\r\nnext century. But such a prophecy was conditional on the preliminary\r\naccumulation of a considerable amount of knowledge, on many experiments\r\nand failures. Had the world of 1850, by some wave of impulse, placed all\r\nits resources in the hands of the ablest scientific man alive, and asked\r\nhim to produce a practicable paying electric vehicle before 1852, at\r\nbest he would have produced some clumsy, curious toy, more probably he\r\nwould have failed altogether; and, similarly, if the whole population of\r\nthe world came to the present writer and promised meekly to do whatever\r\nit was told, we should find ourselves still very largely at a loss in\r\nour project for a millennium. Yet just as nearly every man at work upon\r\nVoltaic electricity in 1850 knew that he was preparing for electric\r\ntraction, so do I know quite certainly, in spite of a whole row of\r\nunsolved problems before me, that I am working towards the Great State.\r\n\r\nLet me briefly recapitulate the main problems which have to be attacked\r\nin the attempt to realise the outline of the Great State. At the base of\r\nthe whole order there must be some method of agricultural production,\r\nand if the agricultural labourer and cottager and the ancient life of\r\nthe small householder on the holding, a life laborious, prolific,\r\nilliterate, limited, and in immediate contact with the land used, is to\r\nrecede and disappear it must recede and disappear before methods upon a\r\nmuch larger scale, employing wholesale machinery and involving great\r\neconomies. It is alleged by modern writers that the permanent residence\r\nof the cultivator in close relation to his ground is a legacy from the\r\ndays of cumbrous and expensive transit, that the great proportion of\r\nfarm work is seasonal, and that a migration to and fro between rural and\r\nurban conditions would be entirely practicable in a largely planned\r\ncommunity. The agricultural population could move out of town into an\r\nopen-air life as the spring approached, and return for spending,\r\npleasure, and education as the days shortened. Already something of this\r\nsort occurs under extremely unfavourable conditions in the movement of\r\nthe fruit and hop pickers from the east end of London into Kent, but\r\nthat is a mere hint of the extended picnic which a broadly planned\r\ncultivation might afford. A fully developed civilisation, employing\r\nmachines in the hands of highly skilled men, will minimise toil to the\r\nvery utmost, no man will shove where a machine can shove, or carry where\r\na machine can carry; but there will remain, more particularly in the\r\nsummer, a vast amount of hand operations, invigorating and even\r\nattractive to the urban population Given short hours, good pay, and all\r\nthe jolly amusement in the evening camp that a free, happy, and\r\nintelligent people will develop for themselves, and there will be\r\nlittle difficulty about this particular class of work to differentiate\r\nit from any other sort of necessary labour.\r\n\r\nOne passes, therefore, with no definite transition from the root problem\r\nof agricultural production in the Great State to the wider problem of\r\nlabour in general.\r\n\r\nA glance at the countryside conjures up a picture of extensive tracts\r\nbeing cultivated on a wholesale scale, of skilled men directing great\r\nploughing, sowing, and reaping plants, steering cattle and sheep about\r\ncarefully designed enclosures, constructing channels and guiding sewage\r\ntowards its proper destination on the fields, and then of added crowds\r\nof genial people coming out to spray trees and plants, pick and sort and\r\npack fruits. But who are these people? Why are they in particular doing\r\nthis for the community? Is our Great State still to have a majority of\r\npeople glad to do commonplace work for mediocre wages, and will there be\r\nother individuals who will ride by on the roads, sympathetically, no\r\ndoubt, but with a secret sense of superiority? So one opens the general\r\nproblem of the organisation for labour.\r\n\r\nI am careful here to write \"for labour\" and not \"of Labour,\" because it\r\nis entirely against the spirit of the Great State that any section of\r\nthe people should be set aside as a class to do most of the monotonous,\r\nlaborious, and uneventful things for the community. That is practically\r\nthe present arrangement, and that, with a quickened sense of the need of\r\nbreaking people in to such a life, is the ideal of the bureaucratic\r\nServile State to which, in common with the Conservators, we are bitterly\r\nopposed. And here I know I am at my most difficult, most speculative,\r\nand most revolutionary point. We who look to the Great State as the\r\npresent aim of human progress believe a state may solve its economic\r\nproblem without any section whatever of the community being condemned to\r\nlifelong labour. And contemporary events, the phenomena of recent\r\nstrikes, the phenomena of sabotage, carry out the suggestion that in a\r\ncommunity where nearly everyone reads extensively travels about, sees\r\nthe charm and variety in the lives of prosperous and leisurely people,\r\nno class is going to submit permanently to modern labour conditions\r\nwithout extreme resistance, even after the most elaborate Labour\r\nConciliation schemes and social minima are established Things are\r\naltogether too stimulating to the imagination nowadays. Of all\r\nimpossible social dreams that belief in tranquillised and submissive and\r\nvirtuous Labour is the wildest of all. No sort of modern men will stand\r\nit. They will as a class do any vivid and disastrous thing rather than\r\nstand it. Even the illiterate peasant will only endure lifelong toil\r\nunder the stimulus of private ownership and with the consolations of\r\nreligion; and the typical modern worker has neither the one nor the\r\nother. For a time, indeed, for a generation or so even, a labour mass\r\nmay be fooled or coerced, but in the end it will break out against its\r\nsubjection, even if it breaks out to a general social catastrophe.\r\n\r\nWe have, in fact, to invent for the Great State, if we are to suppose\r\nany Great State at all, an economic method without any specific labour\r\nclass. If we cannot do so, we had better throw ourselves in with the\r\nConservators forthwith, for they are right and we are absurd. Adhesion\r\nto the conception of the Great State involves adhesion to the belief\r\nthat the amount of regular labour, skilled and unskilled, required to\r\nproduce everything necessary for everyone living in its highly elaborate\r\ncivilisation may, under modern conditions, with the help of scientific\r\neconomy and power-producing machinery, be reduced to so small a number\r\nof working hours per head in proportion to the average life of the\r\ncitizen, as to be met as regards the greater moiety of it by the payment\r\nof wages over and above the gratuitous share of each individual in the\r\ngeneral output; and as regards the residue, a residue of rough,\r\ndisagreeable, and monotonous operations, by some form of conscription,\r\nwhich will demand a year or so, let us say, of each person's life for\r\nthe public service. If we reflect that in the contemporary state there\r\nis already food, shelter, and clothing of a sort for everyone, in spite\r\nof the fact that enormous numbers of people do no productive work at all\r\nbecause they are too well off, that great numbers are out of work, great\r\nnumbers by bad nutrition and training incapable of work, and that an\r\nenormous amount of the work actually done is the overlapping production\r\nof competitive trade and work upon such politically necessary but\r\nsocially useless things as Dreadnoughts, it becomes clear that the\r\nabsolutely unavoidable labour in a modern community and its ratio to the\r\navailable vitality must be of very small account indeed. But all this\r\nhas still to be worked out even in the most general terms. An\r\nintelligent science of economics should afford standards and\r\ntechnicalities and systematised facts upon which to base an estimate.\r\nThe point was raised a quarter of a century ago by Morris in his \"News\r\nfrom Nowhere,\" and indeed it was already discussed by More in his\r\n\"Utopia.\" Our contemporary economics is, however, still a foolish,\r\npretentious pseudo-science, a festering mass of assumptions about buying\r\nand selling and wages-paying, and one would as soon consult Bradshaw or\r\nthe works of Dumas as our orthodox professors of economics for any\r\nlight upon this fundamental matter.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we believe that there is a real disposition to work in human\r\nbeings, and that in a well-equipped community, in which no one was under\r\nan unavoidable urgency to work, the greater proportion of productive\r\noperations could be made sufficiently attractive to make them desirable\r\noccupations. As for the irreducible residue of undesirable toil, I owe\r\nto my friend the late Professor William James this suggestion of a\r\ngeneral conscription and a period of public service for everyone, a\r\nsuggestion which greatly occupied his thoughts during the last years of\r\nhis life. He was profoundly convinced of the high educational and\r\ndisciplinary value of universal compulsory military service, and of the\r\nneed of something more than a sentimental ideal of duty in public life.\r\nHe would have had the whole population taught in the schools and\r\nprepared for this year (or whatever period it had to be) of patient and\r\nheroic labour, the men for the mines, the fisheries, the sanitary\r\nservices, railway routine, the women for hospital, and perhaps\r\neducational work, and so forth. He believed such a service would\r\npermeate the whole state with a sense of civic obligation....\r\n\r\nBut behind all these conceivable triumphs of scientific adjustment and\r\ndirection lies the infinitely greater difficulty on our way to the Great\r\nState, the difficulty of direction. What sort of people are going to\r\ndistribute the work of the community, decide what is or is not to be\r\ndone, determine wages, initiate enterprises; and under what sort of\r\ncriticism, checks, and controls are they going to do this delicate and\r\nextensive work? With this we open the whole problem of government,\r\nadministration and officialdom.\r\n\r\nThe Marxist and the democratic socialist generally shirk this riddle\r\naltogether; the Fabian conception of a bureaucracy, official to the\r\nextent of being a distinct class and cult, exists only as a\r\nstarting-point for healthy repudiations. Whatever else may be worked out\r\nin the subtler answers our later time prepares, nothing can be clearer\r\nthan that the necessary machinery of government must be elaborately\r\norganised to prevent the development of a managing caste in permanent\r\nconspiracy, tacit or expressed, against the normal man. Quite apart from\r\nthe danger of unsympathetic and fatally irritating government there can\r\nbe little or no doubt that the method of making men officials for life\r\nis quite the worst way of getting official duties done. Officialdom is a\r\nspecies of incompetence. This rather priggish, teachable, and\r\nwell-behaved sort of boy, who is attracted by the prospect of assured\r\nincome and a pension to win his way into the Civil Service, and who then\r\nby varied assiduities rises to a sort of timidly vindictive importance,\r\nis the last person to whom we would willingly entrust the vital\r\ninterests of a nation. We want people who know about life at large, who\r\nwill come to the public service seasoned by experience, not people who\r\nhave specialised and acquired that sort of knowledge which is called, in\r\nmuch the same spirit of qualification as one speaks of German Silver,\r\nExpert Knowledge. It is clear our public servants and officials must be\r\nso only for their periods of service. They must be taught by life, and\r\nnot \"trained\" by pedagogues. In every continuing job there is a time\r\nwhen one is crude and blundering, a time, the best time, when one is\r\nfull of the freshness and happiness of doing well, and a time when\r\nroutine has largely replaced the stimulus of novelty. The Great State\r\nwill, I feel convinced, regard changes in occupation as a proper\r\ncircumstance in the life of every citizen; it will value a certain\r\namateurishness in its service, and prefer it to the trite omniscience of\r\nthe stale official. On that score of the necessity or versatility, if on\r\nno other score, I am flatly antagonistic to the conceptions of \"Guild\r\nSocialism\" which have arisen recently out of the impact of Mr. Penty and\r\nSyndicalism upon the uneasy intelligence of Mr. Orage.\r\n\r\nAnd since the Fabian socialists have created a widespread belief that in\r\ntheir projected state every man will be necessarily a public servant or\r\na public pupil because the state will be the only employer and the only\r\neducator, it is necessary to point out that the Great State presupposes\r\nneither the one nor the other. It is a form of liberty and not a form of\r\nenslavement. We agree with the older forms of socialism in supposing an\r\ninitial proprietary independence in every citizen. The citizen is a\r\nshareholder in the state. Above that and after that, he works if he\r\nchooses. But if he likes to live on his minimum and do nothing--though\r\nsuch a type of character is scarcely conceivable--he can. His earning is\r\nhis own surplus. Above the basal economics of the Great State we assume\r\nwith confidence there will be a huge surplus of free spending upon\r\nextra-collective ends. Public organisations, for example, may distribute\r\nimpartially and possibly even print and make ink and paper for the\r\nnewspapers in the Great State, but they will certainly not own them.\r\nOnly doctrine-driven men have ever ventured to think they would. Nor\r\nwill the state control writers and artists, for example, nor the\r\nstage--though it may build and own theatres--the tailor, the dressmaker,\r\nthe restaurant cook, an enormous multitude of other busy\r\nworkers-for-preferences. In the Great State of the future, as in the\r\nlife of the more prosperous classes of to-day, the greater proportion of\r\noccupations and activities will be private and free.\r\n\r\nI would like to underline in the most emphatic way that it is possible\r\nto have this Great State, essentially socialistic, owning and running\r\nthe land and all the great public services, sustaining everybody in\r\nabsolute freedom at a certain minimum of comfort and well-being, and\r\nstill leaving most of the interests, amusements, and adornments of the\r\nindividual life, and all sorts of collective concerns, social and\r\npolitical discussion, religious worship, philosophy, and the like to the\r\nfree personal initiatives of entirely unofficial people.\r\n\r\nThis still leaves the problem of systematic knowledge and research, and\r\nall the associated problems of aesthetic, moral, and intellectual\r\ninitiative to be worked out in detail; but at least it dispels the\r\nnightmare of a collective mind organised as a branch of the civil\r\nservice, with authors, critics, artists, scientific investigators\r\nappointed in a phrensy of wire-pulling--as nowadays the British state\r\nappoints its bishops for the care of its collective soul.\r\n\r\nLet me now indicate how these general views affect the problem of family\r\norganisation and the problem of women's freedom. In the Normal Social\r\nLife the position of women is easily defined. They are subordinated but\r\nimportant. The citizenship rests with the man, and the woman's relation\r\nto the community as a whole is through a man. But within that limitation\r\nher functions as mother, wife, and home-maker are cardinal. It is one of\r\nthe entirely unforeseen consequences that have arisen from the decay of\r\nthe Normal Social Life and its autonomous home that great numbers of\r\nwomen while still subordinate have become profoundly unimportant They\r\nhave ceased to a very large extent to bear children, they have dropped\r\nmost of their home-making arts, they no longer nurse nor educate such\r\nchildren as they have, and they have taken on no new functions that\r\ncompensate for these dwindling activities of the domestic interior. That\r\nsubjugation which is a vital condition to the Normal Social Life does\r\nnot seem to be necessary to the Great State. It may or it may not be\r\nnecessary. And here we enter upon the most difficult of all our\r\nproblems. The whole spirit of the Great State is against any avoidable\r\nsubjugation; but the whole spirit of that science which will animate the\r\nGreat State forbids us to ignore woman's functional and temperamental\r\ndifferences. A new status has still to be invented for women, a Feminine\r\nCitizenship differing in certain respects from the normal masculine\r\ncitizenship. Its conditions remain to be worked out. We have indeed to\r\nwork out an entire new system of relations between men and women, that\r\nwill be free from servitude, aggression, provocation, or parasitism. The\r\npublic Endowment of Motherhood as such may perhaps be the first broad\r\nsuggestion of the quality of this new status. A new type of family, a\r\nmutual alliance in the place of a subjugation, is perhaps the most\r\nstartling of all the conceptions which confront us directly we turn\r\nourselves definitely towards the Great State.\r\n\r\nAnd as our conception of the Great State grows, so we shall begin to\r\nrealise the nature of the problem of transition, the problem of what we\r\nmay best do in the confusion of the present time to elucidate and render\r\npracticable this new phase of human organisation. Of one thing there\r\ncan be no doubt, that whatever increases thought and knowledge moves\r\ntowards our goal; and equally certain is it that nothing leads thither\r\nthat tampers with the freedom of spirit, the independence of soul in\r\ncommon men and women. In many directions, therefore, the believer in the\r\nGreat State will display a jealous watchfulness of contemporary\r\ndevelopments rather than a premature constructiveness. We must watch\r\nwealth; but quite as necessary it is to watch the legislator, who\r\nmistakes propaganda for progress and class exasperation to satisfy class\r\nvindictiveness for construction. Supremely important is it to keep\r\ndiscussion open, to tolerate no limitation on the freedom of speech,\r\nwriting, art and book distribution, and to sustain the utmost liberty of\r\ncriticism upon all contemporary institutions and processes.\r\n\r\nThis briefly is the programme of problems and effort to which my idea of\r\nthe Great State, as the goal of contemporary progress, leads me.\r\n\r\nThe diagram on p. 131 shows compactly the gist of the preceding\r\ndiscussion; it gives the view of social development upon which I base\r\nall my political conceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORMAL SOCIAL LIFE\r\n\r\nproduces an increasing surplus of energy and opportunity, more\r\nparticularly under modern conditions of scientific organisation and\r\npower production; and this through the operation of rent and of usury\r\ntends to\r\n                                    |\r\n                     |------------------------------|\r\n               (a) release         and       (b) expropriate\r\n                     |                              |\r\n      an increasing proportion of the population to become:\r\n                     |                              |\r\n  (_a_) A LEISURE CLASS       and      (_b_) A LABOUR CLASS\r\n       under no urgent compulsion           divorced from the land and\r\n                 to work                   living upon uncertain wages\r\n   |3       |2       |1                             |1       2      3|\r\n   |        |   which may degenerate     degenerate          |       |\r\n   |        |   into a waster class      into a sweated,     |       |\r\n   |        |                \\           overworked,         |       |\r\n   |        |                 \\          violently           |       |\r\n   |        |                  \\         resentful           |       |\r\n   |        |                   \\        and destructive     |       |\r\n   |        |                    \\       rebel class         |       |\r\n   |        |                     \\       /                  |       |\r\n   |        |                  and produce a                 |       |\r\n   |        |                  SOCIAL DEBACLE                |       |\r\n   |        |                                                |       |\r\n   |   which may become                           which may become   |\r\n   |   a Governing                                the controlled     |\r\n   |   Class (with waster                         regimented         |\r\n   |   elements) in                               and disciplined    |\r\n   |   an unprogressive                           Labour Class of    |\r\n   |   Bureaucratic        <----------------->    an unprogressive   |\r\n   |   SERVILE STATE                              Bureaucratic       |\r\n   |                                              SERVILE STATE      |\r\n   |                                                                 |\r\n  which may become                                    which may be\r\n  the whole community                                 rendered needless\r\n  of the GREAT STATE                                  by a universal\r\n  working under various                               compulsory year\r\n  motives and inducements                             or so of labour\r\n  but not constantly,                                 service together\r\n  nor permanently                                     with a scientific\r\n  nor unwillingly                                     organisation\r\n                                                      of production,\r\n                                                      and so reabsorbed\r\n                                                      by re-endowment\r\n                                                      into the Leisure\r\n                                                      Class of the\r\n                                                      GREAT STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON SENSE OF WARFARE\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1\r\n\r\nCONSCRIPTION\r\n\r\nI want to say as compactly as possible why I do not believe that\r\nconscription would increase the military efficiency of this country, and\r\nwhy I think it might be a disastrous step for this country to take.\r\n\r\nBy conscription I mean the compulsory enlistment for a term of service\r\nin the Army of the whole manhood of the country. And I am writing now\r\nfrom the point of view merely of military effectiveness. The educational\r\nvalue of a universal national service, the idea which as a Socialist I\r\nsupport very heartily, of making every citizen give a year or so of his\r\nlife to our public needs, are matters quite outside my present\r\ndiscussion. What I am writing about now is this idea that the country\r\ncan be strengthened for war by making every man in it a bit of a\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nAnd I want the reader to be perfectly clear about the position I assume\r\nwith regard to war preparations generally. I am not pleading for peace\r\nwhen there is no peace; this country has been constantly threatened\r\nduring the past decade, and is threatened now by gigantic hostile\r\npreparations; it is our common interest to be and to keep at the maximum\r\nof military efficiency possible to us. My case is not merely that\r\nconscription will not contribute to that, but that it would be a\r\nmonstrous diversion of our energy and emotion and material resources\r\nfrom the things that need urgently to be done. It would be like a boxer\r\nfilling his arms with empty boxing-gloves and then rushing--his face\r\nprotruding over the armful--into the fray.\r\n\r\nLet me make my attack on this prevalent and increasing superstition of\r\nthe British need for conscription in two lines, one following the other.\r\nFor, firstly, it is true that Britain at the present time is no more\r\ncapable of creating such a conscript army as France or Germany possesses\r\nin the next ten years than she is of covering her soil with a tropical\r\nforest, and, secondly, it is equally true that if she had such an army\r\nit would not be of the slightest use to her. For the conscript armies in\r\nwhich Europe still so largely believes are only of use against conscript\r\narmies and adversaries who will consent to play the rules of the German\r\nwar game; they are, if we chose to determine they shall be, if we chose\r\nto deal with them as they should be dealt with, as out of date as a\r\nRoman legion or a Zulu impi.\r\n\r\nNow, first, as to the impossibility of getting our great army into\r\nexistence. All those people who write and talk so glibly in favour of\r\nconscription seem to forget that to take a common man, and more\r\nparticularly a townsman, clap him into a uniform and put a rifle in his\r\nhand does not make a soldier. He has to be taught not only the use of\r\nhis weapons, but the methods of a strange and unfamiliar life out of\r\ndoors; he has to be not simply drilled, but accustomed to the difficult\r\nmodern necessities of open order fighting, of taking cover, of\r\nentrenchment, and he has to have created within him, so that it will\r\nstand the shock of seeing men killed round about him, confidence in\r\nhimself, in his officers, and the methods and weapons of his side.\r\nBody, mind, and imagination have all to be trained--and they need\r\ntrainers. The conversion of a thousand citizens into anything better\r\nthan a sheep-like militia demands the enthusiastic services of scores of\r\nable and experienced instructors who know what war is; the creation of a\r\nuniversal army demands the services of many scores of thousands of not\r\nsimply \"old soldiers,\" but keen, expert, modern-minded _officers_.\r\n\r\nWithout these officers our citizen army would be a hydra without heads.\r\nAnd we haven't these officers. We haven't a tithe of them.\r\n\r\nWe haven't these officers, and we can't make them in a hurry. It takes\r\nat least five years to make an officer who knows his trade. It needs a\r\nspecial gift, in addition to that knowledge, to make a man able to\r\nimpart it. And our Empire is at a peculiar disadvantage in the matter,\r\nbecause India and our other vast areas of service and opportunity\r\noverseas drain away a large proportion of just those able and educated\r\nmen who would in other countries gravitate towards the army. Such small\r\nwealth of officers as we have--and I am quite prepared to believe that\r\nthe officers we have are among the very best in the world--are scarcely\r\nenough to go round our present supply of private soldiers. And the best\r\nand most brilliant among this scanty supply are being drawn upon more\r\nand more for aerial work, and for all that increasing quantity of highly\r\nspecialised services which are manifestly destined to be the real\r\nfighting forces of the future. We cannot spare the best of our officers\r\nfor training conscripts; we shall get the dismallest results from the\r\nworst of them; and so even if it were a vital necessity for our country\r\nto have an army of all its manhood now, we could not have it, and it\r\nwould be a mere last convulsion to attempt to make it with the means at\r\nour disposal.\r\n\r\nBut that brings me to my second contention, which is that we do not want\r\nsuch an army. I believe that the vast masses of men in uniform\r\nmaintained by the Continental Powers at the present time are enormously\r\noverrated as fighting machines. I see Germany in the likeness of a boxer\r\nwith a mailed fist as big as and rather heavier than its body, and I am\r\nconvinced that when the moment comes for that mailed fist to be lifted,\r\nthe whole disproportionate system will topple over. The military\r\nascendancy of the future lies with the country that dares to experiment\r\nmost, that experiments best, and meanwhile keeps its actual fighting\r\nforce fit and admirable and small and flexible. The experience of war\r\nduring the last fifteen years has been to show repeatedly the enormous\r\ndefensive power of small, scientifically handled bodies of men. These\r\nhuge conscript armies are made up not of masses of military muscle, but\r\nof a huge proportion of military fat. Their one way of fighting will be\r\nto fall upon an antagonist with all their available weight, and if he is\r\nmobile and dexterous enough to decline that issue of adiposity they will\r\nbecome a mere embarrassment to their own people. Modern weapons and\r\nmodern contrivance are continually decreasing the number of men who can\r\nbe employed efficiently upon a length of front. I doubt if there is any\r\nuse for more than 400,000 men upon the whole Franco-Belgian frontier at\r\nthe present time. Such an army, properly supplied, could--so far as\r\nterrestrial forces are concerned--hold that frontier against any number\r\nof assailants. The bigger the forces brought against it the sooner the\r\nexhaustion of the attacking power. Now, it is for employment upon that\r\nfrontier, and for no other conceivable purpose in the world, that Great\r\nBritain is asked to create a gigantic conscript army.\r\n\r\nAnd if too big an army is likely to be a mere encumbrance in war, it is\r\nperhaps even a still graver blunder to maintain one during that conflict\r\nof preparation which is at present the European substitute for actual\r\nhostilities. It consumes. It produces nothing. It not only eats and\r\ndrinks and wears out its clothes and withdraws men from industry, but\r\nunder the stress of invention it needs constantly to be re-armed and\r\nfreshly equipped at an expenditure proportionate to its size. So long as\r\nthe conflict of preparation goes on, then the bigger the army your\r\nadversary maintains under arms the bigger is his expenditure and the\r\nless his earning power. The less the force you employ to keep your\r\nadversary over-armed, and the longer you remain at peace with him while\r\nhe is over-armed, the greater is your advantage. There is only one\r\nprofitable use for any army, and that is victorious conflict. Every army\r\nthat is not engaged in victorious conflict is an organ of national\r\nexpenditure, an exhausting growth in the national body. And for Great\r\nBritain an attempt to create a conscript army would involve the very\r\nmaximum of moral and material exhaustion with the minimum of military\r\nefficiency. It would be a disastrous waste of resources that we need\r\nmost urgently for other things.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2\r\n\r\nIn the popular imagination the Dreadnought is still the one instrument\r\nof naval war. We count our strength in Dreadnoughts and\r\nSuper-Dreadnoughts, and so long as we are spending our national\r\nresources upon them faster than any other country, if we sink at least\r\n\u00a3160 for every \u00a3100 sunk in these obsolescent monsters by Germany, we\r\nhave a reassuring sense of keeping ahead and being thoroughly safe. This\r\nconfidence in big, very expensive battleships is, I believe and hope,\r\nshared by the German Government and by Europe generally, but it is,\r\nnevertheless, a very unreasonable confidence, and it may easily lead us\r\ninto the most tragic of national disillusionments.\r\n\r\nWe of the general public are led to suppose that the next naval war--if\r\never we engage in another naval war--will begin with a decisive fleet\r\naction. The plan of action is presented with an alluring simplicity. Our\r\nadversary will come out to us, in a ratio of 10 to 16, or in some ratio\r\nstill more advantageous to us, according as our adversary happens to be\r\nthis Power or that Power, there will be some tremendous business with\r\nguns and torpedoes, and our admirals will return victorious to discuss\r\nthe discipline and details of the battle and each other's little\r\nweaknesses in the monthly magazines. This is a desirable but improbable\r\nanticipation. No hostile Power is in the least likely to send out any\r\nbattleships at all against our invincible Dreadnoughts. They will\r\npromenade the seas, always in the ratio of 16 or more to 10, looking for\r\nfleets securely tucked away out of reach. They will not, of course, go\r\ntoo near the enemy's coast, on account of mines, and, meanwhile, our\r\ncruisers will hunt the enemy's commerce into port.\r\n\r\nThen other things will happen.\r\n\r\nThe enemy we shall discover using unsportsmanlike devices against our\r\ncapital ships. Unless he is a lunatic, he will prove to be much stronger\r\nin reality than he is on paper in the matter of submarines,\r\ntorpedo-boats, waterplanes and aeroplanes. These are things cheap to\r\nmake and easy to conceal. He will be richly stocked with ingenious\r\ndevices for getting explosives up to these two million pound triumphs of\r\nour naval engineering. On the cloudy and foggy nights so frequent about\r\nthese islands he will have extraordinary chances, and sooner or later,\r\nunless we beat him thoroughly in the air above and in the waters\r\nbeneath, for neither of which proceedings we are prepared, some of these\r\nchances will come off, and we shall lose a Dreadnought.\r\n\r\nIt will be a poor consolation if an ill-advised and stranded Zeppelin or\r\nso enlivens the quiet of the English countryside by coming down and\r\ncapitulating. It will be a trifling countershock to wing an aeroplane or\r\nso, or blow a torpedo-boat out of the water. Our Dreadnoughts will cease\r\nto be a source of unmitigated confidence A second battleship disaster\r\nwill excite the Press extremely. A third will probably lead to a\r\nretirement of the battle fleet to some east coast harbour, a refuge\r\nliable to aeroplanes, or to the west coast of Ireland--and the real\r\nnaval war, which, as I have argued in an earlier chapter, will be a war\r\nof destroyers, submarines and hydroplanes, will begin. Incidentally a\r\ncommerce destroyer may take advantage of the retirement of our fleet to\r\nraid our trade routes.\r\n\r\nWe shall then realise that the actual naval weapons are these smaller\r\nweapons, and especially the destroyer, the submarine, and the\r\nwaterplane--the waterplane most of all, because of its possibilities of\r\na comparative bigness--in the hands of competent and daring men. And I\r\nfind myself, as a patriotic Englishman, more and more troubled by doubts\r\nwhether we are as certainly superior to any possible adversary in these\r\nessential things as we are in the matter of Dreadnoughts. I find myself\r\nawake at nights, after a day much agitated by a belligerent Press,\r\nwondering whether the real Empire of the Sea may not even now have\r\nslipped out of our hands while our attention has been fixed on our\r\nstately procession of giant warships, while our country has been in a\r\ndream, hypnotised by the Dreadnought idea.\r\n\r\nFor some years there seems to have been a complete arrest of the British\r\nimagination in naval and military matters. That declining faculty, never\r\na very active or well-exercised one, staggered up to the conception of a\r\nDreadnought, and seems now to have sat down for good. Its reply to every\r\ndemand upon it has been \"more Dreadnoughts.\" The future, as we British\r\nseem to see it, is an avenue of Dreadnoughts and Super-Dreadnoughts and\r\nSuper-Super-Dreadnoughts, getting bigger and bigger in a kind of\r\ninverted perspective. But the ascendancy of fleets of great battleships\r\nin naval warfare, like the phase of huge conscript armies upon land,\r\ndraws to its close. The progress of invention makes both the big ship\r\nand the army crowd more and more vulnerable and less and less effective.\r\nA new phase of warfare opens beyond the vista of our current programmes.\r\nSmaller, more numerous and various and mobile weapons and craft and\r\ncontrivances, manned by daring and highly skilled men, must ultimately\r\ntake the place of those massivenesses. We are entering upon a period in\r\nwhich the invention of methods and material for war is likely to be more\r\nrapid and diversified than it has ever been before, and the question of\r\nwhat we have been doing behind the splendid line of our Dreadnoughts to\r\nmeet the demands of this new phase is one of supreme importance.\r\nKnowing, as I do, the imaginative indolence of my countrymen, it is a\r\nquestion I face with something very near to dismay.\r\n\r\nBut it is one that has to be faced. The question that should occupy our\r\ndirecting minds now is no longer \"How can we get more Dreadnoughts?\" but\r\n\"What have we to follow the Dreadnought?\"\r\n\r\nTo the Power that has most nearly guessed the answer to that riddle\r\nbelongs the future Empire of the Seas. It is interesting to guess for\r\noneself and to speculate upon the possibility of a kind of armoured\r\nmother-ship for waterplanes and submarines and torpedo craft, but\r\nnecessarily that would be a mere journalistic and amateurish guessing. I\r\nam not guessing, but asking urgent questions. What force, what council,\r\nhow many imaginative and inventive men has the country got at the\r\npresent time employed not casually but professionally in anticipating\r\nthe new strategy, the new tactics, the new material, the new training\r\nthat invention is so rapidly rendering necessary? I have the gravest\r\ndoubts whether we are doing anything systematic at all in this way.\r\n\r\nNow, it is the tremendous seriousness of this deficiency to which I want\r\nto call attention. Great Britain has in her armour a gap more dangerous\r\nand vital than any mere numerical insufficiency of men or ships. She is\r\nshort of minds. Behind its strength of current armaments to-day, a\r\nstrength that begins to evaporate and grow obsolete from the very moment\r\nit comes into being, a country needs more and more this profounder\r\nstrength of intellectual and creative activity.\r\n\r\nThis country most of all, which was left so far behind in the production\r\nof submarines, airships and aeroplanes, must be made to realise the\r\nfolly of its trust in established things. Each new thing we take up more\r\nbelatedly and reluctantly than its predecessor. The time is not far\r\ndistant when we shall be \"caught\" lagging unless we change all this.\r\n\r\nWe need a new arm to our service; we need it urgently, and we shall need\r\nit more and more, and that arm is Research. We need to place inquiry and\r\nexperiment upon a new footing altogether, to enlist for them and\r\norganise them, to secure the pick of our young chemists and physicists\r\nand engineers, and to get them to work systematically upon the\r\nanticipation and preparation of our future war equipment. We need a\r\nservice of invention to recover our lost lead in these matters.\r\n\r\nAnd it is because I feel so keenly the want of such a service, and the\r\nwant of great sums of money for it, that I deplore the disposition to\r\nwaste millions upon the hasty creation of a universal service army and\r\nupon excessive Dreadnoughting. I am convinced that we are spending upon\r\nthe things of yesterday the money that is sorely needed for the things\r\nof to-morrow.\r\n\r\nWith our eyes averted obstinately from the future we are backing towards\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3\r\n\r\nIn the present armament competition there are certain considerations\r\nthat appear to be almost universally overlooked, and which tend to\r\nmodify our views profoundly of what should be done. Ultimately they will\r\naffect our entire expenditure upon war preparation.\r\n\r\nExpenditure upon preparation for war falls, roughly, into two classes:\r\nthere is expenditure upon things that have a diminishing value, things\r\nthat grow old-fashioned and wear out, such as fortifications, ships,\r\nguns, and ammunition, and expenditure upon things that have a permanent\r\nand even growing value, such as organised technical research, military\r\nand naval experiment, and the education and increase of a highly trained\r\nclass of war experts.\r\n\r\nI want to suggest that we are spending too much money in the former and\r\nnot enough in the latter direction We are buying enormous quantities of\r\nstuff that will be old iron in twenty years' time, and we are starving\r\nourselves of that which cannot be bought or made in a hurry, and upon\r\nwhich the strength of nations ultimately rests altogether; we are\r\nfailing to get and maintain a sufficiency of highly educated and\r\ndeveloped men inspired by a tradition of service and efficiency.\r\n\r\nNo doubt we must be armed to-day, but every penny we divert from\r\nmen-making and knowledge-making to armament beyond the margin of bare\r\nsafety is a sacrifice of the future to the present. Every penny we\r\ndivert from national wealth-making to national weapons means so much\r\nless in resources, so much more strain in the years ahead. But a great\r\nsystem of laboratories and experimental stations, a systematic,\r\nindustrious increase of men of the officer-aviator type, of the\r\nresearch student type, of the engineer type, of the naval-officer type,\r\nof the skilled sergeant-instructor type, a methodical development of a\r\ncommon sentiment and a common zeal among such a body of men, is an added\r\nstrength that grows greater from the moment you call it into being. In\r\nour schools and military and naval colleges lies the proper field for\r\nexpenditure upon preparation for our ultimate triumph in war. All other\r\nwar preparation is temporary but that.\r\n\r\nThis would be obvious in any case, but what makes insistence upon it\r\npeculiarly urgent is the manifestly temporary nature of the present\r\nEuropean situation and the fact that within quite a small number of\r\nyears our war front will be turned in a direction quite other than that\r\nto which it faces now.\r\n\r\nFor a decade and more all Western Europe has been threatened by German\r\ntruculence; the German, inflamed by the victories of 1870 and 1871, has\r\npoured out his energy in preparation for war by sea and land, and it has\r\nbeen the difficult task of France and England to keep the peace with\r\nhim. The German has been the provocator and leader of all modern\r\narmaments. But that is not going on. It is already more than half over.\r\nIf we can avert war with Germany for twenty years, we shall never have\r\nto fight Germany. In twenty years' time we shall be talking no more of\r\nsending troops to fight side by side on the frontier of France; we shall\r\nbe talking of sending troops to fight side by side with French and\r\nGermans on the frontiers of Poland.\r\n\r\nAnd the justification of that prophecy is a perfectly plain one. The\r\nGerman has filled up his country, his birth-rate falls, and the very\r\nvigour of his military and naval preparations, by raising the cost of\r\nliving, hurries it down. His birth-rate falls as ours and the\r\nFrenchman's falls, because he is nearing his maximum of population It is\r\nan inevitable consequence of his geographical conditions. But eastward\r\nof him, from his eastern boundaries to the Pacific, is a country already\r\ntoo populous to conquer, but with possibilities of further expansion\r\nthat are gigantic. The Slav will be free to increase and multiply for\r\nanother hundred years. Eastward and southward bristle the Slavs, and\r\nbehind the Slavs are the colossal possibilities of Asia.\r\n\r\nEven German vanity, even the preposterous ambitions that spring from\r\nthat brief triumph of Sedan, must awaken at last to these manifest\r\nfacts, and on the day when Germany is fully awake we may count the\r\nWestern European Armageddon as \"off\" and turn our eyes to the greater\r\nneeds that will arise beyond Germany. The old game will be over and a\r\nquite different new game will begin in international relations.\r\n\r\nDuring these last few years of worry and bluster across the North Sea we\r\nhave a little forgotten India in our calculations. As Germany faces\r\nround eastward again, as she must do before very long, we shall find\r\nIndia resuming its former central position in our ideas of international\r\npolitics. With India we may pursue one of two policies: we may keep her\r\ndivided and inefficient for war, as she is at present, and hold her and\r\nown her and defend her as a prize, or we may arm her and assist her\r\ndevelopment into a group of quasi-independent English-speaking\r\nStates--in which case she will become our partner and possibly at last\r\neven our senior partner. But that is by the way. What I am pointing out\r\nnow is that whether we fight Germany or not, a time is drawing near\r\nwhen Germany will cease to be our war objective and we shall cease to be\r\nGermany's war objective, and when there will have to be a complete\r\nrevision of our military and naval equipment in relation to those\r\nremoter, vaster Asiatic possibilities.\r\n\r\nNow that possible campaign away there, whatever its particular nature\r\nmay be, which will be shaping our military and naval policy in the year\r\n1933 or thereabouts, will certainly be quite different in its conditions\r\nfrom the possible campaign in Europe and the narrow seas which\r\ndetermines all our preparations now. We cannot contemplate throwing an\r\narmy of a million British conscripts on to the North-West Frontier of\r\nIndia, and a fleet of Super-Dreadnoughts will be ineffective either in\r\nThibet or the Baltic shallows. All our present stuff, indeed, will be on\r\nthe scrap-heap then. What will not be on the scrap-heap will be such\r\nenterprise and special science and inventive power as we have got\r\ntogether. That is versatile. That is good to have now and that will be\r\ngood to have then.\r\n\r\nEveryone nowadays seems demanding increased expenditure upon war\r\npreparation. I will follow the fashion. I will suggest that we have the\r\ncourage to restrain and even to curtail our monstrous outlay upon war\r\nmaterial and that we begin to spend lavishly upon military and naval\r\neducation and training, upon laboratories and experimental stations,\r\nupon chemical and physical research and all that makes knowledge and\r\nleading, and that we increase our expenditure upon these things as fast\r\nas we can up to ten or twelve millions a year. At present we spend about\r\neighteen and a half millions a year upon education out of our national\r\nfunds, but fourteen and a half of this, supplemented by about as much\r\nagain from local sources, is consumed in merely elementary teaching. So\r\nthat we spend only about four millions a year of public money on every\r\nsort of research and education above the simple democratic level. Nearly\r\nthirty millions for the foundations and only a seventh for the edifice\r\nof will and science! Is it any marvel that we are a badly organised\r\nnation, a nation of very widely diffused intelligence and very\r\nsecond-rate guidance and achievement? Is it any marvel that directly we\r\nare tested by such a new development as that of aeroplanes or airships\r\nwe show ourselves in comparison with the more braced-up nations of the\r\nContinent backward, unorganised unimaginative, unenterprising?\r\n\r\nOur supreme want to-day, if we are to continue a belligerent people, is\r\na greater supply of able educated men, versatile men capable of engines,\r\nof aviation, of invention, of leading and initiative. We need more\r\nlaboratories, more scholarships out of the general mass of elementary\r\nscholars, a quasi-military discipline in our colleges and a great array\r\nof new colleges, a much readier access to instruction in aviation and\r\nmilitary and naval practice. And if we are to have national service let\r\nus begin with it where it is needed most and where it is least likely to\r\ndisorganise our social and economic life; let us begin at the top. Let\r\nus begin with the educated and propertied classes and exact a couple of\r\nyears' service in a destroyer or a waterplane, or an airship, or a,\r\nresearch laboratory, or a training camp, from the sons of everybody who,\r\nlet us say, pays income tax without deductions. Let us mix with these a\r\nbig proportion--a proportion we may increase steadily--of keen\r\nscholarship men from the elementary schools. Such a braced-up class as\r\nwe should create in this way would give us the realities of military\r\npower, which are enterprise, knowledge, and invention; and at the same\r\ntime it would add to and not subtract from the economic wealth of the\r\ncommunity Make men; that is the only sane, permanent preparation for\r\nwar. So we should develop a strength and create a tradition that would\r\nnot rust nor grow old-fashioned in all the years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONTEMPORARY NOVEL\r\n\r\n\r\nCircumstances have made me think a good deal at different times about\r\nthe business of writing novels, and what it means, and is, and may be;\r\nand I was a professional critic of novels long before I wrote them. I\r\nhave been writing novels, or writing about novels, for the last twenty\r\nyears. It seems only yesterday that I wrote a review--the first long and\r\nappreciative review he had--of Mr. Joseph Conrad's \"Almayer's Folly\" in\r\nthe _Saturday Review_. When a man has focussed so much of his life upon\r\nthe novel, it is not reasonable to expect him to take too modest or\r\napologetic a view of it. I consider the novel an important and necessary\r\nthing indeed in that complicated system of uneasy adjustments and\r\nreadjustments which is modern civilisation I make very high and wide\r\nclaims for it. In many directions I do not think we can get along\r\nwithout it.\r\n\r\nNow this, I know, is not the usually received opinion. There is, I am\r\naware, the theory that the novel is wholly and solely a means of\r\nrelaxation. In spite of manifest facts, that was the dominant view of\r\nthe great period that we now in our retrospective way speak of as the\r\nVictorian, and it still survives to this day. It is the man's theory of\r\nthe novel rather than the woman's. One may call it the Weary Giant\r\ntheory. The reader is represented as a man, burthened, toiling, worn. He\r\nhas been in his office from ten to four, with perhaps only two hours'\r\ninterval at his club for lunch; or he has been playing golf; or he has\r\nbeen waiting about and voting in the House; or he has been fishing; or\r\nhe has been disputing a point of law; or writing a sermon; or doing one\r\nof a thousand other of the grave important things which constitute the\r\nsubstance of a prosperous man's life. Now at last comes the little\r\nprecious interval of leisure, and the Weary Giant takes up a book.\r\nPerhaps he is vexed: he may have been bunkered, his line may have been\r\nentangled in the trees, his favourite investment may have slumped, or\r\nthe judge have had indigestion and been extremely rude to him. He wants\r\nto forget the troublesome realities of life. He wants to be taken out of\r\nhimself, to be cheered, consoled, amused--above all, amused. He doesn't\r\nwant ideas, he doesn't want facts; above all, he doesn't\r\nwant--_Problems_. He wants to dream of the bright, thin, gay excitements\r\nof a phantom world--in which he can be hero--of horses ridden and lace\r\nworn and princesses rescued and won. He wants pictures of funny slums,\r\nand entertaining paupers, and laughable longshoremen, and kindly\r\nimpulses making life sweet. He wants romance without its defiance, and\r\nhumour without its sting; and the business of the novelist, he holds, is\r\nto supply this cooling refreshment. That is the Weary Giant theory of\r\nthe novel. It ruled British criticism up to the period of the Boer\r\nwar--and then something happened to quite a lot of us, and it has never\r\ncompletely recovered its old predominance. Perhaps it will; perhaps\r\nsomething else may happen to prevent its ever doing so.\r\n\r\nBoth fiction and criticism to-day are in revolt against that tired\r\ngiant, the prosperous Englishman. I cannot think of a single writer of\r\nany distinction to-day, unless it is Mr. W.W. Jacobs, who is content\r\nmerely to serve the purpose of those slippered hours. So far from the\r\nweary reader being a decently tired giant, we realise that he is only an\r\ninexpressibly lax, slovenly and under-trained giant, and we are all out\r\nwith one accord resolved to exercise his higher ganglia in every\r\npossible way. And so I will say no more of the idea that the novel is\r\nmerely a harmless opiate for the vacant hours of prosperous men. As a\r\nmatter of fact, it never has been, and by its nature I doubt if it ever\r\ncan be.\r\n\r\nI do not think that women have ever quite succumbed to the tired giant\r\nattitude in their reading. Women are more serious, not only about life,\r\nbut about books. No type or kind of woman is capable of that lounging,\r\ndefensive stupidity which is the basis of the tired giant attitude, and\r\nall through the early 'nineties, during which the respectable frivolity\r\nof Great Britain left its most enduring marks upon our literature, there\r\nwas a rebel undertow of earnest and aggressive writing and reading,\r\nsupported chiefly by women and supplied very largely by women, which\r\ngave the lie to the prevailing trivial estimate of fiction. Among\r\nreaders, women and girls and young men at least will insist upon having\r\ntheir novels significant and real, and it is to these perpetually\r\nrenewed elements in the public that the novelist must look for his\r\ncontinuing emancipation from the wearier and more massive influences at\r\nwork in contemporary British life.\r\n\r\nAnd if the novel is to be recognised as something more than a\r\nrelaxation, it has also, I think, to be kept free from the restrictions\r\nimposed upon it by the fierce pedantries of those who would define a\r\ngeneral form for it. Every art nowadays must steer its way between the\r\nrocks of trivial and degrading standards and the whirlpool of arbitrary\r\nand irrational criticism. Whenever criticism of any art becomes\r\nspecialised and professional whenever a class of adjudicators is brought\r\ninto existence, those adjudicators are apt to become as a class\r\ndistrustful of their immediate impressions, and anxious for methods of\r\ncomparison between work and work, they begin to emulate the\r\nclassifications and exact measurements of a science, and to set up\r\nideals and rules as data for such classification and measurements. They\r\ndevelop an alleged sense of technique, which is too often no more than\r\nthe attempt to exact a laboriousness of method, or to insist upon\r\npeculiarities of method which impress the professional critic not so\r\nmuch as being merits as being meritorious. This sort of thing has gone\r\nvery far with the critical discussion both of the novel and the play.\r\nYou have all heard that impressive dictum that some particular\r\ntheatrical display, although moving, interesting, and continually\r\nentertaining from start to finish, was for occult technical reasons \"not\r\na play,\" and in the same way you are continually having your\r\nappreciation of fiction dashed by the mysterious parallel condemnation,\r\nthat the story you like \"isn't a novel.\" The novel has been treated as\r\nthough its form was as well-defined as the sonnet. Some year or so ago,\r\nfor example, there was a quite serious discussion, which began, I\r\nbelieve, in a weekly paper devoted to the interests of various\r\nnonconformist religious organisations, about the proper length for a\r\nnovel. The critic was to begin his painful duties with a yard measure.\r\nThe matter was taken up with profound gravity by the _Westminster\r\nGazette_, and a considerable number of literary men and women were\r\ncircularised and asked to state, in the face of \"Tom Jones,\" \"The Vicar\r\nof Wakefield,\" \"The Shabby-Genteel Story,\" and \"Bleak House,\" just\r\nexactly how long the novel ought to be. Our replies varied according to\r\nthe civility of our natures, but the mere attempt to raise the question\r\nshows, I think, how widespread among the editorial, paragraph-writing,\r\nopinion-making sort of people is this notion of prescribing a definite\r\nlength and a definite form for the novel. In the newspaper\r\ncorrespondence that followed, our friend the weary giant made a\r\ntransitory appearance again. We were told the novel ought to be long\r\nenough for him to take up after dinner and finish before his whisky at\r\neleven.\r\n\r\nThat was obviously a half-forgotten echo of Edgar Allan Poe's discussion\r\nof the short story. Edgar Allan Poe was very definite upon the point\r\nthat the short story should be finished at a sitting. But the novel and\r\nshort story are two entirely different things, and the train of\r\nreasoning that made the American master limit the short story to about\r\nan hour of reading as a maximum, does not apply to the longer work. A\r\nshort story is, or should be, a simple thing; it aims at producing one\r\nsingle, vivid effect; it has to seize the attention at the outset, and\r\nnever relaxing, gather it together more and more until the climax is\r\nreached. The limits of the human capacity to attend closely therefore\r\nset a limit to it; it must explode and finish before interruption occurs\r\nor fatigue sets in. But the novel I hold to be a discursive thing; it is\r\nnot a single interest, but a woven tapestry of interests; one is drawn\r\non first by this affection and curiosity, and then by that; it is\r\nsomething to return to, and I do not see that we can possibly set any\r\nlimit to its extent. The distinctive value of the novel among written\r\nworks of art is in characterisation, and the charm of a well-conceived\r\ncharacter lies, not in knowing its destiny, but in watching its\r\nproceedings. For my own part, I will confess that I find all the novels\r\nof Dickens, long as they are, too short for me. I am sorry they do not\r\nflow into one another more than they do. I wish Micawber and Dick\r\nSwiveller and Sairey Gamp turned up again in other novels than their\r\nown, just as Shakespeare ran the glorious glow of Falstaff through a\r\ngroup of plays. But Dickens tried this once when he carried on the\r\nPickwick Club into \"Master Humphrey's Clock.\" That experiment was\r\nunsatisfactory, and he did not attempt anything of the sort again.\r\nFollowing on the days of Dickens, the novel began to contract, to\r\nsubordinate characterisation to story and description to drama;\r\nconsiderations of a sordid nature, I am told, had to do with that;\r\nsomething about a guinea and a half and six shillings with which we will\r\nnot concern ourselves--but I rejoice to see many signs to-day that that\r\nphase of narrowing and restriction is over, and that there is every\r\nencouragement for a return towards a laxer, more spacious form of\r\nnovel-writing. The movement is partly of English origin, a revolt\r\nagainst those more exacting and cramping conceptions of artistic\r\nperfection to which I will recur in a moment, and a return to the lax\r\nfreedom of form, the rambling discursiveness, the right to roam, of the\r\nearlier English novel, of \"Tristram Shandy\" and of \"Tom Jones\"; and\r\npartly it comes from abroad, and derives a stimulus from such bold and\r\noriginal enterprises as that of Monsieur Rolland in his \"Jean\r\nChristophe.\" Its double origin involves a double nature; for while the\r\nEnglish spirit is towards discursiveness and variety, the new French\r\nmovement is rather towards exhaustiveness. Mr. Arnold Bennett has\r\nexperimented in both forms of amplitude. His superb \"Old Wives' Tale,\"\r\nwandering from person to person and from scene to scene, is by far the\r\nfinest \"long novel\" that has been written in English in the English\r\nfashion in this generation, and now in \"Clayhanger\" and its promised\r\ncollaterals, he undertakes that complete, minute, abundant presentation\r\nof the growth and modification of one or two individual minds, which is\r\nthe essential characteristic of the Continental movement towards the\r\nnovel of amplitude. While the \"Old Wives' Tale\" is discursive,\r\n\"Clayhanger\" is exhaustive; he gives us both types of the new movement\r\nin perfection.\r\n\r\nI name \"Jean Christophe\" as a sort of archetype in this connection,\r\nbecause it is just at present very much in our thoughts by reason of the\r\nadmirable translation Mr. Cannan is giving us; but there is a greater\r\npredecessor to this comprehensive and spectacular treatment of a single\r\nmind and its impressions and ideas, or of one or two associated minds,\r\nthat comes to us now _via_ Mr. Bennett and Mr. Cannan from France. The\r\ngreat original of all this work is that colossal last unfinished book of\r\nFlaubert, \"Bouvard et P\u00e9cuchet.\" Flaubert, the bulk of whose life was\r\nspent upon the most austere and restrained fiction--Turgenev was not\r\nmore austere and restrained--broke out at last into this gay, sad\r\nmiracle of intellectual abundance. It is not extensively read in this\r\ncountry; it is not yet, I believe, translated into English; but there it\r\nis--and if it is new to the reader I make him this present of the secret\r\nof a book that is a precious wilderness of wonderful reading. But if\r\nFlaubert is really the Continental emancipator of the novel from the\r\nrestrictions of form, the master to whom we of the English persuasion,\r\nwe of the discursive school, must for ever recur is he, whom I will\r\nmaintain against all comers to be the subtlest and greatest _artist_--I\r\nlay stress upon that word artist--that Great Britain has ever produced\r\nin all that is essentially the novel, Laurence Sterne....\r\n\r\nThe confusion between the standards of a short story and the standards\r\nof the novel which leads at last to these--what shall I call\r\nthem?--_Westminster Gazettisms?_--about the correct length to which the\r\nnovelist should aspire, leads also to all kinds of absurd condemnations\r\nand exactions upon matters of method and style. The underlying fallacy\r\nis always this: the assumption that the novel, like the story, aims at a\r\nsingle, concentrated impression. From that comes a fertile growth of\r\nerror. Constantly one finds in the reviews of works of fiction the\r\ncomplaint that this, that or the other thing in a novel is irrelevant.\r\nNow it is the easiest thing, and most fatal thing, to become irrelevant\r\nin a short story. A short story should go to its point as a man flies\r\nfrom a pursuing tiger: he pauses not for the daisies in his path, or to\r\nnote the pretty moss on the tree he climbs for safety. But the novel by\r\ncomparison is like breakfasting in the open air on a summer morning;\r\nnothing is irrelevant if the waiter's mood is happy, and the tapping of\r\nthe thrush upon the garden path, or the petal of apple-blossom that\r\nfloats down into my coffee, is as relevant as the egg I open or the\r\nbread and butter I bite. And all sorts of things that inevitably mar the\r\ntense illusion which is the aim of the short story--the introduction,\r\nfor example, of the author's personality--any comment that seems to\r\nadmit that, after all, fiction is fiction, a change in manner between\r\npart and part, burlesque, parody, invective, all such thing's are not\r\nnecessarily wrong in the novel. Of course, all these things may fail in\r\ntheir effect; they may jar, hinder, irritate, and all are difficult to\r\ndo well; but it is no artistic merit to evade a difficulty any more than\r\nit is a merit in a hunter to refuse even the highest of fences. Nearly\r\nall the novels that have, by the lapse of time, reached an assured\r\nposition of recognised greatness, are not only saturated in the\r\npersonality of the author, but have in addition quite unaffected\r\npersonal outbreaks. The least successful instance the one that is made\r\nthe text against all such first-personal interventions, is, of course,\r\nThackeray. But I think the trouble with Thackeray is not that he makes\r\nfirst-personal interventions, but that he does so with a curious touch\r\nof dishonesty. I agree with the late Mrs. Craigie that there was\r\nsomething profoundly vulgar about Thackeray. It was a sham thoughtful,\r\nsham man-of-the-world pose he assumed; it is an aggressive, conscious,\r\nchallenging person astride before a fire, and a little distended by\r\ndinner and a sense of social and literary precedences, who uses the\r\nfirst person in Thackeray's novels. It isn't the real Thackeray; it\r\nisn't a frank man who looks you in the eyes and bares his soul and\r\ndemands your sympathy. That is a criticism of Thackeray, but it isn't a\r\ncondemnation of intervention.\r\n\r\nI admit that for a novelist to come in person in this way before his\r\nreaders involves grave risks; but when it is done without affectations,\r\nstarkly as a man comes in out of the darkness to tell of perplexing\r\nthings without--as, for instance, Mr. Joseph Conrad does for all\r\npractical purposes in his \"Lord Jim\"--then it gives a sort of depth, a\r\nsort of subjective reality, that no such cold, almost affectedly\r\nironical detachment as that which distinguishes the work of Mr. John\r\nGalsworthy, for example, can ever attain. And in some cases the whole\r\nart and delight of a novel may lie in the author's personal\r\ninterventions; let such novels as \"Elizabeth and her German Garden,\" and\r\nthe same writer's \"Elizabeth in R\u00fcgen,\" bear witness.\r\n\r\nNow, all this time I have been hacking away at certain hampering and\r\nlimiting beliefs about the novel, letting it loose, as it were, in form\r\nand purpose; I have still to say just what I think the novel is, and\r\nwhere, if anywhere, its boundary-line ought to be drawn. It is by no\r\nmeans an easy task to define the novel. It is not a thing premeditated.\r\nIt is a thing that has grown up into modern life, and taken upon itself\r\nuses and produced results that could not have been foreseen by its\r\noriginators. Few of the important things in the collective life of man\r\nstarted out to be what they are. Consider, for example, all the\r\nunexpected aesthetic values, the inspiration and variety of emotional\r\nresult which arises out of the cross-shaped plan of the Gothic\r\ncathedral, and the undesigned delight and wonder of white marble that\r\nhas ensued, as I have been told, through the ageing and whitening of the\r\nrealistically coloured statuary of the Greeks and Romans. Much of the\r\ncharm of the old furniture and needlework, again, upon which the present\r\ntime sets so much store, lies in acquired and unpremeditated qualities.\r\nAnd no doubt the novel grew up out of simple story-telling, and the\r\nuniversal desire of children, old and young alike, for a story. It is\r\nonly slowly that we have developed the distinction of the novel from the\r\nromance, as being a story of human beings, absolutely credible and\r\nconceivable as distinguished from human beings frankly endowed with the\r\nglamour, the wonder, the brightness, of a less exacting and more vividly\r\neventful world. The novel is a story that demands, or professes to\r\ndemand, no make-believe. The novelist undertakes to present you people\r\nand things as real as any that you can meet in an omnibus. And I suppose\r\nit is conceivable that a novel might exist which was just purely a story\r\nof that kind and nothing more. It might amuse you as one is amused by\r\nlooking out of a window into a street, or listening to a piece of\r\nagreeable music, and that might be the limit of its effect. But almost\r\nalways the novel is something more than that, and produces more effect\r\nthan that. The novel has inseparable moral consequences. It leaves\r\nimpressions, not simply of things seen, but of acts judged and made\r\nattractive or unattractive. They may prove very slight moral\r\nconsequences, and very shallow moral impressions in the long run, but\r\nthere they are, none the less, its inevitable accompaniments. It is\r\nunavoidable that this should be so. Even if the novelist attempts or\r\naffects to be impartial, he still cannot prevent his characters setting\r\nexamples; he still cannot avoid, as people say, putting ideas into his\r\nreaders' heads. The greater his skill, the more convincing his treatment\r\nthe more vivid his power of suggestion. And it is equally impossible for\r\nhim not to betray his sense that the proceedings of this person are\r\nrather jolly and admirable, and of that, rather ugly and detestable. I\r\nsuppose Mr. Bennett, for example, would say that he should not do so;\r\nbut it is as manifest to any disinterested observer that he greatly\r\nloves and admires his Card, as that Richardson admired his Sir Charles\r\nGrandison, or that Mrs. Humphry Ward considers her Marcella a very fine\r\nand estimable young woman. And I think it is just in this, that the\r\nnovel is not simply a fictitious record of conduct, but also a study and\r\njudgment of conduct, and through that of the ideas that lead to conduct,\r\nthat the real and increasing value--or perhaps to avoid controversy I\r\nhad better say the real and increasing importance--of the novel and of\r\nthe novelist in modern life comes in.\r\n\r\nIt is no new discovery that the novel, like the drama, is a powerful\r\ninstrument of moral suggestion. This has been understood in England ever\r\nsince there has been such a thing as a novel in England. This has been\r\nrecognised equally by novelists, novel-readers, and the people who\r\nwouldn't read novels under any condition whatever. Richardson wrote\r\ndeliberately for edification, and \"Tom Jones\" is a powerful and\r\neffective appeal for a charitable, and even indulgent, attitude towards\r\nloose-living men. But excepting Fielding and one or two other of those\r\npartial exceptions that always occur in the case of critical\r\ngeneralisations, there is a definable difference between the novel of\r\nthe past and what I may call the modern novel. It is a difference that\r\nis reflected upon the novel from a difference in the general way of\r\nthinking. It lies in the fact that formerly there was a feeling of\r\ncertitude about moral values and standards of conduct that is altogether\r\nabsent to-day. It wasn't so much that men were agreed upon these\r\nthings--about these things there have always been enormous divergences\r\nof opinion--as that men were emphatic, cocksure, and unteachable about\r\nwhatever they did happen to believe to a degree that no longer obtains.\r\nThis is the Balfourian age, and even religion seeks to establish itself\r\non doubt. There were, perhaps, just as many differences in the past as\r\nthere are now, but the outlines were harder--they were, indeed, so hard\r\nas to be almost, to our sense, savage. You might be a Roman Catholic,\r\nand in that case you did not want to hear about Protestants, Turks,\r\nInfidels, except in tones of horror and hatred. You knew exactly what\r\nwas good and what was evil. Your priest informed you upon these points,\r\nand all you needed in any novel you read was a confirmation, implicit or\r\nexplicit, of these vivid, rather than charming, prejudices. If you were\r\na Protestant you were equally clear and unshakable. Your sect, whichever\r\nsect you belonged to, knew the whole of truth and included all the nice\r\npeople. It had nothing to learn in the world, and it wanted to learn\r\nnothing outside its sectarian convictions. The unbelievers you know,\r\nwere just as bad, and said their creeds with an equal fury--merely\r\ninterpolating _nots_. People of every sort--Catholic, Protestant,\r\nInfidel, or what not--were equally clear that good was good and bad was\r\nbad, that the world was made up of good characters whom you had to love,\r\nhelp and admire, and of bad characters to whom one might, in the\r\ninterests of goodness, even lie, and whom one had to foil, defeat and\r\ntriumph over shamelessly at every opportunity. That was the quality of\r\nthe times. The novel reflected this quality of assurance, and its utmost\r\ncharity was to unmask an apparent villain and show that he or she was\r\nreally profoundly and correctly good, or to unmask an apparent saint\r\nand show the hypocrite. There was no such penetrating and pervading\r\nelement of doubt and curiosity--and charity, about the rightfulness and\r\nbeauty of conduct, such as one meets on every hand to-day.\r\n\r\nThe novel-reader of the past, therefore, like the novel-reader of the\r\nmore provincial parts of England to-day, judged a novel by the\r\nconvictions that had been built up in him by his training and his priest\r\nor his pastor. If it agreed with these convictions he approved; if it\r\ndid not agree he disapproved--often with great energy. The novel, where\r\nit was not unconditionally banned altogether as a thing disturbing and\r\nunnecessary, was regarded as a thing subordinated to the teaching of the\r\npriest or pastor, or whatever director and dogma was followed. Its\r\nmodest moral confirmations began when authority had completed its\r\ndirection. The novel was good--if it seemed to harmonise with the graver\r\nexercises conducted by Mr. Chadband--and it was bad and outcast if Mr.\r\nChadband said so. And it is over the bodies of discredited and\r\ndisgruntled Chadbands that the novel escapes from its servitude and\r\ninferiority.\r\n\r\nNow the conflict of authority against criticism is one of the eternal\r\nconflicts of humanity. It is the conflict of organisation against\r\ninitiative, of discipline against freedom. It was the conflict of the\r\npriest against the prophet in ancient Judaea, of the Pharisee against\r\nthe Nazarene, of the Realist against the Nominalist, of the Church\r\nagainst the Franciscan and the Lollard, of the Respectable Person\r\nagainst the Artist, of the hedge-clippers of mankind against the\r\nshooting buds. And to-day, while we live in a period of tightening and\r\nextending social organisation, we live also in a period of adventurous\r\nand insurgent thought, in an intellectual spring unprecedented in the\r\nworld's history. There is an enormous criticism going on of the faiths\r\nupon which men's lives and associations are based, and of every standard\r\nand rule of conduct. And it is inevitable that the novel, just in the\r\nmeasure of its sincerity and ability, should reflect and co-operate in\r\nthe atmosphere and uncertainties and changing variety of this seething\r\nand creative time.\r\n\r\nAnd I do not mean merely that the novel is unavoidably charged with the\r\nrepresentation of this wide and wonderful conflict. It is a necessary\r\npart of the conflict. The essential characteristic of this great\r\nintellectual revolution amidst which we are living to-day, that\r\nrevolution of which the revival and restatement of nominalism under the\r\nname of pragmatism is the philosophical aspect, consists in the\r\nreassertion of the importance of the individual instance as against the\r\ngeneralisation. All our social, political, moral problems are being\r\napproached in a new spirit, in an inquiring and experimental spirit,\r\nwhich has small respect for abstract principles and deductive rules. We\r\nperceive more and more clearly, for example, that the study of social\r\norganisation is an empty and unprofitable study until we approach it as\r\na study of the association and inter-reaction of individualised human\r\nbeings inspired by diversified motives, ruled by traditions, and swayed\r\nby the suggestions of a complex intellectual atmosphere. And all our\r\nconceptions of the relationships between man and man, and of justice and\r\nrightfulness and social desirableness, remain something misfitting and\r\ninappropriate, something uncomfortable and potentially injurious, as if\r\nwe were trying to wear sharp-edged clothes made for a giant out of tin,\r\nuntil we bring them to the test and measure of realised individualities.\r\n\r\nAnd this is where the value and opportunity of the modern novel comes\r\nin. So far as I can see, it is the only medium through which we can\r\ndiscuss the great majority of the problems which are being raised in\r\nsuch bristling multitude by our contemporary social development Nearly\r\nevery one of those problems has at its core a psychological problem, and\r\nnot merely a psychological problem, but one in which the idea of\r\nindividuality is an essential factor. Dealing with most of these\r\nquestions by a rule or a generalisation is like putting a cordon round a\r\njungle full of the most diversified sort of game. The hunting only\r\nbegins when you leave the cordon behind you and push into the thickets.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, the immense cluster of difficulties that arises out\r\nof the increasing complexity of our state. On every hand we are creating\r\nofficials, and compared with only a few years ago the private life in a\r\ndozen fresh directions comes into contact with officialdom. But we still\r\ndo practically nothing to work out the interesting changes that occur in\r\nthis sort of man and that, when you withdraw him as it were from the\r\ncommon crowd of humanity, put his mind if not his body into uniform and\r\nendow him with powers and functions and rules. It is manifestly a study\r\nof the profoundest public and personal importance. It is manifestly a\r\nstudy of increasing importance. The process of social and political\r\norganisation that has been going on for the last quarter of a century is\r\npretty clearly going on now if anything with increasing vigour--and for\r\nthe most part the entire dependence of the consequences of the whole\r\nproblem upon the reaction between the office on the one hand and the\r\nweak, uncertain, various human beings who take office on the other,\r\ndoesn't seem even to be suspected by the energetic, virtuous and more or\r\nless amiable people whose activities in politics and upon the backstairs\r\nof politics bring about these developments. They assume that the sort of\r\nofficial they need, a combination of god-like virtue and intelligence\r\nwith unfailing mechanical obedience, can be made out of just any young\r\nnephew. And I know of no means of persuading people that this is a\r\nrather unjustifiable assumption, and of creating an intelligent\r\ncontrolling criticism of officials and of assisting conscientious\r\nofficials to an effective self-examination, and generally of keeping the\r\natmosphere of official life sweet and healthy, except the novel. Yet so\r\nfar the novel has scarcely begun its attack upon this particular field\r\nof human life, and all the attractive varied play of motive it contains.\r\n\r\nOf course we have one supreme and devastating study of the illiterate\r\nminor official in Bumble. That one figure lit up and still lights the\r\nwhole problem of Poor Law administration for the English reading\r\ncommunity. It was a translation of well-meant regulations and\r\npseudo-scientific conceptions of social order into blundering, arrogant,\r\nill-bred flesh and blood. It was worth a hundred Royal Commissions. You\r\nmay make your regulations as you please, said Dickens in effect; this is\r\none sample of the stuff that will carry them out. But Bumble stands\r\nalmost alone. Instead of realising that he is only one aspect of\r\nofficialdom, we are all too apt to make him the type of all officials,\r\nand not an urban district council can get into a dispute about its\r\nelectric light without being denounced as a Bumbledom by some whirling\r\nenemy or other. The burthen upon Bumble's shoulders is too heavy to be\r\nborne, and we want the contemporary novel to give us a score of other\r\nfigures to put beside him, other aspects and reflections upon this great\r\nproblem of officialism made flesh. Bumble is a magnificent figure of the\r\nfollies and cruelties of ignorance in office--I would have every\r\ncandidate for the post of workhouse master pass a severe examination\r\nupon \"Oliver Twist\"--but it is not only caricature and satire I demand.\r\nWe must have not only the fullest treatment of the temptations,\r\nvanities, abuses, and absurdities of office, but all its dreams, its\r\nsense of constructive order, its consolations, its sense of service, and\r\nits nobler satisfactions. You may say that is demanding more insight and\r\npower in our novels and novelists than we can possibly hope to find in\r\nthem. So much the worse for us. I stick to my thesis that the\r\ncomplicated social organisation of to-day cannot get along without the\r\namount of mutual understanding and mutual explanation such a range of\r\ncharacterisation in our novels implies. The success of civilisation\r\namounts ultimately to a success of sympathy and understanding. If people\r\ncannot be brought to an interest in one another greater than they feel\r\nto-day, to curiosities and criticisms far keener, and co-operations far\r\nsubtler, than we have now; if class cannot be brought to measure itself\r\nagainst, and interchange experience and sympathy with class, and\r\ntemperament with temperament then we shall never struggle very far\r\nbeyond the confused discomforts and uneasiness of to-day, and the\r\nchanges and complications of human life will remain as they are now,\r\nvery like the crumplings and separations and complications of an immense\r\navalanche that is sliding down a hill. And in this tremendous work of\r\nhuman reconciliation and elucidation, it seems to me it is the novel\r\nthat must attempt most and achieve most.\r\n\r\nYou may feel disposed to say to all this: We grant the major premises,\r\nbut why look to the work of prose fiction as the main instrument in this\r\nnecessary process of, so to speak, sympathising humanity together?\r\nCannot this be done far more effectively through biography and\r\nautobiography, for example? Isn't there the lyric; and, above all, isn't\r\nthere the play? Well, so far as the stage goes, I think it is a very\r\ncharming and exciting form of human activity, a display of actions and\r\nsurprises of the most moving and impressive sort; but beyond the\r\nopportunity it affords for saying startling and thought-provoking\r\nthings--opportunities Mr. Shaw, for example, has worked to the utmost\r\nlimit--I do not see that the drama does much to enlarge our sympathies\r\nand add to our stock of motive ideas. And regarded as a medium for\r\nstartling and thought-provoking things, the stage seems to me an\r\nextremely clumsy and costly affair. One might just as well go about with\r\na pencil writing up the thought-provoking phrase, whatever it is, on\r\nwalls. The drama excites our sympathies intensely, but it seems to me it\r\nis far too objective a medium to widen them appreciably, and it is that\r\nwidening, that increase in the range of understanding, at which I think\r\ncivilisation is aiming. The case for biography, and more particularly\r\nautobiography, as against the novel, is, I admit, at the first blush\r\nstronger. You may say: Why give us these creatures of a novelist's\r\nimagination, these phantom and fantastic thinkings and doings, when we\r\nmay have the stories of real lives, really lived--the intimate record of\r\nactual men and women? To which one answers: \"Ah, if one could!\" But it\r\nis just because biography does deal with actual lives, actual facts,\r\nbecause it radiates out to touch continuing interests and sensitive\r\nsurvivors, that it is so unsatisfactory, so untruthful. Its inseparable\r\nfalsehood is the worst of all kinds of falsehood--the falsehood of\r\nomission. Think what an abounding, astonishing, perplexing person\r\nGladstone must have been in life, and consider Lord Morley's \"Life of\r\nGladstone,\" cold, dignified--not a life at all, indeed, so much as\r\nembalmed remains; the fire gone, the passions gone, the bowels carefully\r\nremoved. All biography has something of that post-mortem coldness and\r\nrespect, and as for autobiography--a man may show his soul in a thousand\r\nhalf-conscious ways, but to turn upon oneself and explain oneself is\r\ngiven to no one. It is the natural liars and braggarts, your Cellinis\r\nand Casanovas, men with a habit of regarding themselves with a kind of\r\nobjective admiration, who do best in autobiography. And, on the other\r\nhand, the novel has neither the intense self-consciousness of\r\nautobiography nor the paralysing responsibilities of the biographer. It\r\nis by comparison irresponsible and free. Because its characters are\r\nfigments and phantoms, they can be made entirely transparent. Because\r\nthey are fictions, and you know they are fictions, so that they cannot\r\nhold you for an instant so soon as they cease to be true, they have a\r\npower of veracity quite beyond that of actual records. Every novel\r\ncarries its own justification and its own condemnation in its success or\r\nfailure to convince you that _the thing was so_. Now history, biography,\r\nblue-book and so forth, can hardly ever get beyond the statement that\r\nthe superficial fact was so.\r\n\r\nYou see now the scope of the claim I am making for the novel; it is to\r\nbe the social mediator, the vehicle of understanding, the instrument of\r\nself-examination, the parade of morals and the exchange of manners, the\r\nfactory of customs, the criticism of laws and institutions and of social\r\ndogmas and ideas. It is to be the home confessional, the initiator of\r\nknowledge, the seed of fruitful self-questioning. Let me be very clear\r\nhere. I do not mean for a moment that the novelist is going to set up as\r\na teacher, as a sort of priest with a pen, who will make men and women\r\nbelieve and do this and that. The novel is not a new sort of pulpit;\r\nhumanity is passing out of the phase when men _sit under_ preachers and\r\ndogmatic influences. But the novelist is going to be the most potent of\r\nartists, because he is going to present conduct, devise beautiful\r\nconduct, discuss conduct analyse conduct, suggest conduct, illuminate it\r\nthrough and through. He will not teach, but discuss, point out, plead,\r\nand display. And this being my view you will be prepared for the demand\r\nI am now about to make for an absolutely free hand for the novelist in\r\nhis choice of topic and incident and in his method of treatment; or\r\nrather, if I may presume to speak for other novelists, I would say it is\r\nnot so much a demand we make as an intention we proclaim. We are going\r\nto write, subject only to our limitations, about the whole of human\r\nlife. We are going to deal with political questions and religious\r\nquestions and social questions. We cannot present people unless we have\r\nthis free hand, this unrestricted field. What is the good of telling\r\nstories about people's lives if one may not deal freely with the\r\nreligious beliefs and organisations that have controlled or failed to\r\ncontrol them? What is the good of pretending to write about love, and\r\nthe loyalties and treacheries and quarrels of men and women, if one must\r\nnot glance at those varieties of physical temperament and organic\r\nquality, those deeply passionate needs and distresses from which half\r\nthe storms of human life are brewed? We mean to deal with all these\r\nthings, and it will need very much more than the disapproval of\r\nprovincial librarians, the hostility of a few influential people in\r\nLondon, the scurrility of one paper, and the deep and obstinate silences\r\nof another, to stop the incoming tide of aggressive novel-writing. We\r\nare going to write about it all. We are going to write about business\r\nand finance and politics and precedence and pretentiousness and decorum\r\nand indecorum, until a thousand pretences and ten thousand impostures\r\nshrivel in the cold, clear air of our elucidations. We are going to\r\nwrite of wasted opportunities and latent beauties until a thousand new\r\nways of living open to men and women. We are going to appeal to the\r\nyoung and the hopeful and the curious, against the established, the\r\ndignified, and defensive. Before we have done, we will have all life\r\nwithin the scope of the novel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHILOSOPHER'S PUBLIC LIBRARY\r\n\r\n\r\nSuppose a philosopher had a great deal of money to spend--though this is\r\nnot in accordance with experience, it is not inherently impossible--and\r\nsuppose he thought, as any philosopher does think, that the British\r\npublic ought to read much more and better books than they do, and that\r\nfounding public libraries was the way to induce them to do so, what sort\r\nof public libraries would he found? That, I submit, is a suitable topic\r\nfor a disinterested speculator.\r\n\r\nHe would, I suppose, being a philosopher, begin by asking himself what a\r\nlibrary essentially was, and he would probably come to the eccentric\r\nconclusion that it was essentially a collection of books. He would, in\r\nhis unworldliness, entirely overlook the fact that it might be a job for\r\na municipally influential builder, a costly but conspicuous monument to\r\nopulent generosity, a news-room, an employment bureau, or a\r\nmeeting-place for the glowing young; he would never think for a moment\r\nof a library as a thing one might build, it would present itself to him\r\nwith astonishing simplicity as a thing one would collect. Bricks ceased\r\nto be literature after Babylon.\r\n\r\nHis first proceeding would be, I suppose, to make a list of that\r\ncollection. What books, he would say, have all my libraries to possess\r\nanyhow? And he would begin to jot down--with the assistance of a few\r\nfriends, perhaps--this essential list.\r\n\r\nHe would, being a philosopher, insist on good editions, and he would\r\nalso take great pains with the selection. It would not be a limited or\r\nan exclusive list--when in doubt he would include. He would disregard\r\nmodern fiction very largely, because any book that has any success can\r\nalways be bought for sixpence, and modern poetry, because, with an\r\nexception or so, it does not signify at all. He would set almost all the\r\nGreek and Roman literature in well-printed translations and with\r\nluminous introductions--and if there were no good translations he would\r\ngive some good man \u00a3500 or so to make one--translations of all that is\r\ngood in modern European literatures, and, last but largest portion of\r\nhis list, editions of all that is worthy of our own. He would make a\r\nvery careful list of thoroughly modern encyclopaedias, atlases, and\r\nvolumes of information, and a particularly complete catalogue of all\r\nliterature that is still copyright; and then--with perhaps a secretary\r\nor so--he would revise all his lists and mark against every book whether\r\nhe would have two, five or ten or twenty copies, or whatever number of\r\ncopies of it he thought proper in each library.\r\n\r\nThen next, being a philosopher, he would decide that if he was going to\r\nbuy a great number of libraries in this way, he was going to make an\r\nabsolutely new sort of demand for these books, and that he was entitled\r\nto a special sort of supply.\r\n\r\nHe would not expect the machinery of retail book-selling to meet the\r\nneeds of wholesale buying. So he would go either to wholesale\r\nbooksellers, or directly to the various publishers of the books and\r\neditions he had chosen, and ask for reasonable special prices for the\r\ntwo thousand or seven thousand or fifty thousand of each book he\r\nrequired. And the publishers would, of course, give him very special\r\nprices, more especially in the case of the out-of-copyright books. He\r\nwould probably find it best to buy whole editions in sheets and bind\r\nthem himself in strong bindings. And he would emerge from these\r\nnegotiations in possession of a number of complete libraries each\r\nof--how many books? Less than twenty thousand ought to do it, I think,\r\nthough that is a matter for separate discussion, and that should cost\r\nhim, buying in this wholesale way, under rather than over \u00a32,000 a\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nAnd next he would bethink himself of the readers of these books. \"These\r\npeople,\" he would say, \"do not know very much about books, which,\r\nindeed, is why I am giving them this library.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, he would get a number of able and learned people to write\r\nhim guides to his twenty thousand books, and, in fact, to the whole\r\nworld of reading, a guide, for example, to the books on history in\r\ngeneral, a special guide to books on English history, or French or\r\nGerman history, a guide to the books on geology, a guide to poetry and\r\npoetical criticisms, and so forth.\r\n\r\nSome such books our philosopher would find already done--the\r\n\"Bibliography of American History,\" of the American Libraries'\r\nAssociation, for example, and Mr. Nield's \"Guide to Historical\r\nFiction\"--and what are not done he would commission good men to do for\r\nhim. Suppose he had to commission forty such guides altogether and that\r\nthey cost him on the average \u00a3500 each, for he would take care not to\r\nsweat their makers, then that would add another \u00a320,000 to his\r\nexpenditure. But if he was going to found 400 libraries, let us say,\r\nthat would only be \u00a350 a library--a very trivial addition to his\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\nThe rarer books mentioned in these various guides would remind him,\r\nhowever, of the many even his ample limit of twenty thousand forced him\r\nto exclude, and he would, perhaps, consider the need of having two or\r\nthree libraries each for the storage of a hundred thousand books or so\r\nnot kept at the local libraries, but which could be sent to them at a\r\nday's notice at the request of any reader. And then, and only then,\r\nwould he give his attention to the housing and staffing that this\r\nreality of books would demand.\r\n\r\nBeing a philosopher and no fool, he would draw a very clear, hard\r\ndistinction between the reckless endowment of the building trade and the\r\ndissemination of books. He would distinguish, too, between a library and\r\na news-room, and would find no great attraction in the prospect of\r\nsupplying the national youth with free but thumby copies of the sixpenny\r\nmagazines. He would consider that all that was needed for his library\r\nwas, first, easily accessible fireproof shelving for his collection,\r\nwith ample space for his additions, an efficient distributing office, a\r\ncloak-room, and so forth, and eight or nine not too large, well lit,\r\nwell carpeted, well warmed and well ventilated rooms radiating from that\r\noffice, in which the guides and so forth could be consulted, and where\r\nthose who had no convenient, quiet room at home could read.\r\n\r\nHe would find that, by avoiding architectural vulgarities, a simple,\r\nwell proportioned building satisfying all these requirements and\r\ncontaining housing for the librarian, assistant, custodian and staff\r\ncould be built for between \u00a34,000 and \u00a35,000, excluding the cost of\r\nsite, and his sites, which he would not choose for their\r\nconspicuousness, might average something under another \u00a31,000.\r\n\r\nHe would try to make a bargain with the local people for their\r\nco-operation in his enterprise, though he would, as a philosopher,\r\nunderstand that where a public library is least wanted it is generally\r\nmost needed. But in most cases he would succeed in stipulating for a\r\ncertain standard of maintenance by the local authority. Since moderately\r\nprosperous illiterate men undervalue education and most town councillors\r\nare moderately illiterate men, he would do his best to keep the salary\r\nand appointment of the librarian out of such hands. He would stipulate\r\nfor a salary of at least \u00a3400, in addition to housing, light and heat,\r\nand he would probably find it advisable to appoint a little committee of\r\nvisitors who would have the power to examine qualifications, endorse the\r\nappointment, and recommend the dismissal of all his four hundred\r\nlibrarians. He would probably try to make the assistantship at \u00a3100 a\r\nyear or thereabout a sort of local scholarship to be won by competition,\r\nand only the cleaner and caretaker's place would be left to the local\r\npolitician. And, of course, our philosopher would stipulate that, apart\r\nfrom all other expenditure, a sum of at least \u00a3200 a year should be set\r\naside for buying new books.\r\n\r\nSo our rich philosopher would secure at the minimum cost a number of\r\nefficiently equipped libraries throughout the country. Eight thousand\r\npounds down and \u00a3900 a year is about as cheap as a public library can\r\nbe. Below that level, it would be cheaper to have no public library.\r\nAbove that level, a public library that is not efficient is either\r\ndishonestly or incapably organised or managed, or it is serving too\r\nlarge a district and needs duplication, or it is trying to do too much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT CHESTERTON AND BELLOC\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been one of the less possible dreams of my life to be a painted\r\nPagan God and live upon a ceiling. I crown myself becomingly in stars or\r\ntendrils or with electric coruscations (as the mood takes me), and wear\r\nan easy costume free from complications and appropriate to the climate\r\nof those agreeable spaces. The company about me on the clouds varies\r\ngreatly with the mood of the vision, but always it is in some way, if\r\nnot always a very obvious way, beautiful. One frequent presence is G.K.\r\nChesterton, a joyous whirl of brush work, appropriately garmented and\r\ncrowned. When he is there, I remark, the whole ceiling is by a sort of\r\nradiation convivial. We drink limitless old October from handsome\r\nflagons, and we argue mightily about Pride (his weak point) and the\r\nnature of Deity. A hygienic, attentive, and essentially anaesthetic\r\nEagle checks, in the absence of exercise, any undue enlargement of our\r\nPromethean livers.... Chesterton often--but never by any chance Belloc.\r\nBelloc I admire beyond measure, but there is a sort of partisan\r\nviciousness about Belloc that bars him from my celestial dreams. He\r\nnever figures, no, not even in the remotest corner, on my ceiling. And\r\nyet the divine artist, by some strange skill that my ignorance of his\r\ntechnique saves me from the presumption of explaining, does indicate\r\nexactly where Belloc is. A little quiver of the paint, a faint aura,\r\nabout the spectacular masses of Chesterton? I am not certain. But no\r\nintelligent beholder can look up and miss the remarkable fact that\r\nBelloc exists--and that he is away, safely away, away in his heaven,\r\nwhich is, of course, the Park Lane Imperialist's hell. There he\r\npresides....\r\n\r\nBut in this life I do not meet Chesterton exalted upon clouds, and there\r\nis but the mockery of that endless leisure for abstract discussion\r\nafforded by my painted entertainments. I live in an urgent and incessant\r\nworld, which is at its best a wildly beautiful confusion of impressions\r\nand at its worst a dingy uproar. It crowds upon us and jostles us, we\r\nget our little interludes for thinking and talking between much rough\r\nscuffling and laying about us with our fists. And I cannot afford to be\r\ncontinually bickering with Chesterton and Belloc about forms of\r\nexpression. There are others for whom I want to save my knuckles. One\r\nmay be wasteful in peace and leisure, but economies are the soul of\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nIn many ways we three are closely akin; we diverge not by necessity but\r\naccident, because we speak in different dialects and have divergent\r\nmetaphysics. All that I can I shall persuade to my way of thinking about\r\nthought and to the use of words in my loose, expressive manner, but\r\nBelloc and Chesterton and I are too grown and set to change our\r\nlanguages now and learn new ones; we are on different roads, and so we\r\nmust needs shout to one another across intervening abysses. These two\r\nsay Socialism is a thing they do not want for men, and I say Socialism\r\nis above all what I want for men. We shall go on saying that now to the\r\nend of our days. But what we do all three want is something very alike.\r\nOur different roads are parallel. I aim at a growing collective life, a\r\nperpetually enhanced inheritance for our race, through the fullest,\r\nfreest development of the individual life. What they aim at ultimately I\r\ndo not understand, but it is manifest that its immediate form is the\r\nfullest and freest development of the individual life. We all three hate\r\nequally and sympathetically the spectacle of human beings blown up with\r\nwindy wealth and irresponsible power as cruelly and absurdly as boys\r\nblow up frogs; we all three detest the complex causes that dwarf and\r\ncripple lives from the moment of birth and starve and debase great\r\nmasses of mankind. We want as universally as possible the jolly life,\r\nmen and women warm-blooded and well-aired, acting freely and joyously,\r\ngathering life as children gather corn-cockles in corn. We all three\r\nwant people to have property of a real and personal sort, to have the\r\nson, as Chesterton put it, bringing up the port his father laid down,\r\nand pride in the pears one has grown in one's own garden. And I agree\r\nwith Chesterton that giving--giving oneself out of love and\r\nfellowship--is the salt of life.\r\n\r\nBut there I diverge from him, less in spirit, I think, than in the\r\nmanner of his expression. There is a base because impersonal way of\r\ngiving. \"Standing drink,\" which he praises as noble, is just the thing I\r\ncannot stand, the ultimate mockery and vulgarisation of that fine act of\r\nbringing out the cherished thing saved for the heaven-sent guest. It is\r\na mere commercial transaction, essentially of the evil of our time.\r\nThink of it! Two temporarily homeless beings agree to drink together,\r\nand they turn in and face the public supply of drink (a little vitiated\r\nby private commercial necessities) in the public-house. (It is horrible\r\nthat life should be so wholesale and heartless.) And Jones, with a\r\nsudden effusion of manner, thrusts twopence or ninepence (got God knows\r\nhow) into the economic mysteries and personal delicacy of Brown. I'd as\r\nsoon a man slipped sixpence down my neck. If Jones has used love and\r\nsympathy to detect a certain real thirst and need in Brown and knowledge\r\nand power in its assuaging by some specially appropriate fluid, then we\r\nhave an altogether different matter; but the common business of\r\n\"standing treat\" and giving presents and entertainments is as proud and\r\nunspiritual as cock-crowing, as foolish and inhuman as that sorry\r\ncompendium of mercantile vices, the game of poker, and I am amazed to\r\nfind Chesterton commend it.\r\n\r\nBut that is a criticism by the way. Chesterton and Belloc agree with the\r\nSocialist that the present world does not give at all what they want.\r\nThey agree that it fails to do so through a wild derangement of our\r\nproperty relations. They are in agreement with the common contemporary\r\nman (whose creed is stated, I think, not unfairly, but with the omission\r\nof certain important articles by Chesterton), that the derangements of\r\nour property relations are to be remedied by concerted action and in\r\npart by altered laws. The land and all sorts of great common interests\r\nmust be, if not owned, then at least controlled, managed, checked,\r\nredistributed by the State. Our real difference is only about a little\r\nmore or a little less owning. I do not see how Belloc and Chesterton can\r\nstand for anything but a strong State as against those wild monsters of\r\nproperty, the strong, big private owners. The State must be complex and\r\npowerful enough to prevent them. State or plutocrat there is really no\r\nother practical alternative before the world at the present time. Either\r\nwe have to let the big financial adventurers, the aggregating capitalist\r\nand his Press, in a loose, informal combination, rule the earth, either\r\nwe have got to stand aside from preventive legislation and leave things\r\nto work out on their present lines, or we have to construct a collective\r\norganisation sufficiently strong for the protection of the liberties of\r\nthe some-day-to-be-jolly common man. So far we go in common. If Belloc\r\nand Chesterton are not Socialists, they are at any rate not\r\nanti-Socialists. If they say they want an organised Christian State\r\n(which involves practically seven-tenths of the Socialist desire), then,\r\nin the face of our big common enemies, of adventurous capital, of alien\r\nImperialism, base ambition, base intelligence, and common prejudice and\r\nignorance, I do not mean to quarrel with them politically, so long as\r\nthey force no quarrel on me. Their organised Christian State is nearer\r\nthe organised State I want than our present plutocracy. Our ideals will\r\nfight some day, and it will be, I know, a first-rate fight, but to fight\r\nnow is to let the enemy in. When we have got all we want in common, then\r\nand only then can we afford to differ. I have never believed that a\r\nSocialist Party could hope to form a Government in this country in my\r\nlifetime; I believe it less now than ever I did. I don't know if any of\r\nmy Fabian colleagues entertain so remarkable a hope. But if they do not,\r\nthen unless their political aim is pure cantankerousness, they must\r\ncontemplate a working political combination between the Socialist\r\nmembers in Parliament and just that non-capitalist section of the\r\nLiberal Party for which Chesterton and Belloc speak. Perpetual\r\nopposition is a dishonourable aim in politics; and a man who mingles in\r\npolitical development with no intention of taking on responsible tasks\r\nunless he gets all his particular formulae accepted is a pervert, a\r\nvictim of Irish bad example, and unfit far decent democratic\r\ninstitutions ...\r\n\r\nI digress again, I see, but my drift I hope is clear. Differ as we may,\r\nBelloc and Chesterton are with all Socialists in being on the same side\r\nof the great political and social cleavage that opens at the present\r\ntime. We and they are with the interests of the mass of common men as\r\nagainst that growing organisation of great owners who have common\r\ninterests directly antagonistic to those of the community and State. We\r\nSocialists are only secondarily politicians. Our primary business is not\r\nto impose upon, but to ram right into the substance of that object of\r\nChesterton's solicitude, the circle of ideas of the common man, the idea\r\nof the State as his own, as a thing he serves and is served by. We want\r\nto add to his sense of property rather than offend it. If I had my way I\r\nwould do that at the street corners and on the trams, I would take down\r\nthat alien-looking and detestable inscription \"L.C.C.,\" and put up,\r\n\"This Tram, this Street, belongs to the People of London.\" Would\r\nChesterton or Belloc quarrel with that? Suppose that Chesterton is\r\nright, and that there are incurable things in the mind of the common man\r\nflatly hostile to our ideals; so much of our ideals will fail. But we\r\nare doing our best by our lights, and all we can. What are Chesterton\r\nand Belloc doing? If our ideal is partly right and partly wrong, are\r\nthey trying to build up a better ideal? Will they state a Utopia and how\r\nthey propose it shall be managed? If they lend their weight only to such\r\nfine old propositions as that a man wants freedom, that he has a right\r\nto do as he likes with his own, and so on, they won't help the common\r\nman much. All that fine talk, without some further exposition, goes to\r\nsustain Mr. Rockefeller's simple human love of property, and the woman\r\nand child sweating manufacturer in his fight for the inspector-free\r\nhome industry. I bought on a bookstall the other day a pamphlet full of\r\nmisrepresentation and bad argument against Socialism by an Australian\r\nJew, published by the Single-Tax people apparently in a disinterested\r\nattempt to free the land from the landowner by the simple expedient of\r\nabusing anyone else who wanted to do as much but did not hold Henry\r\nGeorge to be God and Lord; and I know Socialists who will protest with\r\ntears in their eyes against association with any human being who sings\r\nany song but the \"Red Flag\" and doubts whether Marx had much experience\r\nof affairs. Well, there is no reason why Chesterton and Belloc should at\r\ntheir level do the same sort of thing. When we talk on a ceiling or at a\r\ndinner-party with any touch of the celestial in its composition,\r\nChesterton and I, Belloc and I, are antagonists with an undying feud,\r\nbut in the fight against human selfishness and narrowness and for a\r\nfiner, juster law, we are brothers--at the remotest, half-brothers.\r\n\r\nChesterton isn't a Socialist--agreed! But now, as between us and the\r\nMaster of Elibank or Sir Hugh Bell or any other Free Trade Liberal\r\ncapitalist or landlord, which side is he on? You cannot have more than\r\none fight going on in the political arena at the same time, because only\r\none party or group of parties can win.\r\n\r\nAnd going back for a moment to that point about a Utopia, I want one\r\nfrom Chesterton. Purely unhelpful criticism isn't enough from a man of\r\nhis size. It isn't justifiable for him to go about sitting on other\r\npeople's Utopias. I appeal to his sense of fair play. I have done my\r\nbest to reconcile the conception of a free and generous style of\r\npersonal living with a social organisation that will save the world from\r\nthe harsh predominance of dull, persistent, energetic, unscrupulous\r\ngrabbers tempered only by the vulgar extravagance of their wives and\r\nsons. It isn't an adequate reply to say that nobody stood treat there,\r\nand that the simple, generous people like to beat their own wives and\r\nchildren on occasion in a loving and intimate manner, and that they\r\nwon't endure the spirit of Mr. Sidney Webb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT SIR THOMAS MORE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some writers who are chiefly interesting in themselves, and\r\nsome whom chance and the agreement of men have picked out as symbols and\r\nconvenient indications of some particular group or temperament of\r\nopinions. To the latter it is that Sir Thomas More belongs. An age and a\r\ntype of mind have found in him and his Utopia a figurehead and a token;\r\nand pleasant and honourable as his personality and household present\r\nthemselves to the modern reader, it is doubtful if they would by this\r\ntime have retained any peculiar distinction among the many other\r\ncontemporaries of whom we have chance glimpses in letters and suchlike\r\ndocuments, were it not that he happened to be the first man of affairs\r\nin England to imitate the \"Republic\" of Plato. By that chance it fell to\r\nhim to give the world a noun and an adjective of abuse, \"Utopian,\" and\r\nto record how under the stimulus of Plato's releasing influence the\r\nopening problems of our modern world presented themselves to the English\r\nmind of his time. For the most part the problems that exercised him are\r\nthe problems that exercise us to-day, some of them, it may be, have\r\ngrown up and intermarried, new ones have joined their company, but few,\r\nif any, have disappeared, and it is alike in his resemblances to and\r\ndifferences from the modern speculative mind that his essential interest\r\nlies.\r\n\r\nThe portrait presented by contemporary mention and his own intentional\r\nand unintentional admissions, is of an active-minded and\r\nagreeable-mannered man, a hard worker, very markedly prone to quips and\r\nwhimsical sayings and plays upon words, and aware of a double reputation\r\nas a man of erudition and a wit. This latter quality it was that won him\r\nadvancement at court, and it may have been his too clearly confessed\r\nreluctance to play the part of an informal table jester to his king that\r\nlaid the grounds of that deepening royal resentment that ended only with\r\nhis execution. But he was also valued by the king for more solid merits,\r\nhe was needed by the king, and it was more than a table scorned or a\r\nclash of opinion upon the validity of divorce; it was a more general\r\nestrangement and avoidance of service that caused that fit of regal\r\npetulance by which he died.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that he began and ended his career in the orthodox\r\nreligion and a general acquiescence in the ideas and customs of his\r\ntime, and he played an honourable and acceptable part in that time; but\r\nhis permanent interest lies not in his general conformity but in his\r\nincidental scepticism, in the fact that underlying the observances and\r\nrecognised rules and limitations that give the texture of his life were\r\nthe profoundest doubts, and that, stirred and disturbed by Plato, he saw\r\nfit to write them down. One may question if such scepticism is in itself\r\nunusual, whether any large proportion of great statesmen, great\r\necclesiastics and administrators have escaped phases of destructive\r\nself-criticism of destructive criticism of the principles upon which\r\ntheir general careers were framed. But few have made so public an\r\nadmission as Sir Thomas More. A good Catholic undoubtedly he was, and\r\nyet we find him capable of conceiving a non-Christian community\r\nexcelling all Christendom in wisdom and virtue; in practice his sense\r\nof conformity and orthodoxy was manifest enough, but in his \"Utopia\" he\r\nventures to contemplate, and that not merely wistfully, but with some\r\nconfidence, the possibility of an absolute religious toleration.\r\n\r\nThe \"Utopia\" is none the less interesting because it is one of the most\r\ninconsistent of books. Never were the forms of Socialism and Communism\r\nanimated by so entirely an Individualist soul. The hands are the hands\r\nof Plato, the wide-thinking Greek, but the voice is the voice of a\r\nhumane, public-spirited, but limited and very practical English\r\ngentleman who takes the inferiority of his inferiors for granted,\r\ndislikes friars and tramps and loafers and all undisciplined and\r\nunproductive people, and is ruler in his own household. He abounds in\r\nsound practical ideas, for the migration of harvesters, for the\r\nuniversality of gardens and the artificial incubation of eggs, and he\r\nsweeps aside all Plato's suggestion of the citizen woman as though it\r\nhad never entered his mind. He had indeed the Whig temperament, and it\r\nmanifested itself down even to the practice of reading aloud in company,\r\nwhich still prevails among the more representative survivors of the Whig\r\ntradition. He argues ably against private property, but no thought of\r\nany such radicalism as the admission of those poor peons of his, with\r\nhead half-shaved and glaring uniform against escape, to participation in\r\nownership appears in his proposals. His communism is all for the\r\nconvenience of his Syphogrants and Tranibores, those gentlemen of\r\ngravity and experience, lest one should swell up above the others. So\r\ntoo is the essential Whiggery of the limitation of the Prince's\r\nrevenues. It is the very spirit of eighteenth century Constitutionalism.\r\nAnd his Whiggery bears Utilitarianism instead of the vanity of a\r\nflower. Among his cities, all of a size, so that \"he that knoweth one\r\nknoweth all,\" the Benthamite would have revised his sceptical theology\r\nand admitted the possibility of heaven.\r\n\r\nLike any Whig, More exalted reason above the imagination at every point,\r\nand so he fails to understand the magic prestige of gold, making that\r\nbeautiful metal into vessels of dishonour to urge his case against it,\r\nnor had he any perception of the charm of extravagance, for example, or\r\nthe desirability of various clothing. The Utopians went all in coarse\r\nlinen and undyed wool--why should the world be coloured?--and all the\r\neconomy of labour and shortening of the working day was to no other end\r\nthan to prolong the years of study and the joys of reading aloud, the\r\nsimple satisfactions of the good boy at his lessons, to the very end of\r\nlife. \"In the institution of that weal publique this end is only and\r\nchiefly pretended and minded, that what time may possibly be spared from\r\nthe necessary occupations and affairs of the commonwealth, all that the\r\ncitizens should withdraw from the bodily service to the free liberty of\r\nthe mind and garnishing of the same. For herein they suppose the\r\nfelicity of this life to consist.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is no paradox to say that \"Utopia,\" which has by a conspiracy\r\nof accidents become a proverb for undisciplined fancifulness in social\r\nand political matters, is in reality a very unimaginative work. In that,\r\nnext to the accident of its priority, lies the secret of its continuing\r\ninterest. In some respects it is like one of those precious and\r\ndelightful scrapbooks people disinter in old country houses; its very\r\npoverty of synthetic power leaves its ingredients, the cuttings from and\r\nimitations of Plato, the recipe for the hatching of eggs, the stern\r\nresolutions against scoundrels and rough fellows, all the sharper and\r\nbrighter. There will always be found people to read in it, over and\r\nabove the countless multitudes who will continue ignorantly to use its\r\nname for everything most alien to More's essential quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAFFIC AND REBUILDING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London traffic problem is just one of those questions that appeal\r\nvery strongly to the more prevalent and less charitable types of English\r\nmind. It has a practical and constructive air, it deals with\r\nimpressively enormous amounts of tangible property, it rests with a\r\ncomforting effect of solidity upon assumptions that are at once doubtful\r\nand desirable. It seems free from metaphysical considerations, and it\r\nhas none of those disconcerting personal applications, those\r\npenetrations towards intimate qualities, that makes eugenics, for\r\nexample, faintly but persistently uncomfortable. It is indeed an ideal\r\nproblem for a healthy, hopeful, and progressive middle-aged public man.\r\nAnd, as I say, it deals with enormous amounts of tangible property.\r\n\r\nLike all really serious and respectable British problems it has to be\r\nhandled gently to prevent its coming to pieces in the gift. It is safest\r\nin charge of the expert, that wonderful last gift of time. He will talk\r\nrapidly about congestion, long-felt wants, low efficiency, economy, and\r\nget you into his building and rebuilding schemes with the minimum of\r\ndoubt and head-swimming. He is like a good Hendon pilot. Unspecialised\r\nwriters have the destructive analytical touch. They pull the wrong\r\nlevers. So far as one can gather from the specialists on the question,\r\nthere is very considerable congestion in many of the London\r\nthoroughfares, delays that seem to be avoidable occur in the delivery of\r\ngoods, multitudes of empty vans cumber the streets, we have hundreds of\r\nacres of idle trucks--there are more acres of railway sidings than of\r\npublic parks in Greater London--and our Overseas cousins find it\r\nticklish work crossing Regent Street and Piccadilly. Regarding life\r\nsimply as an affair of getting people and things from where they are to\r\nwhere they appear to be wanted, this seems all very muddled and wanton.\r\nSo far it is quite easy to agree with the expert. And some of the\r\nvarious and entirely incompatible schemes experts are giving us by way\r\nof a remedy, appeal very strongly to the imagination. For example, there\r\nis the railway clearing house, which, it is suggested, should cover I do\r\nnot know how many acres of what is now slumland in Shoreditch. The\r\nposition is particularly convenient for an underground connection with\r\nevery main line into London. Upon the underground level of this great\r\nbuilding every goods train into London will run. Its trucks and vans\r\nwill be unloaded, the goods passed into lifts, which will take every\r\nparcel, large and small, at once to a huge, ingeniously contrived\r\nsorting-floor above. There in a manner at once simple, ingenious and\r\neffective, they will be sorted and returned, either into delivery vans\r\nat the street level or to the trains emptied and now reloading on the\r\ntrain level. Above and below these three floors will be extensive\r\nwarehouse accommodation. Such a scheme would not only release almost all\r\nthe vast area of London now under railway yards for parks and housing,\r\nbut it would give nearly every delivery van an effective load, and\r\nprobably reduce the number of standing and empty vans or half-empty vans\r\non the streets of London to a quarter or an eighth of the present\r\nnumber. Mostly these are heavy horse vans, and their disappearance would\r\ngreatly facilitate the conversion of the road surfaces to the hard and\r\neven texture needed for horseless traffic.\r\n\r\nBut that is a scheme too comprehensive and rational for the ordinary\r\nstudent of the London traffic problem, whose mind runs for the most part\r\non costly and devastating rearrangements of the existing roadways.\r\nMoreover, it would probably secure a maximum of effect with a minimum of\r\nproperty manipulation; always an undesirable consideration in practical\r\npolitics. And it would commit London and England to goods transit by\r\nrailway for another century. Far more attractive to the expert advisers\r\nof our various municipal authorities are such projects as a new Thames\r\nbridge scheme, which will (with incalculable results) inject a new\r\nstream of traffic into Saint Paul's Churchyard; and the removal of\r\nCharing Cross Station to the south side of the river. Then, again, we\r\nhave the systematic widening of various thoroughfares, the shunting of\r\ntramways into traffic streams, and many amusing, expensive, and\r\ninteresting tunnellings and clearances. Taken together, these huge\r\nreconstructions of London are incoherent and conflicting; each is based\r\non its own assumptions and separate \"expert\" advice, and the resulting\r\nnew opening plays its part in the general circulation as duct or\r\naspirator, often with the most surprising results. The discussion of the\r\nLondon traffic problem as we practise it in our clubs is essentially the\r\nsage turning over and over again of such fragmentary schemes,\r\nheadshakings over the vacant sites about Aldwych and the Strand,\r\nbrilliant petty suggestions and--dispersal. Meanwhile the experts\r\nintrigue; one partial plan after another gets itself accepted, this and\r\nthat ancient landmark perish, builders grow rich, and architects\r\ninfamous, and some Tower Bridge horror, some vulgarity of the\r\nAutomobile Club type, some Buckingham Palace atrocity, some Regent\r\nStreet stupidity, some such cramped and thwarted thing as that new arch\r\nwhich gives upon Charing Cross is added to the confusion. I do not see\r\nany reason to suppose that this continuous muddle of partial destruction\r\nand partial rebuilding is not to constitute the future history of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nLet us, however, drop the expert methods and handle this question rather\r\nmore rudely. Do we want London rebuilt? If we do, is there, after all,\r\nany reason why we should rebuild it on its present site? London is where\r\nit is for reasons that have long ceased to be valid; it grew there, it\r\nhas accumulated associations, an immense tradition, that this constant\r\nmucking about of builders and architects is destroying almost as\r\neffectually as removal to a new site. The old sort of rebuilding was a\r\nnatural and picturesque process, house by house, and street by street, a\r\nthing as pleasing and almost as natural in effect as the spreading and\r\ninterlacing of trees; as this new building, this clearance of areas, the\r\npiercing of avenues, becomes more comprehensive, it becomes less\r\nreasonable. If we can do such big things we may surely attempt bigger\r\nthings, so that whether we want to plan a new capital or preserve the\r\nold, it comes at last to the same thing, that it is unreasonable to be\r\nconstantly pulling down the London we have and putting it up again. Let\r\nus drain away our heavy traffic into tunnels, set up that clearing-house\r\nplan, and control the growth at the periphery, which is still so witless\r\nand ugly, and, save for the manifest tidying and preserving that is\r\nneeded, begin to leave the central parts of London, which are extremely\r\ninteresting even where they are not quite beautiful, in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SO-CALLED SCIENCE OF SOCIOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has long been generally recognised that there are two quite divergent\r\nways of attacking sociological and economic questions, one that is\r\ncalled scientific and one that is not, and I claim no particular virtue\r\nin the recognition of that; but I do claim a certain freshness in my\r\nanalysis of this difference, and it is to that analysis that your\r\nattention is now called. When I claim freshness I do not make, you\r\nunderstand, any claim to original discovery. What I have to say, and\r\nhave been saying for some time, is also more or less, and with certain\r\ndifferences to be found in the thought of Professor Bosanquet, for\r\nexample, in Alfred Sidgwick's \"Use of Words in Reasoning,\" in Sigwart's\r\n\"Logic,\" in contemporary American metaphysical speculation. I am only\r\none incidental voice speaking in a general movement of thought. My trend\r\nof thought leads me to deny that sociology is a science, or only a\r\nscience in the same loose sense that modern history is a science, and to\r\nthrow doubt upon the value of sociology that follows too closely what is\r\ncalled the scientific method.\r\n\r\nThe drift of my argument is to dispute not only that sociology is a\r\nscience, but also to deny that Herbert Spencer and Comte are to be\r\nexalted as the founders of a new and fruitful system of human inquiry. I\r\nfind myself forced to depreciate these modern idols, and to reinstate\r\nthe Greek social philosophers in their vacant niches, to ask you rather\r\nto go to Plato for the proper method, the proper way of thinking\r\nsociologically.\r\n\r\nWe certainly owe the word Sociology to Comte, a man of exceptionally\r\nmethodical quality. I hold he developed the word logically from an\r\narbitrary assumption that the whole universe of being was reducible to\r\nmeasurable and commeasurable and exact and consistent expressions.\r\n\r\nIn a very obvious way, sociology seemed to Comte to crown the edifice of\r\nthe sciences; it was to be to the statesman what pathology and\r\nphysiology were to the doctor; and one gathers that, for the most part,\r\nhe regarded it as an intellectual procedure in no way differing from\r\nphysics. His classification of the sciences shows pretty clearly that he\r\nthought of them all as exact logical systematisations of fact arising\r\nout of each other in a synthetic order, each lower one containing the\r\nelements of a lucid explanation of those above it--physics explaining\r\nchemistry; chemistry, physiology; physiology, sociology; and so forth.\r\nHis actual method was altogether unscientific; but through all his work\r\nruns the assumption that in contrast with his predecessors he is really\r\nbeing as exact and universally valid as mathematics. To Herbert\r\nSpencer--very appropriately since his mental characteristics make him\r\nthe English parallel to Comte--we owe the naturalisation of the word in\r\nEnglish. His mind being of greater calibre than Comte's, the subject\r\nacquired in his hands a far more progressive character. Herbert Spencer\r\nwas less unfamiliar with natural history than with any other branch of\r\npractical scientific work; and it was natural he should turn to it for\r\nprecedents in sociological research. His mind was invaded by the idea\r\nof classification, by memories of specimens and museums; and he\r\ninitiated that accumulation of desiccated anthropological anecdotes that\r\nstill figures importantly in current sociological work. On the lines he\r\ninitiated sociological investigation, what there is of it, still tends\r\nto go.\r\n\r\nFrom these two sources mainly the work of contemporary sociologists\r\nderives. But there persists about it a curious discursiveness that\r\nreflects upon the power and value of the initial impetus. Mr. V.V.\r\nBranford, the able secretary of the Sociological Society, recently\r\nattempted a useful work in a classification of the methods of what he\r\ncalls \"approach,\" a word that seems to me eminently judicious and\r\nexpressive. A review of the first volume the Sociological Society has\r\nproduced brings home the aptness of this image of exploratory\r\noperations, of experiments in \"taking a line.\" The names of Dr. Beattie\r\nCrozier and Mr. Benjamin Kidd recall works that impress one as\r\nlarge-scale sketches of a proposed science rather than concrete\r\nbeginnings and achievements. The search for an arrangement, a \"method,\"\r\ncontinues as though they were not. The desperate resort to the\r\nanalogical method of Commenius is confessed by Dr. Steinmetz, who talks\r\nof social morphology, physiology, pathology, and so forth. There is also\r\na less initiative disposition in the Vicomte Combes de Lestrade and in\r\nthe work of Professor Giddings. In other directions sociological work is\r\napt to lose its general reference altogether, to lapse towards some\r\ndepartment of activity not primarily sociological at all. Examples of\r\nthis are the works of Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb, M. Ostrogorski and M.\r\nGustave le Bon. From a contemplation of all this diversity Professor\r\nDurkheim emerges, demanding a \"synthetic science,\" \"certain synthetic\r\nconceptions\"--and Professor Karl Pearson endorses the demand--to fuse\r\nall these various activities into something that will live and grow.\r\nWhat is it that tangles this question so curiously that there is not\r\nonly a failure to arrive at a conclusion, but a failure to join issue?\r\n\r\nWell, there is a certain not too clearly recognised order in the\r\nsciences to which I wish to call your attention, and which forms the\r\ngist of my case against this scientific pretension. There is a gradation\r\nin the importance of the instance as one passes from mechanics and\r\nphysics and chemistry through the biological sciences to economics and\r\nsociology, a gradation whose correlatives and implications have not yet\r\nreceived adequate recognition, and which do profoundly affect the method\r\nof study and research in each science.\r\n\r\nLet me begin by pointing out that, in the more modern conceptions of\r\nlogic, it is recognised that there are no identically similar objective\r\nexperiences; the disposition is to conceive all real objective being as\r\nindividual and unique. This is not a singular eccentric idea of mine; it\r\nis one for which ample support is to be found in the writings of\r\nabsolutely respectable contemporaries, who are quite untainted by\r\nassociation with fiction. It is now understood that conceivably only in\r\nthe subjective world, and in theory and the imagination, do we deal with\r\nidentically similar units, and with absolutely commensurable quantities.\r\nIn the real world it is reasonable to suppose we deal at most with\r\n_practically_ similar units and _practically_ commensurable quantities.\r\nBut there is a strong bias, a sort of labour-saving bias in the normal\r\nhuman mind to ignore this, and not only to speak but to think of a\r\nthousand bricks or a thousand sheep or a thousand sociologists as though\r\nthey were all absolutely true to sample. If it is brought before a\r\nthinker for a moment that in any special case this is not so, he slips\r\nback to the old attitude as soon as his attention is withdrawn. This\r\nsource of error has, for instance, caught nearly the whole race of\r\nchemists, with one or two distinguished exceptions, and _atoms_ and\r\n_ions_ and so forth of the same species are tacitly assumed to be\r\nsimilar one to another. Be it noted that, so far as the practical\r\nresults of chemistry and physics go, it scarcely matters which\r\nassumption we adopt. For purposes of inquiry and discussion the\r\nincorrect one is infinitely more convenient.\r\n\r\nBut this ceases to be true directly we emerge from the region of\r\nchemistry and physics. In the biological sciences of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, commonsense struggled hard to ignore individuality in shells\r\nand plants and animals. There was an attempt to eliminate the more\r\nconspicuous departures as abnormalities, as sports, nature's weak\r\nmoments, and it was only with the establishment of Darwin's great\r\ngeneralisation that the hard and fast classificatory system broke down,\r\nand individuality came to its own. Yet there had always been a clearly\r\nfelt difference between the conclusions of the biological sciences and\r\nthose dealing with lifeless substance, in the relative vagueness, the\r\ninsubordinate looseness and inaccuracy of the former. The naturalist\r\naccumulated facts and multiplied names, but he did not go triumphantly\r\nfrom generalisation to generalisation after the fashion of the chemist\r\nor physicist. It is easy to see, therefore, how it came about that the\r\ninorganic sciences were regarded as the true scientific bed-rock. It\r\nwas scarcely suspected that the biological sciences might perhaps, after\r\nall, be _truer_ than the experimental, in spite of the difference in\r\npractical value in favour of the latter. It was, and is by the great\r\nmajority of people to this day, supposed to be the latter that are\r\ninvincibly true; and the former are regarded as a more complex set of\r\nproblems merely, with obliquities and refractions that presently will be\r\nexplained away. Comte and Herbert Spencer certainly seem to me to have\r\ntaken that much for granted. Herbert Spencer no doubt talked of the\r\nunknown and the unknowable, but not in this sense, as an element of\r\ninexactness running through all things. He thought of the unknown as the\r\nindefinable beyond to an immediate world that might be quite clearly and\r\nexactly known.\r\n\r\nWell, there is a growing body of people who are beginning to hold the\r\nconverse view--that counting, classification, measurement, the whole\r\nfabric of mathematics, is subjective and deceitful, and that the\r\nuniqueness of individuals is the objective truth. As the number of units\r\ntaken diminishes, the amount of variety and inexactness of\r\ngeneralisation increases, because individuality tells more and more.\r\nCould you take men by the thousand billion, you could generalise about\r\nthem as you do about atoms; could you take atoms singly, it may be you\r\nwould find them as individual as your aunts and cousins. That concisely\r\nis the minority belief, and it is the belief on which this present paper\r\nis based.\r\n\r\nNow, what is called the scientific method is the method of ignoring\r\nindividualities; and, like many mathematical conventions, its great\r\npractical convenience is no proof whatever of its final truth. Let me\r\nadmit the enormous value, the wonder of its results in mechanics, in all\r\nthe physical sciences, in chemistry, even in physiology--but what is its\r\nvalue beyond that? Is the scientific method of value in biology? The\r\ngreat advances made by Darwin and his school in biology were not made,\r\nit must be remembered, by the scientific method, as it is generally\r\nconceived, at all. He conducted a research into pre-documentary history.\r\nHe collected information along the lines indicated by certain\r\ninterrogations; and the bulk of his work was the digesting and critical\r\nanalysis of that. For documents and monuments he had fossils and\r\nanatomical structures and germinating eggs too innocent to lie, and so\r\nfar he was nearer simplicity. But, on the other hand, he had to\r\ncorrespond with breeders and travellers of various sorts, classes\r\nentirely analogous, from the point of view of evidence, to the writers\r\nof history and memoirs. I question profoundly whether the word\r\n\"science,\" in current usage anyhow, ever means such patient\r\ndisentanglement as Darwin pursued. It means the attainment of something\r\npositive and emphatic in the way of a conclusion, based on amply\r\nrepeated experiments capable of infinite repetition, \"proved,\" as they\r\nsay, \"up to the hilt.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be, of course, possible to dispute whether the word \"science\"\r\nshould convey this quality of certitude; but to most people it certainly\r\ndoes at the present time. So far as the movements of comets and electric\r\ntrams go, there is, no doubt, practically cocksure science; and\r\nindisputably Comte and Herbert Spencer believed that cocksure could be\r\nextended to every conceivable finite thing. The fact that Herbert\r\nSpencer called a certain doctrine Individualism reflects nothing on the\r\nnon-individualising quality of his primary assumptions and of his mental\r\ntexture. He believed that individuality (heterogeneity) was and is an\r\nevolutionary product from an original homogeneity. It seems to me that\r\nthe general usage is entirely for the limitation of the use of the word\r\n\"science\" to knowledge and the search after knowledge of a high degree\r\nof precision. And not simply the general usage: \"Science is\r\nmeasurement,\" Science is \"organised common sense,\" proud, in fact, of\r\nits essential error, scornful of any metaphysical analysis of its terms.\r\n\r\nIf we quite boldly face the fact that hard positive methods are less and\r\nless successful just in proportion as our \"ologies\" deal with larger and\r\nless numerous individuals; if we admit that we become less \"scientific\"\r\nas we ascend the scale of the sciences, and that we do and must change\r\nour method, then, it is humbly submitted we shall be in a much better\r\nposition to consider the question of \"approaching\" sociology. We shall\r\nrealise that all this talk of the organisation of sociology, as though\r\npresently the sociologist would be going about the world with the\r\nauthority of a sanitary engineer, is and will remain nonsense.\r\n\r\nIn one respect we shall still be in accordance with the Positivist map\r\nof the field of human knowledge; with us as with that, sociology stands\r\nat the extreme end of the scale from the molecular sciences. In these\r\nlatter there is an infinitude of units; in sociology, as Comte\r\nperceived, there is only one unit. It is true that Herbert Spencer, in\r\norder to get classification somehow, did, as Professor Durkheim has\r\npointed out, separate human society into societies, and made believe\r\nthey competed one with another and died and reproduced just like\r\nanimals, and that economists, following List, have for the purposes of\r\nfiscal controversy discovered economic types; but this is a transparent\r\ndevice, and one is surprised to find thoughtful and reputable writers\r\noff their guard against such bad analogy. But, indeed, it is impossible\r\nto isolate complete communities of men, or to trace any but rude general\r\nresemblances between group and group. These alleged units have as much\r\nindividuality as pieces of cloud; they come, they go, they fuse and\r\nseparate. And we are forced to conclude that not only is the method of\r\nobservation, experiment, and verification left far away down the scale,\r\nbut that the method of classification under types, which has served so\r\nuseful a purpose in the middle group of subjects, the subjects involving\r\nnumerous but a finite number of units, has also to be abandoned here. We\r\ncannot put Humanity into a museum, or dry it for examination; our one\r\nsingle still living specimen is all history, all anthropology, and the\r\nfluctuating world of men. There is no satisfactory means of dividing it,\r\nand nothing else in the real world with which to compare it. We have\r\nonly the remotest ideas of its \"life-cycle\" and a few relics of its\r\norigin and dreams of its destiny ...\r\n\r\nSociology, it is evident, is, upon any hypothesis, no less than the\r\nattempt to bring that vast, complex, unique Being, its subject, into\r\nclear, true relations with the individual intelligence. Now, since\r\nindividual intelligences are individual, and each is a little\r\ndifferently placed in regard to the subject under consideration, since\r\nthe personal angle of vision is much wider towards humanity than towards\r\nthe circumambient horizon of matter, it should be manifest that no\r\nsociology of universal compulsion, of anything approaching the general\r\nvalidity of the physical sciences, is ever to be hoped for--at least\r\nupon the metaphysical assumptions of this paper. With that conceded, we\r\nmay go on to consider the more hopeful ways in which that great Being\r\nmay be presented in a comprehensible manner. Essentially this\r\npresentation must involve an element of self-expression must partake\r\nquite as much of the nature of art as of science. One finds in the first\r\nconference of the Sociological Society, Professor Stein, speaking,\r\nindeed a very different philosophical dialect from mine, but coming to\r\nthe same practical conclusion in the matter, and Mr. Osman Newland\r\ncounting \"evolving ideals for the future\" as part of the sociologist's\r\nwork. Mr. Alfred Fouill\u00e9e also moves very interestingly in the region of\r\nthis same idea; he concedes an essential difference between sociology\r\nand all other sciences in the fact of a \"certain kind of liberty\r\nbelonging to society in the exercise of its higher functions.\" He says\r\nfurther: \"If this view be correct, it will not do for us to follow in\r\nthe steps of Comte and Spencer, and transfer, bodily and ready-made, the\r\nconceptions and the methods of the natural sciences into the science of\r\nsociety. For here the fact of _consciousness_ entails a reaction of the\r\nwhole assemblage of social phenomena upon themselves, such as the\r\nnatural sciences have no example of.\" And he concludes: \"Sociology\r\nought, therefore, to guard carefully against the tendency to crystallise\r\nthat which is essentially fluid and moving, the tendency to consider as\r\ngiven fact or dead data that which creates itself and gives itself into\r\nthe world of phenomena continually by force of its own ideal\r\nconception.\" These opinions do, in their various keys, sound a similar\r\n_motif_ to mine. If, indeed, the tendency of these remarks is\r\njustifiable, then unavoidably the subjective element, which is beauty,\r\nmust coalesce with the objective, which is truth; and sociology mast be\r\nneither art simply, nor science in the narrow meaning of the word at\r\nall, but knowledge rendered imaginatively, and with an element of\r\npersonality that is to say, in the highest sense of the term,\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nIf this contention is sound, if therefore we boldly set aside Comte and\r\nSpencer altogether, as pseudo-scientific interlopers rather than the\r\nauthoritative parents of sociology, we shall have to substitute for the\r\nclassifications of the social sciences an inquiry into the chief\r\nliterary forms that subserve sociological purposes. Of these there are\r\ntwo, one invariably recognised as valuable and one which, I think, under\r\nthe matter-of-fact scientific obsession, is altogether underrated and\r\nneglected The first, which is the social side of history, makes up the\r\nbulk of valid sociological work at the present time. Of history there is\r\nthe purely descriptive part, the detailed account of past or\r\ncontemporary social conditions, or of the sequence of such conditions;\r\nand, in addition, there is the sort of historical literature that seeks\r\nto elucidate and impose general interpretations upon the complex of\r\noccurrences and institutions, to establish broad historical\r\ngeneralisations, to eliminate the mass of irrelevant incident, to\r\npresent some great period of history, or all history, in the light of\r\none dramatic sequence, or as one process. This Dr. Beattie Crozier, for\r\nexample, attempts in his \"History of Intellectual Development.\" Equally\r\ncomprehensive is Buckle's \"History of Civilisation.\" Lecky's \"History of\r\nEuropean Morals,\" during the onset of Christianity again, is essentially\r\nsociology. Numerous works--Atkinson's \"Primal Law,\" and Andrew Lang's\r\n\"Social Origins,\" for example--may be considered, as it were, to be\r\nfragments to the same purport. In the great design of Gibbon's \"Decline\r\nand Fall of the Roman Empire,\" or Carlyle's \"French Revolution,\" you\r\nhave a greater insistence upon the dramatic and picturesque elements in\r\nhistory, but in other respects an altogether kindred endeavour to impose\r\nupon the vast confusions of the past a scheme of interpretation,\r\nvaluable just to the extent of its literary value, of the success with\r\nwhich the discrepant masses have been fused and cast into the shape the\r\ninsight of the writer has determined. The writing of great history is\r\nentirely analogous to fine portraiture, in which fact is indeed\r\nmaterial, but material entirely subordinate to vision.\r\n\r\nOne main branch of the work of a Sociological Society therefore should\r\nsurely be to accept and render acceptable, to provide understanding,\r\ncriticism, and stimulus for such literary activities as restore the dead\r\nbones of the past to a living participation in our lives.\r\n\r\nBut it is in the second and at present neglected direction that I\r\nbelieve the predominant attack upon the problem implied by the word\r\n\"sociology\" must lie; the attack that must be finally driven home. There\r\nis no such thing in sociology as dispassionately considering what _is_,\r\nwithout considering what is _intended to be_. In sociology, beyond any\r\npossibility of evasion, ideas are facts. The history of civilisation is\r\nreally the history of the appearance and reappearance, the tentatives\r\nand hesitations and alterations, the manifestations and reflections in\r\nthis mind and that, of a very complex, imperfect elusive idea, the\r\nSocial Idea. It is that idea struggling to exist and realise itself in\r\na world of egotisms, animalisms, and brute matter. Now, I submit it is\r\nnot only a legitimate form of approach, but altogether the most\r\npromising and hopeful form of approach, to endeavour to disentangle and\r\nexpress one's personal version of that idea, and to measure realities\r\nfrom the stand-point of that idealisation. I think, in fact, that the\r\ncreation of Utopias--and their exhaustive criticism--is the proper and\r\ndistinctive method of sociology.\r\n\r\nSuppose now the Sociological Society, or some considerable proportion of\r\nit, were to adopt this view, that sociology is the description of the\r\nIdeal Society and its relation to existing societies, would not this\r\ngive the synthetic framework Professor Durkheim, for example, has said\r\nto be needed?\r\n\r\nAlmost all the sociological literature beyond the province of history\r\nthat has stood the test of time and established itself in the esteem of\r\nmen is frankly Utopian. Plato, when his mind turned to schemes of social\r\nreconstruction thrust his habitual form of dialogue into a corner; both\r\nthe \"Republic\" and the \"Laws\" are practically Utopias in monologue; and\r\nAristotle found the criticism of the Utopian suggestions of his\r\npredecessors richly profitable. Directly the mind of the world emerged\r\nagain at the Renascence from intellectual barbarism in the brief\r\nbreathing time before Sturm and the schoolmasters caught it and birched\r\nit into scholarship and a new period of sterility, it went on from Plato\r\nto the making of fresh Utopias. Not without profit did More discuss\r\npauperism in this form and Bacon the organisation of research; and the\r\nyeast of the French Revolution was Utopias. Even Comte, all the while\r\nthat he is professing science, fact, precision, is adding detail after\r\ndetail to the intensely personal Utopia of a Western Republic that\r\nconstitutes his one meritorious gift to the world. Sociologists cannot\r\nhelp making Utopias; though they avoid the word, though they deny the\r\nidea with passion, their very silences shape a Utopia. Why should they\r\nnot follow the precedent of Aristotle, and accept Utopias as material?\r\n\r\nThere used to be in my student days, and probably still flourishes, a\r\nmost valuable summary of fact and theory in comparative anatomy, called\r\nRolleston's \"Forms of Animal Life.\" I figure to myself a similar book, a\r\nsort of dream book of huge dimensions, in reality perhaps dispersed in\r\nmany volumes by many hands, upon the Ideal Society. This book, this\r\npicture of the perfect state, would be the backbone of sociology. It\r\nwould have great sections devoted to such questions as the extent of the\r\nIdeal Society, its relation to racial differences, the relations of the\r\nsexes in it, its economic organisations, its organisation for thought\r\nand education, its \"Bible\"--as Dr. Beattie Crozier would say--its\r\nhousing and social atmosphere, and so forth. Almost all the divaricating\r\nwork at present roughly classed together as sociological could be\r\nbrought into relation in the simplest manner, either as new suggestions,\r\nas new discussion or criticism, as newly ascertained facts bearing upon\r\nsuch discussions and sustaining or eliminating suggestions. The\r\ninstitutions of existing states would come into comparison with the\r\ninstitutions of the Ideal State, their failures and defects would be\r\ncriticised most effectually in that relation, and the whole science of\r\ncollective psychology, the psychology of human association, would be\r\nbrought to bear upon the question of the practicability of this proposed\r\nideal.\r\n\r\nThis method would give not only a boundary shape to all sociological\r\nactivities, but a scheme of arrangement for text books and lectures, and\r\npoints of direction and reference for the graduation and post graduate\r\nwork of sociological students.\r\n\r\nOnly one group of inquiries commonly classed as sociological would have\r\nto be left out of direct relationship with this Ideal State; and that is\r\ninquiries concerning the rough expedients to meet the failure of\r\nimperfect institutions. Social emergency work of all sorts comes under\r\nthis head. What to do with the pariah dogs of Constantinople, what to do\r\nwith the tramps who sleep in the London parks, how to organise a soup\r\nkitchen or a Bible coffee van, how to prevent ignorant people, who have\r\nnothing else to do, getting drunk in beer-houses, are no doubt serious\r\nquestions for the practical administrator, questions of primary\r\nimportance to the politician; but they have no more to do with sociology\r\nthan the erection of a temporary hospital after the collision of two\r\ntrains has to do with railway engineering.\r\n\r\nSo much for my second and most central and essential portion of\r\nsociological work. It should be evident that the former part, the\r\nhistorical part, which conceivably will be much the bulkier and more\r\nabundant of the two, will in effect amount to a history of the\r\nsuggestions in circumstance and experience of that Idea of Society of\r\nwhich the second will consist, and of the instructive failures in\r\nattempting its incomplete realisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVORCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time is fast approaching when it will be necessary for the general\r\ncitizen to form definite opinions upon proposals for probably quite\r\nextensive alterations of our present divorce laws, arising out of the\r\nrecommendations of the recent Royal Commission on the subject. It may\r\nnot be out of place, therefore, to run through some of the chief points\r\nthat are likely to be raised, and to set out the main considerations\r\naffecting these issues.\r\n\r\nDivorce is not one of those things that stand alone, and neither divorce\r\nlaw nor the general principles of divorce are to be discussed without a\r\nreference to antecedent arrangements. Divorce is a sequel to marriage,\r\nand a change in the divorce law is essentially a change in the marriage\r\nlaw. There was a time in this country when our marriage was a\r\npractically divorceless bond, soluble only under extraordinary\r\ncircumstances by people in situations of exceptional advantage for doing\r\nso. Now it is a bond under conditions, and in the event of the adultery\r\nof the wife, or of the adultery plus cruelty or plus desertion of the\r\nhusband, and of one or two other rarer and more dreadful offences, it\r\ncan be broken at the instance of the aggrieved party. A change in the\r\ndivorce law is a change in the dissolution clauses, so to speak, of the\r\ncontract for the marriage partnership. It is a change in the marriage\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nA great number of people object to divorce under any circumstances\r\nwhatever. This is the case with the orthodox Catholic and with the\r\northodox Positivist. And many religious and orthodox people carry their\r\nassertion of the indissolubility of marriage to the grave; they demand\r\nthat the widow or widower shall remain unmarried, faithful to the vows\r\nmade at the altar until death comes to the release of the lonely\r\nsurvivor also. Re-marriage is regarded by such people as a posthumous\r\nbigamy. There is certainly a very strong and logical case to be made out\r\nfor a marriage bond that is indissoluble even by death. It banishes\r\nstep-parents from the world. It confers a dignity of tragic\r\ninevitability upon the association of husband and wife, and makes a love\r\napproach the gravest, most momentous thing in life. It banishes for ever\r\nany dream of escape from the presence and service of either party, or of\r\nany separation from the children of the union. It affords no alternative\r\nto \"making the best of it\" for either husband or wife; they have taken a\r\nstep as irrevocable as suicide. And some logical minds would even go\r\nfurther, and have no law as between the members of a family, no rights,\r\nno private property within that limit. The family would be the social\r\nunit and the father its public representative, and though the law might\r\nintervene if he murdered or ill-used wife or children, or they him, it\r\nwould do so in just the same spirit that it might prevent him from\r\nself-mutilation or attempted suicide, for the good of the State simply,\r\nand not to defend any supposed independence of the injured member. There\r\nis much, I assert, to be said for such a complete shutting up of the\r\nfamily from the interference of the law, and not the least among these\r\nreasons is the entire harmony of such a view with the passionate\r\ninstincts of the natural man and woman in these matters. All\r\nunsophisticated human beings appear disposed to a fierce proprietorship\r\nin their children and their sexual partners, and in no respect is the\r\nordinary mortal so easily induced to vehemence and violence.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I do not think the maintenance of a marriage that is\r\nindissoluble, that precludes the survivor from re-marriage, that gives\r\nneither party an external refuge from the misbehaviour of the other, and\r\nmakes the children the absolute property of their parents until they\r\ngrow up, would cause any very general unhappiness Most people are\r\nreasonable enough, good-tempered enough, and adaptable enough to shake\r\ndown even in a grip so rigid, and I would even go further and say that\r\nits very rigidity, the entire absence of any way out at all, would\r\noblige innumerable people to accommodate themselves to its conditions\r\nand make a working success of unions that, under laxer conditions, would\r\nbe almost certainly dissolved. We should have more people of what I may\r\ncall the \"broken-in\" type than an easier release would create, but to\r\nmany thinkers the spectacle of a human being thoroughly \"broken-in\" is\r\nin itself extremely satisfactory. A few more crimes of desperation\r\nperhaps might occur, to balance against an almost universal effort to\r\nachieve contentment and reconciliation. We should hear more of the\r\n\"natural law\" permitting murder by the jealous husband or by the jealous\r\nwife, and the traffic in poisons would need a sedulous attention--but\r\neven there the impossibility of re-marriage would operate to restrain\r\nthe impatient. On the whole, I can imagine the world rubbing along very\r\nwell with marriage as unaccommodating as a perfected steel trap.\r\nExceptional people might suffer or sin wildly--to the general amusement\r\nor indignation.\r\n\r\nBut when once we part from the idea of such a rigid and eternal\r\nmarriage bond--and the law of every civilised country and the general\r\nthought and sentiment everywhere have long since done so--then the whole\r\nquestion changes. If marriage is not so absolutely sacred a bond, if it\r\nis not an eternal bond, but a bond we may break on this account or that,\r\nthen at once we put the question on a different footing. If we may\r\nterminate it for adultery or cruelty, or any cause whatever, if we may\r\nsuspend the intimacy of husband and wife by separation orders and the\r\nlike, if we recognise their separate property and interfere between them\r\nand their children to ensure the health and education of the latter,\r\nthen we open at once the whole question of a terminating agreement.\r\nMarriage ceases to be an unlimited union and becomes a definite\r\ncontract. We raise the whole question of \"What are the limits in\r\nmarriage, and how and when may a marriage terminate?\"\r\n\r\nNow, many answers are being given to that question at the present time.\r\nWe may take as the extremest opposite to the eternal marriage idea the\r\nproposal of Mr. Bernard Shaw, that marriage should be terminable at the\r\ninstance of either party. You would give due and public notice that your\r\nmarriage was at an end, and it would be at an end. This is marriage at\r\nits minimum, as the eternal indissoluble marriage is marriage at its\r\nmaximum, and the only conceivable next step would be to have a marriage\r\nmakeable by the oral declaration of both parties and terminable by the\r\noral declaration of either, which would be, indeed, no marriage at all,\r\nbut an encounter. You might marry a dozen times in that way in a day....\r\nSomewhere between these extremes lies the marriage law of a civilised\r\nstate. Let us, rather than working down from the eternal marriage of\r\nthe religious idealists, work up from Mr. Shaw. The former course is,\r\nperhaps, inevitable for the legislator, but the latter is much more\r\nconvenient for our discussion.\r\n\r\nNow, the idea of a divorce so easy and wilful as Mr. Shaw proposes\r\narises naturally out of an exclusive consideration of what I may call\r\nthe amorous sentimentalities of marriage. If you regard marriage as\r\nmerely the union of two people in love, then, clearly, it is\r\nintolerable, an outrage upon human dignity, that they should remain\r\nintimately united when either ceases to love. And in that world of Mr.\r\nShaw's dreams, in which everybody is to have an equal income and nobody\r\nis to have children, in that culminating conversazione of humanity, his\r\nmarriage law will, no doubt, work with the most admirable results. But\r\nif we make a step towards reality and consider a world in which incomes\r\nare unequal, and economic difficulties abound--for the present we will\r\nignore the complication of offspring--we at once find it necessary to\r\nmodify the first fine simplicity of divorce at either partner's request.\r\nMarriage is almost always a serious economic disturbance for both man\r\nand woman: work has to be given up and rearranged, resources have to be\r\npooled; only in the rarest cases does it escape becoming an indefinite\r\nbusiness partnership. Accordingly, the withdrawal of one partner raises\r\nat once all sorts of questions of financial adjustment, compensation for\r\nphysical, mental, and moral damage, division of furniture and effects\r\nand so forth. No doubt a very large part of this could be met if there\r\nexisted some sort of marriage settlement providing for the dissolution\r\nof the partnership. Otherwise the petitioner for a Shaw-esque divorce\r\nmust be prepared for the most exhaustive and penetrating examination\r\nbefore, say, a court of three assessors--representing severally the\r\nhusband, the wife, and justice--to determine the distribution of the\r\nseparation. This point, however, leads me to note in passing the need\r\nthat does exist even to-day for a more precise business supplement to\r\nmarriage as we know it in England and America. I think there ought to be\r\na very definite and elaborate treaty of partnership drawn up by an\r\nimpartial private tribunal for every couple that marries, providing for\r\nmost of the eventualities of life, taking cognizance of the earning\r\npower, the property and prospects of either party, insisting upon due\r\ninsurances, ensuring private incomes for each partner, securing the\r\nwelfare of the children, and laying down equitable conditions in the\r\nevent of a divorce or separation. Such a treaty ought to be a necessary\r\nprelude to the issue of a licence to marry. And given such a basis to go\r\nupon, then I see no reason why, in the case of couples who remain\r\nchildless for five or six years, let us say, and seem likely to remain\r\nchildless, the Shaw-esque divorce at the instance of either party,\r\nwithout reason assigned, should not be a very excellent thing indeed.\r\n\r\nAnd I take up this position because I believe in the family as the\r\njustification of marriage. Marriage to me is no mystical and eternal\r\nunion, but a practical affair, to be judged as all practical things are\r\njudged--by its returns in happiness and human welfare. And directly we\r\npass from the mists and glamours of amorous passion to the warm\r\nrealities of the nursery, we pass into a new system of considerations\r\naltogether. We are no longer considering A. in relation to Mrs. A., but\r\nA. and Mrs. A. in relation to an indefinite number of little A.'s, who\r\nare the very life of the State in which they live. Into the case of Mr.\r\nA. _v_. Mrs. A. come Master A. and Miss A. intervening. They have the\r\nstrongest claim against both their parents for love, shelter and\r\nupbringing, and the legislator and statesman, concerned as he is chiefly\r\nwith the future of the community, has the strongest reasons for seeing\r\nthat they get these things, even at the price of considerable vexation,\r\nboredom or indignity to Mr. and Mrs. A. And here it is that there arises\r\nthe rational case against free and frequent divorce and the general\r\nunsettlement and fluctuation of homes that would ensue.\r\n\r\nAt this point we come to the verge of a jungle of questions that would\r\ndemand a whole book for anything like a complete answer. Let us try as\r\nswiftly and simply as possible to form a general idea at least of the\r\nway through. Remember that we are working upward from Mr. Shaw's\r\nquestion of \"Why not separate at the choice of either party?\" We have\r\ngot thus far, that no two people who do not love each other should be\r\ncompelled to live together, except where the welfare of their children\r\ncomes in to override their desire to separate, and now we have to\r\nconsider what may or may not be for the welfare of the children. Mr.\r\nShaw, following the late Samuel Butler, meets this difficulty by the\r\nmost extravagant abuse of parents. He would have us believe that the\r\nworst enemies a child can have are its mother and father, and that the\r\nonly civilised path to citizenship is by the incubator, the cr\u00eache, and\r\nthe mixed school and college. In these matters he is not only ignorant,\r\nbut unfeeling and unsympathetic, extraordinarily so in view of his great\r\ncapacity for pity and sweetness in other directions and of his indignant\r\nhatred of cruelty and unfairness, and it is not necessary to waste time\r\nin discussing what the common experience confutes Neither is it\r\nnecessary to fly to the other extreme, and indulge in preposterous\r\nsentimentalities about the magic of fatherhood and a mother's love.\r\nThese are not magic and unlimited things, but touchingly qualified and\r\nhuman things. The temperate truth of the matter is that in most parents\r\nthere are great stores of pride, interest, natural sympathy, passionate\r\nlove and devotion which can be tapped in the interests of the children\r\nand the social future, and that it is the mere commonsense of statecraft\r\nto use their resources to the utmost. It does not follow that every\r\nparent contains these reservoirs, and that a continual close association\r\nwith the parents is always beneficial to children. If it did, we should\r\nhave to prosecute everyone who employed a governess or sent away a\r\nlittle boy to a preparatory school. And our real task is to establish a\r\ntest that will gauge the desirability and benefit of a parent's\r\ncontinued parentage. There are certainly parents and homes from which\r\nthe children might be taken with infinite benefit to themselves and to\r\nsociety, and whose union it is ridiculous to save from the divorce court\r\nshears.\r\n\r\nSuppose, now, we made the willingness of a parent to give up his or her\r\nchildren the measure of his beneficialness to them. There is no reason\r\nwhy we should restrict divorce only to the relation of husband and wife.\r\nLet us broaden the word and make it conceivable for a husband or wife to\r\ndivorce not only the partner, but the children. Then it might be\r\npossible to meet the demands of the Shaw-esque extremist up to the point\r\nof permitting a married parent, who desired freedom, to petition for a\r\ndivorce, not from his or her partner simply, but from his or her\r\nfamily, and even for a widow or widower to divorce a family. Then would\r\ncome the task of the assessors. They would make arrangements for the\r\ndissolution of the relationship, erring from justice rather in the\r\ndirection of liberality towards the divorced group, they would determine\r\ncontributions, exact securities appoint trustees and guardians.... On\r\nthe whole, I do not see why such a system should not work very well. It\r\nwould break up many loveless homes, quarrelling and bickering homes, and\r\ngive a safety-valve for that hate which is the sinister shadow of love.\r\nI do not think it would separate one child from one parent who was\r\nreally worthy of its possession.\r\n\r\nSo far I have discussed only the possibility of divorce without\r\noffences, the sort of divorce that arises out of estrangement and\r\nincompatibilities. But divorce, as it is known in most Christian\r\ncountries, has a punitive element, and is obtained through the failure\r\nof one of the parties to observe the conditions of the bond and the\r\ndetermination of the other to exact suffering. Divorce as it exists at\r\npresent is not a readjustment but a revenge. It is the nasty exposure of\r\na private wrong. In England a husband may divorce his wife for a single\r\nact of infidelity, and there can be little doubt that we are on the eve\r\nof an equalisation of the law in this respect. I will confess I consider\r\nthis an extreme concession to the passion of jealousy, and one likely to\r\ntear off the roof from many a family of innocent children. Only\r\ninfidelity leading to supposititious children in the case of the wife,\r\nor infidelity obstinately and offensively persisted in or endangering\r\nhealth in the case of the husband, really injure the home sufficiently\r\nto justify a divorce on the assumptions of our present argument. If we\r\nare going to make the welfare of the children our criterion in these\r\nmatters, then our divorce law does in this direction already go too far.\r\nA husband or wife may do far more injury to the home by constantly\r\nneglecting it for the companionship of some outside person with whom no\r\n\"matrimonial offence\" is ever committed. Of course, if our divorce law\r\nexists mainly for the gratification of the fiercer sexual resentments,\r\nwell and good, but if that is so, let us abandon our pretence that\r\nmarriage is an institution for the establishment and protection of\r\nhomes. And while on the one hand existing divorce laws appear to be\r\nobsessed by sexual offences, other things of far more evil effect upon\r\nthe home go without a remedy. There are, for example, desertion,\r\ndomestic neglect, cruelty to the children drunkenness or harmful\r\ndrug-taking, indecency of living and uncontrollable extravagance. I\r\ncannot conceive how any logical mind, having once admitted the principle\r\nof divorce, can hesitate at making these entirely home-wrecking things\r\nthe basis of effective pleas. But in another direction, some strain of\r\nsentimentality in my nature makes me hesitate to go with the great\r\nmajority of divorce law reformers. I cannot bring myself to agree that\r\neither a long term of imprisonment or the misfortune of insanity should\r\nin itself justify a divorce. I admit the social convenience, but I wince\r\nat the thought of those tragic returns of the dispossessed. So far as\r\ninsanity goes, I perceive that the cruelty of the law would but endorse\r\nthe cruelty of nature. But I do not like men to endorse the cruelty of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, there is no decent-minded person nowadays but wants to\r\nput an end to that ugly blot upon our civilisation, the publication of\r\nwhatever is most spicy and painful in divorce court proceedings. It is\r\nan outrage which falls even more heavily on the innocent than on the\r\nguilty, and which has deterred hundreds of shy and delicate-minded\r\npeople from seeking legal remedies for nearly intolerable wrongs. The\r\nsort of person who goes willingly to the divorce court to-day is the\r\nsort of person who would love a screaming quarrel in a crowded street.\r\nThe emotional breach of the marriage bond is as private an affair as its\r\nconsummation, and it would be nearly as righteous to subject young\r\ncouples about to marry to a blustering cross-examination by some\r\nunderbred bully of a barrister upon their motives, and then to publish\r\nwhatever chance phrases in their answers appeared to be amusing in the\r\npress, as it is to publish contemporary divorce proceedings. The thing\r\nis a nastiness, a stream of social contagion and an extreme cruelty, and\r\nthere can be no doubt that whatever other result this British Royal\r\nCommission may have, there at least will be many sweeping alterations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1\r\n\r\n\"If Youth but Knew\" is the title of a book published some years ago, but\r\nstill with a quite living interest, by \"Kappa\"; it is the bitter\r\ncomplaint of a distressed senior against our educational system. He is\r\nhugely disappointed in the public-school boy, and more particularly in\r\none typical specimen. He is--if one might hazard a guess--an uncle\r\nbereft of great expectations. He finds an echo in thousands of other\r\ndistressed uncles and parents. They use the most divergent and\r\ninadequate forms of expression for this vague sense that the result has\r\nnot come out good enough; they put it contradictorily and often wrongly,\r\nbut the sense is widespread and real and justifiable and we owe a great\r\ndebt to \"Kappa\" for an accurate diagnosis of what in the aggregate\r\namounts to a grave national and social evil.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with \"Kappa's\" particular public-school boy is his unlit\r\nimagination, the apathetic commonness of his attitude to life at large.\r\nHe is almost stupidly not interested in the mysteries of material fact,\r\nnor in the riddles and great dramatic movements of history, indifferent\r\nto any form of beauty, and pedantically devoted to the pettiness of\r\ngames and clothing and social conduct. It is, in fact, chiefly by his\r\nstyle in these latter things, his extensive unilluminated knowledge of\r\nGreek and Latin, and his greater costliness, that he differs from a\r\nyoung carpenter or clerk. A young carpenter or clerk of the same\r\ntemperament would have no narrower prejudices nor outlook, no less\r\ncapacity for the discussion of broad questions and for imaginative\r\nthinking. And it has come to the mind of \"Kappa\" as a discovery, as an\r\nexceedingly remarkable and moving thing, a thing to cry aloud about,\r\nthat this should be so, that this is all that the best possible modern\r\neducation has achieved. He makes it more than a personal issue. He has\r\ncome to the conclusion that this is not an exceptional case at all, but\r\na fair sample of what our upper-class education does for the imagination\r\nof those who must presently take the lead among us. He declares plainly\r\nthat we are raising a generation of rulers and of those with whom the\r\nduty of initiative should chiefly reside, who have minds atrophied by\r\ndull studies and deadening suggestions, and he thinks that this is a\r\nmatter of the gravest concern for the future of this land and Empire. It\r\nis difficult to avoid agreeing with him either in his observation or in\r\nhis conclusion. Anyone who has seen much of undergraduates, or medical\r\nstudents, or Army candidates, and also of their social subordinates,\r\nmust be disposed to agree that the difference between the two classes is\r\nmainly in unimportant things--in polish, in manner, in superficialities\r\nof accent and vocabulary and social habit--and that their minds, in\r\nrange and power, are very much on a level. With an invincibly\r\naristocratic tradition we are failing altogether to produce a leader\r\nclass adequate to modern needs. The State is light-headed.\r\n\r\nBut while one agrees with \"Kappa\" and shares his alarm, one must confess\r\nthe remedies he considers indicated do not seem quite so satisfactory as\r\nhis diagnosis of the disease. He attacks the curriculum and tells us we\r\nmust reduce or revolutionise instruction and exercise in the dead\r\nlanguages, introduce a broader handling of history, a more inspiring\r\narrangement of scientific courses, and so forth. I wish, indeed, it were\r\npossible to believe that substituting biology for Greek prose\r\ncomposition or history with models and photographs and diagrams for\r\nLatin versification, would make any considerable difference in this\r\nmatter. For so one might discuss this question and still give no offence\r\nto a most amiable and influential class of men. But the roots of the\r\nevil, the ultimate cause of that typical young man's deadness, lie not\r\nat all in that direction. To indicate the direction in which it does lie\r\nis quite unavoidably to give offence to an indiscriminatingly sensitive\r\nclass. Yet there is need to speak plainly. This deadening of soul comes\r\nnot from the omission or inclusion of this specific subject or that; it\r\nis the effect of the general scholastic atmosphere. It is an atmosphere\r\nthat admits of no inspiration at all. It is an atmosphere from which\r\nliving stimulating influences have been excluded from which stimulating\r\nand vigorous personalities are now being carefully eliminated, and in\r\nwhich dull, prosaic men prevail invincibly. The explanation of the inert\r\ncommonness of \"Kappa's\" schoolboy lies not in his having learnt this or\r\nnot learnt that, but in the fact that from seven to twenty he has been\r\nin the intellectual shadow of a number of good-hearted, sedulously\r\nrespectable conscientiously manly, conforming, well-behaved men, who\r\nnever, to the knowledge of their pupils and the public, at any rate,\r\nthink strange thoughts do imaginative or romantic things, pay tribute to\r\nbeauty, laugh carelessly, or countenance any irregularity in the world.\r\nAll erratic and enterprising tendencies in him have been checked by\r\nthem and brought at last to nothing; and so he emerges a mere residuum\r\nof decent minor dispositions. The dullness of the scholastic atmosphere\r\nthe grey, intolerant mediocrity that is the natural or assumed quality\r\nof every upper-class schoolmaster, is the true cause of the spiritual\r\netiolation of \"Kappa's\" young friend.\r\n\r\nNow, it is a very grave thing, I know, to bring this charge against a\r\ngreat profession--to say, as I do say, that it is collectively and\r\nindividually dull. But someone has to do this sooner or later; we have\r\nrestrained ourselves and argued away from the question too long. There\r\nis, I allege, a great lack of vigorous and inspiring minds in our\r\nschools. Our upper-class schools are out of touch with the thought of\r\nthe time, in a backwater of intellectual apathy. We have no original or\r\nheroic school-teachers. Let me ask the reader frankly what part our\r\nleading headmasters play in his intellectual world; if when some\r\nprominent one among them speaks or writes or talks, he expects anything\r\nmore than platitudes and little things? Has he ever turned aside to\r\nlearn what this headmaster or that thought of any question that\r\ninterested him? Has he ever found freshness or power in a schoolmaster's\r\ndiscourse; or found a schoolmaster caring keenly for fine and beautiful\r\nthings? Who does not know the schoolmaster's trite, safe admirations,\r\nhis thin, evasive discussion, his sham enthusiasms for cricket, for\r\nfly-fishing, for perpendicular architecture, for boyish traits; his\r\ntimid refuge in \"good form,\" his deadly silences?\r\n\r\nAnd if we do not find him a refreshing and inspiring person, and his\r\nmind a fountain of thought in which we bathe and are restored, is it\r\nlikely our sons will? If the schoolmaster at large is grey and dull,\r\nshirking interesting topics and emphatic speech, what must he be like in\r\nthe monotonous class-room? These may seem wanton charges to some, but I\r\nam not speaking without my book. Monthly I am brought into close contact\r\nwith the pedagogic intelligence through the medium of three educational\r\nmagazines. A certain morbid habit against which I struggle in vain makes\r\nme read everything I catch a schoolmaster writing. I am, indeed, one of\r\nthe faithful band who read the Educational Supplement of the _Times_. In\r\nthese papers schoolmasters write about their business, lectures upon the\r\nquestions of their calling are reported at length, and a sort of invalid\r\ndiscussion moves with painful decorum through the correspondence column.\r\nThe scholastic mind so displayed in action fascinates me. It is like\r\nwatching a game of billiards with wooden cushes and beechwood balls.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2\r\n\r\nBut let me take one special instance. In a periodical, now no longer\r\nliving, called the _Independent Review_, there appeared some years ago a\r\nvery curious and typical contribution by the Headmaster of Dulwich,\r\nwhich I may perhaps use as an illustration of the mental habits which\r\nseem inseparably associated with modern scholastic work. It is called\r\n\"English Ideas on Education,\" and it begins--trite, imitative,\r\nundistinguished--thus:\r\n\r\n\"The most important question in a country is that of education, and the\r\nmost important people in a country are those who educate its\r\ninhabitants. Others have most of the present in their hands: those who\r\neducate have all the future. With the present is bound up all the\r\nhappiness only of the utterly selfish and the thoughtless among mankind;\r\non the future rest all the thoughts of every parent and every wise man\r\nand patriot.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the opening of a boy's essay. And from first to last this\r\nremarkable composition is at or below that level. It is an entirely\r\ninconclusive paper, it is impossible to understand why it was written;\r\nit quotes nothing it says nothing about and was probably written in\r\nignorance of \"Kappa\" or any other modern contributor to English ideas,\r\nand it occupied about six and a quarter of the large-type pages of this\r\nnow vanished _Independent Review_. \"English Ideas on Education\"!--this\r\nvery brevity is eloquent, the more so since the style is by no means\r\nsuccinct. It must be read to be believed. It is quite extraordinarily\r\nnon-prehensile in quality and substance nothing is gripped and\r\nmaintained and developed; it is like the passing of a lax hand over the\r\nsurfaces of disarranged things. It is difficult to read, because one's\r\nmind slips over it and emerges too soon at the end, mildly puzzled\r\nthough incurious still as to what it is all about. One perceives Mr.\r\nGilkes through a fog dimly thinking that Greek has something vital to do\r\nwith \"a knowledge of language and man,\" that the classical master is in\r\nsome mysterious way superior to the science man and more imaginative,\r\nand that science men ought not to be worried with the Greek that is too\r\nhigh for them; and he seems, too, to be under the odd illusion that \"on\r\nall this\" Englishmen \"seem now to be nearly in agreement,\" and also on\r\nthe opinion that games are a little overdone and that civic duties and\r\nthe use of the rifle ought to be taught. Statements are made--the sort\r\nof statements that are suffered in an atmosphere where there is no\r\nswift, fierce opposition to be feared; they frill out into vague\r\nqualifications and butt gently against other partially contradictory\r\nstatements. There is a classification of minds--the sort of\r\nclassification dear to the Y.M.C.A. essayists, made for the purposes of\r\nthe essay and unknown to psychology. There are, we are told, accurate\r\nunimaginative, ingenious minds capable of science and kindred vulgar\r\nthings (such was Archimedes), and vague, imaginative minds, with the\r\ngift for language and for the treatment of passion and the higher\r\nindefinable things (such as Homer and Mr. Gilkes), and, somehow, this\r\njustifies those who are destined for \"science\" in dropping Greek.\r\nCertain \"considerations,\" however, loom inconclusively upon this\r\nissue--rather like interested spectators of a street fight in a fog. For\r\nexample, to learn a language is valuable \"in proportion as the nation\r\nspeaking it is great\"--a most empty assertion; and \"no languages are so\r\ngood,\" for the purpose of improving style, \"as the exact and beautiful\r\nlanguages of Rome and Greece.\"\r\n\r\nIs it not time at least that this last, this favourite but threadbare\r\narticle of the schoolmaster's creed was put away for good? Everyone who\r\nhas given any attention to this question must be aware that the\r\nintellectual gesture is entirely different in highly inflected languages\r\nsuch as Greek and Latin and in so uninflected a language as English,\r\nthat learning Greek to improve one's English style is like learning to\r\nswim in order to fence better, and that familiarity with Greek seems\r\nonly too often to render a man incapable of clear, strong expression in\r\nEnglish at all. Yet Mr. Gilkes can permit this old assertion, so dear\r\nto country rectors and the classical scholar, to appear within a\r\ncolumn's distance of such style as this:\r\n\r\n\"It is now understood that every subject is valuable, if it is properly\r\ntaught; it will perform that which, as follows from the accounts given\r\nabove of the aim of education, is the work most important in the case of\r\nboys--that is, it will draw out their faculties and make them useful in\r\nthe world, alert, trained in industry, and able to understand, so far as\r\ntheir school lessons educated them, and make themselves master of any\r\nsubject set before them.\"\r\n\r\nThis quotation is conclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3\r\n\r\nI am haunted by a fear that the careless reader will think I am writing\r\nagainst upper-class schoolmasters. I am, it is undeniable, writing\r\nagainst their dullness, but it is, I hold, a dullness that is imposed\r\nupon them by the conditions under which they live. Indeed, I believe,\r\ncould I put the thing directly to the profession--\"Do you not yourselves\r\nfeel needlessly limited and dull?\"--should receive a majority of\r\naffirmative responses. We have, as a nation, a certain ideal of what a\r\nschoolmaster must be; to that he must by art or nature approximate, and\r\nthere is no help for it but to alter our ideal. Nothing else of any wide\r\nvalue can be done until that is done.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the received ideal omits a most necessary condition.\r\nWe do not insist upon a headmaster or indeed any of our academic leaders\r\nand dignitaries, being a man of marked intellectual character, a man of\r\nintellectual distinction. It is assumed, rather lightly in many cases,\r\nthat he has done \"good work,\" as they say--the sort of good work that is\r\nusually no good at all, that increases nothing, changes nothing,\r\nstimulates no one, leads no whither. That, surely, must be altered. We\r\nmust see to it that our leading schoolmasters at any rate must be men of\r\ninsight and creative intelligence, men who could at a pinch write a good\r\nnovel or produce illuminating criticism or take an original part in\r\ntheological or philosophical discussion, or do any of these minor\r\nthings. They must be authentic men, taking a line of their own and\r\ncapable of intellectual passion. They should be able to make their mark\r\noutside the school, if only to show they carry a living soul into it. As\r\nthings are, nothing is so fatal to a schoolmaster's career as to do\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nAnd closely related to this omission is our extreme insistence upon what\r\nwe call high moral character, meaning, really, something very like an\r\nentire absence of moral character. We insist upon tact, conformity, and\r\nan unblemished record. Now, in these days, of warring opinion, these\r\ndays of gigantic, strange issues that cannot possibly be expressed in\r\nthe formulae of the smaller times that have gone before, tact is\r\nevasion, conformity formality, and silence an unblemished record, mere\r\nevidence of the damning burial of a talent of life. The sort of man into\r\nwhose hands we give our sons' minds must never have experimented morally\r\nor thought at all freely or vigorously about, for example, God,\r\nSocialism, the Mosaic account of the Creation, social procedure,\r\nRepublicanism, beauty, love, or, indeed, about anything likely to\r\ninterest an intelligent adolescent. At the approach of all such things\r\nhe must have acquired the habit of the modest cough, the infectious\r\ntrick of the nice evasion. How can \"Kappa\" expect inspiration from the\r\ndecorous resultants who satisfy these conditions? What brand can ever be\r\nlit at altars that have borne no fire? And you find the secondary\r\nschoolmaster who complies with these restrictions becoming the zealous\r\nand grateful agent of the tendencies that have made him what he is,\r\nconverting into a practice those vague dreads of idiosyncrasy, of\r\npositive acts and new ideas, that dictated the choice of him and his\r\nrule of life. His moral teaching amounts to this: to inculcate\r\ntruth-telling about small matters and evasion about large, and to\r\ncultivate a morbid obsession in the necessary dawn of sexual\r\nconsciousness. So far from wanting to stimulate the imagination, he\r\nhates and dreads it. I find him perpetually haunted by a ridiculous fear\r\nthat boys will \"do something,\" and in his terror seeking whatever is\r\ndull and unstimulating and tiring in intellectual work, clipping their\r\nreading, censoring their periodicals, expurgating their classics,\r\nsubstituting the stupid grind of organised \"games\" for natural,\r\nimaginative play, persecuting loafers--and so achieving his end and\r\nturning out at last, clean-looking, passively well-behaved, apathetic,\r\nobliterated young men, with the nicest manners and no spark of\r\ninitiative at all, quite safe not to \"do anything\" for ever.\r\n\r\nI submit this may be a very good training for polite servants, but it is\r\nnot the way to make masters in the world. If we English believe we are\r\nindeed a masterful people, we must be prepared to expose our children to\r\nmore and more various stimulations than we do; they must grow up free,\r\nbold, adventurous, initiated, even if they have to take more risks in\r\nthe doing of that. An able and stimulating teacher is as rare as a fine\r\nartist, and is a thing worth having for your son, even at the price of\r\nshocking your wife by his lack of respect for that magnificent\r\ncompromise, the Establishment, or you by his Socialism or by his\r\nCatholicism or Darwinism, or even by his erroneous choice of ties and\r\ncollars. Boys who are to be free, masterly men must hear free men\r\ntalking freely of religion, of philosophy, of conduct. They must have\r\nheard men of this opinion and that, putting what they believe before\r\nthem with all the courage of conviction. They must have an idea of will\r\nprevailing over form. It is far more important that boys should learn\r\nfrom original, intellectually keen men than they should learn from\r\nperfectly respectable men, or perfectly orthodox men, or perfectly nice\r\nmen. The vital thing to consider about your son's schoolmaster is\r\nwhether he talked lifeless twaddle yesterday by way of a lesson, and not\r\nwhether he loved unwisely or was born of poor parents, or was seen\r\nwearing a frock-coat in combination with a bowler, or confessed he\r\ndoubted the Apostles' Creed, or called himself a Socialist, or any\r\ndisgraceful thing like that, so many years ago. It is that sort of thing\r\n\"Kappa\" must invert if he wants a change in our public schools. You may\r\narrange and rearrange curricula, abolish Greek, substitute \"science\"--it\r\nwill not matter a rap. Even those model canoes of yours, \"Kappa,\" will\r\nbe wasted if you still insist upon model schoolmasters. So long as we\r\nrequire our schoolmasters to be politic, conforming, undisturbing men,\r\nsetting up Polonius as an ideal for them, so long will their influence\r\ndeaden the souls of our sons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENDOWMENT OF MOTHERHOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nSome few years ago the Fabian Society, which has been so efficient in\r\nkeeping English Socialism to the lines of \"artfulness and the\r\n'eighties,\" refused to have anything to do with the Endowment of\r\nMotherhood. Subsequently it repented and produced a characteristic\r\npamphlet in which the idea was presented with a sort of minimising\r\nfurtiveness as a mean little extension of outdoor relief. These Fabian\r\nSocialists, instead of being the daring advanced people they are\r\nsupposed to be, are really in many things twenty years behind the times.\r\nThere need be nothing shamefaced about the presentation of the Endowment\r\nof Motherhood. There is nothing shameful about it. It is a plain and\r\nsimple idea for which the mind of the man in the street has now been\r\nvery completely prepared. It has already crept into social legislation\r\nto the extent of thirty shillings.\r\n\r\nI suppose if one fact has been hammered into us in the past two decades\r\nmore than any other it is this: that the supply of children is falling\r\noff in the modern State; that births, and particularly good-quality\r\nbirths, are not abundant enough; that the birth-rate, and particularly\r\nthe good-class birth-rate, falls steadily below the needs of our future.\r\n\r\nIf no one else has said a word about this important matter, ex-President\r\nRoosevelt would have sufficed to shout it to the ends of the earth.\r\nEvery civilised community is drifting towards \"race-suicide\" as Rome\r\ndrifted into \"race-suicide\" at the climax of her empire.\r\n\r\nWell, it is absurd to go on building up a civilisation with a dwindling\r\nsupply of babies in the cradles--and these not of the best possible\r\nsort--and so I suppose there is hardly an intelligent person in the\r\nEnglish-speaking communities who has not thought of some possible\r\nremedy--from the naive scoldings of Mr. Roosevelt and the more stolid of\r\nthe periodicals to sane and intelligible legislative projects.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the fall in the birth-rate are obvious enough. It is a\r\nnecessary consequence of the individualistic competition of modern life.\r\nPeople talk of modern women \"shirking\" motherhood, but it would be a\r\nsilly sort of universe in which a large proportion of women had any\r\nnatural and instinctive desire to shirk motherhood, and, I believe, a\r\nhuge proportion of modern women are as passionately predisposed towards\r\nmotherhood as ever women were. But modern conditions conspire to put a\r\nheavy handicap upon parentage and an enormous premium upon the partial\r\nor complete evasion of offspring, and that is where the clue to the\r\ntrouble lies. Our social arrangements discourage parentage very heavily,\r\nand the rational thing for a statesman to do in the matter is not to\r\ngrow eloquent, but to do intelligent things to minimise that\r\ndiscouragement.\r\n\r\nConsider the case of an energetic young man and an energetic young woman\r\nin our modern world. So long as they remain \"unencumbered\" they can\r\nsubsist on a comparatively small income and find freedom and leisure to\r\nwatch for and follow opportunities of self-advancement; they can travel,\r\nget knowledge and experience, make experiments, succeed. One might\r\nalmost say the conditions of success and self-development in the modern\r\nworld are to defer marriage as long as possible, and after that to defer\r\nparentage as long as possible. And even when there is a family there is\r\nthe strongest temptation to limit it to three or four children at the\r\noutside. Parents who can give three children any opportunity in life\r\nprefer to do that than turn out, let us say, eight ill-trained children\r\nat a disadvantage, to become the servants and unsuccessful competitors\r\nof the offspring of the restrained. That fact bites us all; it does not\r\nrequire a search. It is all very well to rant about \"race-suicide,\" but\r\nthere are the clear, hard conditions of contemporary circumstances for\r\nall but the really rich, and so patent are they that I doubt if all the\r\neloquence of Mr. Roosevelt and its myriad echoes has added a thousand\r\nbabies to the eugenic wealth of the English-speaking world.\r\n\r\nModern married people, and particularly those in just that capable\r\nmiddle class from which children are most urgently desirable from the\r\nstatesman's point of view, are going to have one or two children to\r\nplease themselves but they are not going to have larger families under\r\nexisting conditions, though all the ex-Presidents and all the pulpits in\r\nthe world clamour together for them to do so.\r\n\r\nIf having and rearing children is a private affair, then no one has any\r\nright to revile small families; if it is a public service, then the\r\nparent is justified in looking to the State to recognise that service\r\nand offer some compensation for the worldly disadvantages it entails. He\r\nis justified in saying that while his unencumbered rival wins past him\r\nhe is doing the State the most precious service in the world by rearing\r\nand educating a family, and that the State has become his debtor.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the modern State has got to pay for its children if it\r\nreally wants them--and more particularly it has to pay for the children\r\nof good homes.\r\n\r\nThe alternative to that is racial replacement and social decay. That is\r\nthe essential idea conveyed by this phrase, the Endowment of Motherhood.\r\n\r\nNow, how is the paying to be done? That needs a more elaborate answer,\r\nof which I will give here only the roughest, crudest suggestion.\r\n\r\nProbably it would be found best that the payment should be made to the\r\nmother, as the administrator of the family budget, that its amount\r\nshould be made dependent upon the quality of the home in which the\r\nchildren are being reared, upon their health and physical development,\r\nand upon their educational success. Be it remembered, we do not want any\r\nchildren; we want good-quality children. The amount to be paid, I would\r\nparticularly point out, should vary with the standing of the home.\r\nPeople of that excellent class which spends over a hundred a year on\r\neach child ought to get about that much from the State, and people of\r\nthe class which spends five shillings a week per head on them would get\r\nabout that, and so on. And if these payments were met by a special\r\nincome tax there would be no social injustice whatever in such an\r\nunequality of payment. Each social stratum would pay according to its\r\nprosperity, and the only redistribution that would in effect occur would\r\nbe that the childless people of each class would pay for the children of\r\nthat class. The childless family and the small family would pay equally\r\nwith the large family, incomes being equal, but they would receive in\r\nproportions varying with the health and general quality of their\r\nchildren. That, I think, gives the broad principles upon which the\r\npayments would be made.\r\n\r\nOf course, if these subsidies resulted in too rapid a rise in the\r\nbirth-rate, it would be practicable to diminish the inducement; and if,\r\non the other hand, the birth-rate still fell, it would be easy to\r\nincrease the inducement until it sufficed.\r\n\r\nThat concisely is the idea of the Endowment of Motherhood. I believe\r\nfirmly that some such arrangement is absolutely necessary to the\r\ncontinuous development of the modern State. These proposals arise so\r\nobviously out of the needs of our time that I cannot understand any\r\nreally intelligent opposition to them. I can, however, understand a\r\npartial and silly application of them. It is most important that our\r\ngood-class families should be endowed, but the whole tendency of the\r\ntimid and disingenuous progressivism of our time, which is all mixed up\r\nwith ideas of charity and aggressive benevolence to the poor, would be\r\nto apply this--as that Fabian tract I mention does--only to the poor\r\nmother. To endow poor and bad-class motherhood and leave other people\r\nseverely alone would be a proceeding so supremely idiotic, so harmful to\r\nour national quality, as to be highly probable in the present state of\r\nour public intelligence. It comes quite on a level with the policy of\r\nstarving middle-class education that has left us with nearly the worst\r\neducated middle class in Western Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Endowment of Motherhood does not attract the bureaucratic type of\r\nreformer because it offers a minimum chance of meddlesome interference\r\nwith people's lives. There would be no chance of \"seeking out\" anybody\r\nand applying benevolent but grim compulsions on the strength of it. In\r\nspite of its wide scope it would be much less of a public nuisance than\r\nthat Wet Children's Charter, which exasperates me every time I pass a\r\npublic-house on a rainy night. But, on the other hand, there would be an\r\nenormous stimulus to people to raise the quality of their homes, study\r\ninfantile hygiene, seek out good schools for them--and do their duty as\r\nall good parents naturally want to do now--if only economic forces were\r\nnot so pitilessly against them--thoroughly and well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCTORS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that extravagant world of which I dream, in which people will live in\r\ndelightful cottages and ground rents will serve instead of rates, and\r\neveryone will have a chance of being happy--in that impossible world all\r\ndoctors will be members of one great organisation for the public health,\r\nwith all or most of their income guaranteed to them: I doubt if there\r\nwill be any private doctors at all.\r\n\r\nHeaven forbid I should seem to write a word against doctors as they are.\r\nDaily I marvel at the wonders the general practitioner achieves, having\r\nregard to the difficulties of his position.\r\n\r\nBut I cannot hide from myself, and I do not intend to hide from anyone\r\nelse, my firm persuasion that the services the general practitioner is\r\nable to render us are not one-tenth so effectual as they might be if,\r\ninstead of his being a private adventurer, he were a member of a sanely\r\norganised public machine. Consider what his training and equipment are,\r\nconsider the peculiar difficulties of his work, and then consider for a\r\nmoment what better conditions might be invented, and perhaps you will\r\nnot think my estimate of one-tenth an excessive understatement in this\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nNearly the whole of our medical profession and most of our apparatus for\r\nteaching and training doctors subsist on strictly commercial lines by\r\nearning fees. This chief source of revenue is eked out by the wanton\r\ncharity of old women, and conspicuous subscriptions by popularity\r\nhunters, and a small but growing contribution (in the salaries of\r\nmedical officers of health and so forth) from the public funds. But the\r\nfact remains that for the great mass of the medical profession there is\r\nno living to be got except at a salary for hospital practice or by\r\nearning fees in receiving or attending upon private cases.\r\n\r\nSo long as a doctor is learning or adding to knowledge, he earns\r\nnothing, and the common, unintelligent man does not see why he should\r\nearn anything. So that a doctor who has no religious passion for poverty\r\nand self-devotion gets through the minimum of training and learning as\r\nquickly and as cheaply as possible, and does all he can to fill up the\r\nrest of his time in passing rapidly from case to case. The busier he\r\nkeeps, the less his leisure for thought and learning, the richer he\r\ngrows, and the more he is esteemed. His four or five years of hasty,\r\ncrowded study are supposed to give him a complete and final knowledge of\r\nthe treatment of every sort of disease, and he goes on year after year,\r\noften without co-operation, working mechanically in the common incidents\r\nof practice, births, cases of measles and whooping cough, and so forth,\r\nand blundering more or less in whatever else turns up.\r\n\r\nThere are no public specialists to whom he can conveniently refer the\r\ndifficulties he constantly encounters; only in the case of rich patients\r\nis the specialist available; there are no properly organised information\r\nbureaus for him, and no means whatever of keeping him informed upon\r\nprogress and discovery in medical science. He is not even required to\r\nset apart a month or so in every two or three years in order to return\r\nto lectures and hospitals and refresh his knowledge. Indeed, the income\r\nof the average general practitioner would not permit of such a thing,\r\nand almost the only means of contact between him and current thought\r\nlies in the one or other of our two great medical weeklies to which he\r\nhappens to subscribe.\r\n\r\nNow just as I have nothing but praise for the average general\r\npractitioner, so I have nothing but praise and admiration for those\r\nstalwart-looking publications. Without them I can imagine nothing but\r\nthe most terrible intellectual atrophy among our medical men. But since\r\nthey are private properties run for profit they have to pay, and half\r\ntheir bulk consists of the brilliantly written advertisements of new\r\ndrugs and apparatus. They give much knowledge, they do much to ventilate\r\nperplexing questions, but a broadly conceived and properly endowed\r\nweekly circular could, I believe, do much more. At any rate, in my\r\nUtopia this duty of feeding up the general practitioners will not be\r\nleft to private enterprise.\r\n\r\nBehind the first line of my medical army will be a second line of able\r\nmen constantly digesting new research for its practical\r\nneeds--correcting, explaining, announcing; and, in addition, a force of\r\npublic specialists to whom every difficulty in diagnosis will be at once\r\nreferred. And there will be a properly organised system of reliefs that\r\nwill allow the general practitioner and his right hand, the nurse, to\r\ncome back to the refreshment of study before his knowledge and mind have\r\ngot rusty. But then my Utopia is a Socialistic system. Under our present\r\nsystem of competitive scramble, under any system that reduces medical\r\npractice to mere fee-hunting nothing of this sort is possible.\r\n\r\nThen in my Utopia, for every medical man who was mainly occupied in\r\npractice, I would have another who was mainly occupied in or about\r\nresearch. People hear so much about modern research that they do not\r\nrealise how entirely inadequate it is in amount and equipment. Our\r\ngeneral public is still too stupid to understand the need and value of\r\nsustained investigations in any branch of knowledge at all. In spite of\r\nall the lessons of the last century, it still fails to realise how\r\ndiscovery and invention enrich the community and how paying an\r\ninvestment is the public employment of clever people to think and\r\nexperiment for the benefit of all. It still expects to get a Newton or a\r\nJoule for \u00a3800 a year, and requires him to conduct his researches in the\r\nmargin of time left over when he has got through his annual eighty or\r\nninety lectures. It imagines discoveries are a sort of inspiration that\r\ncomes when professors are running to catch trains. It seems incapable of\r\nimagining how enormous are the untried possibilities of research. Of\r\ncourse, if you will only pay a handful of men salaries at which the cook\r\nof any large London hotel would turn up his nose, you cannot expect to\r\nhave the master minds of the world at your service; and save for a few\r\nindependent or devoted men, therefore, it is not reasonable to suppose\r\nthat such a poor little dribble of medical research as is now going on\r\nis in the hands of persons of much more than average mental equipment.\r\nHow can it be?\r\n\r\nOne hears a lot of the rigorous research into the problem of cancer that\r\nis now going on. Does the reader realise that all the men in the whole\r\nworld who are giving any considerable proportion of their time to this\r\ncancer research would pack into a very small room, that they are\r\nworking in little groups without any properly organised system of\r\nintercommunication, and that half of them are earning less than a\r\nquarter of the salary of a Bond Street shopwalker by those vastly\r\nimportant inquiries? Not one cancer case in twenty thousand is being\r\nproperly described and reported. And yet, in comparison with other\r\ndiseases, cancer is being particularly well attended to.\r\n\r\nThe general complacency with the progress in knowledge we have made and\r\nare making is ridiculously unjustifiable. Enormous things were no doubt\r\ndone in the nineteenth century in many fields of knowledge, but all that\r\nwas done was out of all proportion petty in comparison with what might\r\nhave been done. I suppose the whole of the unprecedented progress in\r\nmaterial knowledge of the nineteenth century was the work of two or\r\nthree thousand men, who toiled against opposition, spite and endless\r\ndisadvantages, without proper means of intercommunication and with\r\nwretched facilities for experiment. Such discoveries as were\r\ndistinctively medical were the work of only a few hundred men. Now,\r\nsuppose instead of that scattered band of un-co-ordinated workers a\r\ngreat army of hundreds of thousands of well-paid men; suppose, for\r\ninstance, the community had kept as many scientific and medical\r\ninvestigators as it has bookmakers and racing touts and men about\r\ntown--should we not know a thousand times as much as we do about disease\r\nand health and strength and power?\r\n\r\nBut these are Utopian questionings. The sane, practical man shakes his\r\nhead, smiles pityingly at my dreamy impracticability, and passes them\r\nby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AGE OF SPECIALISATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is something of the phonograph in all of us, but in the sort of\r\neminent person who makes public speeches about education and reading,\r\nand who gives away prizes and opens educational institutions, there\r\nseems to be little else but gramophone.\r\n\r\nThese people always say the same things, and say them in the same note.\r\nAnd why should they do that if they are really individuals?\r\n\r\nThere is, I cannot but suspect, in the mysterious activities that\r\nunderlie life, some trade in records for these distinguished\r\ngramophones, and it is a trade conducted upon cheap and wholesale lines.\r\nThere must be in these demiurgic profundities a rapid manufacture of\r\ninnumerable thousands of that particular speech about \"scrappy reading,\"\r\nand that contrast of \"modern\" with \"serious\" literature, that babbles\r\nabout in the provinces so incessantly. Gramophones thinly disguised as\r\nbishops, gramophones still more thinly disguised as eminent statesmen,\r\ngramophones K.C.B. and gramophones F.R.S. have brazened it at us time\r\nafter time, and will continue to brazen it to our grandchildren when we\r\nare dead and all our poor protests forgotten. And almost equally popular\r\nin their shameless mouths is the speech that declares this present age\r\nto be an age of specialisation. We all know the profound droop of the\r\neminent person's eyelids as he produces that discovery, the edifying\r\ndeductions or the solemn warnings he unfolds from this proposition, and\r\nall the dignified, inconclusive rigmarole of that cylinder. And it is\r\nnonsense from beginning to end.\r\n\r\nThis is most distinctly _not_ an age of specialisation. There has hardly\r\nbeen an age in the whole course of history less so than the present. A\r\nfew moments of reflection will suffice to demonstrate that. This is\r\nbeyond any precedent an age of change, change in the appliances of life,\r\nin the average length of life, in the general temper of life; and the\r\ntwo things are incompatible. It is only under fixed conditions that you\r\ncan have men specialising.\r\n\r\nThey specialise extremely, for example, under such conditions as one had\r\nin Hindustan up to the coming of the present generation. There the metal\r\nworker or the cloth worker, the wheelwright or the druggist of yesterday\r\ndid his work under almost exactly the same conditions as his predecessor\r\ndid it five hundred years before. He had the same resources, the same\r\ntools, the same materials; he made the same objects for the same ends.\r\nWithin the narrow limits thus set him he carried work to a fine\r\nperfection; his hand, his mental character were subdued to his medium.\r\nHis dress and bearing even were distinctive; he was, in fact, a highly\r\nspecialised man. He transmitted his difference to his sons. Caste was\r\nthe logical expression in the social organisation of this state of high\r\nspecialisation, and, indeed, what else is caste or any definite class\r\ndistinctions but that? But the most obvious fact of the present time is\r\nthe disappearance of caste and the fluctuating uncertainty of all class\r\ndistinctions.\r\n\r\nIf one looks into the conditions of industrial employment specialisation\r\nwill be found to linger just in proportion as a trade has remained\r\nunaffected by inventions and innovation. The building trade, for\r\nexample, is a fairly conservative one. A brick wall is made to-day much\r\nas it was made two hundred years ago, and the bricklayer is in\r\nconsequence a highly skilled and inadaptable specialist. No one who has\r\nnot passed through a long and tedious training can lay bricks properly.\r\nAnd it needs a specialist to plough a field with horses or to drive a\r\ncab through the streets of London. Thatchers, old-fashioned cobblers,\r\nand hand workers are all specialised to a degree no new modern calling\r\nrequires. With machinery skill disappears and unspecialised intelligence\r\ncomes in. Any generally intelligent man can learn in a day or two to\r\ndrive an electric tram, fix up an electric lighting installation, or\r\nguide a building machine or a steam plough. He must be, of course, much\r\nmore generally intelligent than the average bricklayer, but he needs far\r\nless specialised skill. To repair machinery requires, of course, a\r\nspecial sort of knowledge, but not a special sort of training.\r\n\r\nIn no way is this disappearance of specialisation more marked than in\r\nmilitary and naval affairs. In the great days of Greece and Rome war was\r\na special calling, requiring a special type of man. In the Middle Ages\r\nwar had an elaborate technique, in which the footman played the part of\r\nan unskilled labourer, and even within a period of a hundred years it\r\ntook a long period of training and discipline before the common\r\ndiscursive man could be converted into the steady soldier. Even to-day\r\ntraditions work powerfully, through extravagance of uniform, and through\r\nsurvivals of that mechanical discipline that was so important in the\r\ndays of hand-to-hand fighting, to keep the soldier something other than\r\na man. For all the lessons of the Boer war we are still inclined to\r\nbelieve that the soldier has to be something severely parallel, carrying\r\na rifle he fires under orders, obedient to the pitch of absolute\r\nabnegation of his private intelligence. We still think that our officers\r\nhave, like some very elaborate and noble sort of performing animal, to\r\nbe \"trained.\" They learn to fight with certain specified \"arms\" and\r\nweapons, instead of developing intelligence enough to use anything that\r\ncomes to hand.\r\n\r\nBut, indeed, when a really great European war does come and lets loose\r\nmotor-cars, bicycles, wireless telegraphy, aeroplanes, new projectiles\r\nof every size and shape, and a multitude of ingenious persons upon the\r\npreposterously vast hosts of conscription, the military caste will be\r\nmissing within three months of the beginning, and the inventive,\r\nversatile, intelligent man will have come to his own.\r\n\r\nAnd what is true of a military caste is equally true of a special\r\ngoverning class such as our public schools maintain.\r\n\r\nThe misunderstanding that has given rise to this proposition that this\r\nis an age of specialisation, and through that no end of mischief in\r\nmisdirected technical education and the like, is essentially a confusion\r\nbetween specialisation and the division of labour. No doubt this is an\r\nage when everything makes for wider and wider co-operations. Work that\r\nwas once done by one highly specialised man--the making of a watch, for\r\nexample--is now turned out wholesale by elaborate machinery, or effected\r\nin great quantities by the contributed efforts of a number of people.\r\nEach of these people may bring a highly developed intelligence to bear\r\nfor a time upon the special problem in hand, but that is quite a\r\ndifferent thing from specialising to do that thing.\r\n\r\nThis is typically shown in scientific research. The problem or the parts\r\nof problems upon which the inquiry of an individual man is concentrated\r\nare often much narrower than the problems that occupied Faraday or\r\nDalton, and yet the hard and fast lines that once divided physicist from\r\nchemist, or botanist from pathologist have long since gone. Professor\r\nFarmer, the botanist, investigates cancer, and the ordinary educated\r\nman, familiar though he is with their general results, would find it\r\nhard to say which were the chemists and which the physicists among\r\nProfessors Dewar and Ramsey Lord Rayleigh and Curie. The classification\r\nof sciences that was such a solemn business to our grandfathers is now\r\nmerely a mental obstruction.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to glance for a moment at the possible source of this\r\nmischievous confusion between specialisation and the division of labour.\r\nI have already glanced at the possibility of a diabolical world\r\nmanufacturing gramophone records for our bishops and statesmen and\r\nsuchlike leaders of thought, but if we dismiss that as a merely elegant\r\ntrope, I must confess I think it is the influence of Herbert Spencer.\r\nHis philosophy is pervaded by an insistence which is, I think, entirely\r\nwithout justification, that the universe, and every sort of thing in it,\r\nmoves from the simple and homogeneous to the complex and heterogeneous.\r\nAn unwary man obsessed with that idea would be very likely to assume\r\nwithout consideration that men were less specialised in a barbaric state\r\nof society than they are to-day. I think I have given reasons for\r\nbelieving that the reverse of this is nearer the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIS THERE A PEOPLE?\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the great personifications that have dominated the mind of man,\r\nthe greatest, the most marvellous, the most impossible and the most\r\nincredible, is surely the People, that impalpable monster to which the\r\nworld has consecrated its political institutions for the last hundred\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful now whether this stupendous superstition has reached its\r\ngrand climacteric, and there can be little or no dispute that it is\r\ndestined to play a prominent part in the history of mankind for many\r\nyears to come. There is a practical as well as a philosophical interest,\r\ntherefore, in a note or so upon the attributes of this legendary being.\r\nI write \"legendary,\" but thereby I display myself a sceptic. To a very\r\nlarge number of people the People is one of the profoundest realities in\r\nlife. They believe--what exactly do they believe about the people?\r\n\r\nWhen they speak of the People they certainly mean something more than\r\nthe whole mass of individuals in a country lumped together. That is the\r\npeople, a mere varied aggregation of persons, moved by no common motive,\r\na complex interplay. The People, as the believer understands the word,\r\nis something more mysterious than that. The People is something that\r\noverrides and is added to the individualities that make up the people.\r\nIt is, as it were, itself an individuality of a higher order--as indeed,\r\nits capital \"P\" displays. It has a will of its own which is not the\r\nwill of any particular person in it, it has a power of purpose and\r\njudgment of a superior sort. It is supposed to be the underlying reality\r\nof all national life and the real seat of all public religious emotion.\r\nUnfortunately, it lacks powers of expression, and so there is need of\r\nrulers and interpreters. If they express it well in law and fact, in\r\nbook and song, they prosper under its mysterious approval; if they do\r\nnot, it revolts or forgets or does something else of an equally\r\nannihilatory sort. That, briefly, is the idea of the People. My modest\r\nthesis is that there exists nothing of the sort, that the world of men\r\nis entirely made up of the individuals that compose it, and that the\r\ncollective action is just the algebraic sum of all individual actions.\r\n\r\nHow far the opposite opinion may go, one must talk to intelligent\r\nAmericans or read the contemporary literature of the first French\r\nRevolution to understand. I find, for example, so typical a young\r\nAmerican as the late Frank Norris roundly asserting that it is the\r\nPeople to whom we are to ascribe the triumphant emergence of the name of\r\nShakespeare from the ruck of his contemporaries and the passage in which\r\nthis assertion is made is fairly representative of the general\r\nexpression of this sort of mysticism. \"One must keep one's faith in the\r\nPeople--the Plain People, the Burgesses, the Grocers--else of all men\r\nthe artists are most miserable and their teachings vain. Let us admit\r\nand concede that this belief is ever so sorely tried at times.... But in\r\nthe end, and at last, they will listen to the true note and discriminate\r\nbetween it and the false.\" And then he resorts to italics to emphasise:\r\n\"_In the last analysis the People are always right_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it was that still more typical American, Abraham Lincoln, who\r\ndeclared his equal confidence in the political wisdom of this collective\r\nbeing. \"You can fool all the people some of the time and some of the\r\npeople all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.\"\r\nThe thing is in the very opening words of the American Constitution, and\r\nTheodore Parker calls it \"the American idea\" and pitches a still higher\r\nnote: \"A government of all the people, by all the people, for all the\r\npeople; a government of all the principles of eternal justice, _the\r\nunchanging law of God.\"_\r\n\r\nIt is unavoidable that a collective wisdom distinct from any individual\r\nand personal one is intended in these passages. Mr. Norris, for example,\r\nnever figured to himself a great wave of critical discrimination\r\nsweeping through the ranks of the various provision trades and a\r\nmultitude of simple, plain burgesses preferring Shakespeare and setting\r\nMarlowe aside. Such a particularisation of his statement would have at\r\nonce reduced it to absurdity. Nor does any American see the people\r\nparticularised in that way. They believe in the People one and\r\nindivisible, a simple, mystical being, which pervades and dominates the\r\ncommunity and determines its final collective consequences.\r\n\r\nNow upon the belief that there is a People rests a large part of the\r\npolitical organisation of the modern world. The idea was one of the\r\nchief fruits of the speculations of the eighteenth century, and the\r\nAmerican Constitution is its most perfect expression. One turns,\r\ntherefore, inevitably to the American instance, not because it is the\r\nonly one, but because there is the thing in its least complicated form.\r\nWe have there an almost exactly logical realisation of this belief. The\r\nwhole political machine is designed and expressed to register the\r\nPeople's will, literature is entirely rewarded and controlled by the\r\neffectual suffrages of the bookseller's counter, science (until private\r\nendowment intervened) was in the hands of the State Legislatures, and\r\nreligion the concern of the voluntary congregations.\r\n\r\nOn the assumption that there is a People there could be no better state\r\nof affairs. You and I and everyone, except for a vote or a book, or a\r\nservice now and then, can go about our business, you to your grocery and\r\nI to mine, and the direction of the general interests rests safe in the\r\nPeople's hands. Now that is by no means a caricature of the attitude of\r\nmind of many educated Americans. You find they have little or nothing to\r\ndo with actual politics, and are inclined to regard the professional\r\npolitician with a certain contempt; they trouble their heads hardly at\r\nall about literature, and they contemplate the general religious\r\ncondition of the population with absolute unconcern. It is not that they\r\nare unpatriotic or morally trivial that they stand thus disengaged; it\r\nis that they have a fatalistic belief in this higher power. Whatever\r\ntroubles and abuses may arise they have an absolute faith that \"in the\r\nlast analysis\" the People will get it right.\r\n\r\nAnd now suppose that I am right and that there is no People! Suppose\r\nthat the crowd is really no more than a crowd, a vast miscellaneous\r\nconfusion of persons which grows more miscellaneous every year. Suppose\r\nthis conception of the People arose out of a sentimental idealisation,\r\nRousseau fashion, of the ancient homogeneous peasant class--a class that\r\nis rapidly being swept out of existence by modern industrial\r\ndevelopments--and that whatever slender basis of fact it had in the\r\npast is now altogether gone. What consequences may be expected?\r\n\r\nIt does not follow that because the object of your reverence is a dead\r\nword you will get no oracles from the shrine. If the sacred People\r\nremains impassive, inarticulate, non-existent, there are always the\r\nkeepers of the shrine who will oblige. Professional politicians, venal\r\nand violent men, will take over the derelict political control, people\r\nwho live by the book trade will alone have a care for letters, research\r\nand learning will be subordinated to political expediency, and a great\r\ndevelopment of noisily competitive religious enterprises will take the\r\nplace of any common religious formula. There will commence a secular\r\ndecline in the quality of public thought, emotion and activity. There\r\nwill be no arrest or remedy for this state of affairs so long as that\r\nsuperstitious faith in the People as inevitably right \"in the last\r\nanalysis\" remains. And if my supposition is correct, it should be\r\npossible to find in the United States, where faith in the people is\r\nindisputably dominant, some such evidence of the error of this faith. Is\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nI write as one that listens from afar. But there come reports of\r\nlegislative and administrative corruption, of organised public\r\nblackmail, that do seem to carry out my thesis. One thinks of Edgar\r\nAllan Poe, who dreamt of founding a distinctive American literature,\r\ndrugged and killed almost as it were symbolically, amid electioneering\r\nand nearly lied out of all posthumous respect by that scoundrel\r\nGriswold; one thinks of State Universities that are no more than mints\r\nfor bogus degrees; one thinks of \"Science\" Christianity and Zion City.\r\nThese things are quite insufficient for a Q.E.D., but I submit they\r\nfavour my proposition.\r\n\r\nSuppose there is no People at all, but only enormous, differentiating\r\nmillions of men. All sorts of widely accepted generalisations will\r\ncollapse if that foundation is withdrawn. I submit it as worth\r\nconsidering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISEASE OF PARLIAMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1\r\n\r\nThere is a growing discord between governments and governed in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThere has always been discord between governments and governed since\r\nStates began; government has always been to some extent imposed, and\r\nobedience to some extent reluctant. We have come to regard it as a\r\nmatter of course that under all absolutions and narrow oligarchies the\r\ncommunity, so soon as it became educated and as its social elaboration\r\ndeveloped a free class with private initiatives, so soon, indeed, as it\r\nattained to any power of thought and expression at all, would express\r\ndiscontent. But we English and Americans and Western Europeans generally\r\nhad supposed that, so far as our own communities were concerned, this\r\ndiscontent was already anticipated and met by representative\r\ninstitutions. We had supposed that, with various safeguards and\r\nelaborations, our communities did, as a matter of fact, govern\r\nthemselves. Our panacea for all discontents was the franchise. Social\r\nand national dissatisfaction could be given at the same time a voice and\r\na remedy in the ballot box. Our liberal intelligences could and do still\r\nunderstand Russians wanting votes, Indians wanting votes, women wanting\r\nvotes. The history of nineteenth-century Liberalism in the world might\r\nalmost be summed up in the phrase \"progressive enfranchisement.\" But\r\nthese are the desires of a closing phase in political history. The new\r\ndiscords go deeper than that. The new situation which confronts our\r\nLiberal intelligence is the discontent of the enfranchised, the contempt\r\nand hostility of the voters for their elected delegates and governments.\r\n\r\nThis discontent, this resentment, this contempt even, and hostility to\r\nduly elected representatives is no mere accident of this democratic\r\ncountry or that; it is an almost world-wide movement. It is an almost\r\nuniversal disappointment with so-called popular government, and in many\r\ncommunities--in Great Britain particularly--it is manifesting itself by\r\nan unprecedented lawlessness in political matters, and in a strange and\r\nominous contempt for the law. One sees it, for example, in the refusal\r\nof large sections of the medical profession to carry out insurance\r\nlegislation, in the repudiation of Irish Home Rule by Ulster, and in the\r\nsteady drift of great masses of industrial workers towards the\r\nconception of a universal strike. The case of the discontented workers\r\nin Great Britain and France is particularly remarkable. These people\r\nform effective voting majorities in many constituencies; they send\r\nalleged Socialist and Labour representatives into the legislative\r\nassembly; and, in addition, they have their trade unions with staffs of\r\nelected officials, elected ostensibly to state their case and promote\r\ntheir interests. Yet nothing is now more evident than that these\r\nofficials, working-men representatives and the like, do not speak for\r\ntheir supporters, and are less and less able to control them. The\r\nSyndicalist movement, sabotage in France, and Larkinism in Great\r\nBritain, are, from the point of view of social stability, the most\r\nsinister demonstrations of the gathering anger of the labouring classes\r\nwith representative institutions. These movements are not revolutionary\r\nmovements, not movements for reconstruction such as were the democratic\r\nSocialist movements that closed the nineteenth century. They are angry\r\nand vindictive movements. They have behind them the most dangerous and\r\nterrible of purely human forces, the wrath, the blind destructive wrath,\r\nof a cheated crowd.\r\n\r\nNow, so far as the insurrection of labour goes, American conditions\r\ndiffer from European, and the process of disillusionment will probably\r\nfollow a different course. American labour is very largely immigrant\r\nlabour still separated by barriers of language and tradition from the\r\nestablished thought of the nation. It will be long before labour in\r\nAmerica speaks with the massed effectiveness of labour in France and\r\nEngland, where master and man are racially identical, and where there is\r\nno variety of \"Dagoes\" to break up the revolt. But in other directions\r\nthe American disbelief in and impatience with \"elected persons\" is and\r\nhas been far profounder than it is in Europe. The abstinence of men of\r\nproperty and position from overt politics, and the contempt that\r\nbanishes political discussion from polite society, are among the first\r\nsurprises of the visiting European to America, and now that, under an\r\norganised pressure of conscience, college-trained men and men of wealth\r\nare abandoning this strike of the educated and returning to political\r\nlife, it is, one notes, with a prevailing disposition to correct\r\ndemocracy by personality, and to place affairs in the hands of\r\nautocratic mayors and presidents rather than to carry out democratic\r\nmethods to the logical end. At times America seems hot for a Caesar. If\r\nno Caesar is established, then it will be the good fortune of the\r\nRepublic rather than its democratic virtue which will have saved it.\r\n\r\nAnd directly one comes to look into the quality and composition of the\r\nelected governing body of any modern democratic State, one begins to see\r\nthe reason and nature of its widening estrangement from the community it\r\nrepresents. In no sense are these bodies really representative of the\r\nthought and purpose of the nation; the conception of its science, the\r\nfresh initiatives of its philosophy and literature, the forces that make\r\nthe future through invention and experiment, exploration and trial and\r\nindustrial development have no voice, or only an accidental and feeble\r\nvoice, there. The typical elected person is a smart rather than\r\nsubstantial lawyer, full of cheap catchwords and elaborate tricks of\r\nprocedure and electioneering, professing to serve the interests of the\r\nlocality which is his constituency, but actually bound hand and foot to\r\nthe specialised political association, his party, which imposed him upon\r\nthat constituency. Arrived at the legislature, his next ambition is\r\noffice, and to secure and retain office he engages in elaborate\r\nmanoeuvres against the opposite party, upon issues which his limited and\r\nspecialised intelligence indicates as electorally effective. But being\r\nlimited and specialised, he is apt to drift completely out of touch with\r\nthe interests and feelings of large masses of people in the community.\r\nIn Great Britain, the United States and France alike there is a constant\r\ntendency on the part of the legislative body to drift into unreality,\r\nand to bore the country with the disputes that are designed to thrill\r\nit. In Great Britain, for example, at the present time the two political\r\nparties are both profoundly unpopular with the general intelligence,\r\nwhich is sincerely anxious, if only it could find a way, to get rid of\r\nboth of them. Irish Home Rule--an issue as dead as mutton, is opposed to\r\nTariff Reform, which has never been alive. Much as the majority of\r\npeople detest the preposterously clumsy attempts to amputate Ireland\r\nfrom the rule of the British Parliament which have been going on since\r\nthe breakdown of Mr. Gladstone's political intelligence, their dread of\r\nfoolish and scoundrelly fiscal adventurers is sufficiently strong to\r\nretain the Liberals in office. The recent exposures of the profound\r\nfinancial rottenness of the Liberal party have deepened the public\r\nresolve to permit no such enlarged possibilities of corruption as Tariff\r\nReform would afford their at least equally dubitable opponents. And\r\nmeanwhile, beneath those ridiculous alternatives, those sham issues, the\r\nreal and very urgent affairs of the nation, the vast gathering\r\ndiscontent of the workers throughout the Empire, the racial conflicts in\r\nIndia and South Africa which will, if they are not arrested, end in our\r\nseverance from India, the insane waste of national resources, the\r\ncontrol of disease, the frightful need of some cessation of armament,\r\ndrift neglected....\r\n\r\nNow do these things indicate the ultimate failure and downfall of\r\nrepresentative government? Was this idea which inspired so much of the\r\nfinest and most generous thought of the eighteenth and nineteenth\r\ncenturies a wrong idea, and must we go back to Caesarism or oligarchy or\r\nplutocracy or a theocracy, to Rome or Venice or Carthage, to the strong\r\nman or the ruler by divine right, for the political organisation of the\r\nfuture?\r\n\r\nMy answer to that question would be an emphatic No. My answer would be\r\nthat the idea of representative government is the only possible idea for\r\nthe government of a civilised community. But I would add that so far\r\nrepresentative government has not had even the beginnings of a fair\r\ntrial. So far we have not had representative government, but only a\r\ndevastating caricature.\r\n\r\nIt is quite plain now that those who first organised the parliamentary\r\ninstitutions which now are the ruling institutions of the greater part\r\nof mankind fell a prey to certain now very obvious errors. They did not\r\nrealise that there are hundreds of different ways in which voting may be\r\ndone, and that every way will give a different result. They thought, and\r\nit is still thought by a great number of mentally indolent people, that\r\nif a country is divided up into approximately equivalent areas, each\r\nreturning one or two representatives, if every citizen is given one\r\nvote, and if there is no legal limit to the presentation of candidates,\r\nthat presently a cluster of the wisest, most trusted and best citizens\r\nwill come together in the legislative assembly.\r\n\r\nIn reality the business is far more complicated than this. In reality a\r\ncountry will elect all sorts of different people according to the\r\nelectoral method employed. It is a fact that anyone who chooses to\r\nexperiment with a willing school or club may verify. Suppose, for\r\nexample, that you take your country, give every voter one single vote,\r\nput up six and twenty candidates for a dozen vacancies, and give them no\r\nadequate time for organisation. The voters, you will find, will return\r\ncertain favourites, A and B and C and D let us call them, by enormous\r\nmajorities, and behind these at a considerable distance will come E, F,\r\nG, H, I, J, K, and L. Now give your candidates time to develop\r\norganisation. A lot of people who swelled A's huge vote will dislike J\r\nand K and L so much, and prefer M and N so much, that if they are\r\nassured that by proper organisation A's return can be made certain\r\nwithout their voting for him, they will vote for M and N. But they will\r\ndo so only on that understanding. Similarly certain B-ites will want O\r\nand P if they can be got without sacrificing B. So that adequate party\r\norganisation in the community may return not the dozen a naive vote\r\nwould give, but A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, M, N, O, P. Now suppose that,\r\ninstead of this arrangement, your community is divided into twelve\r\nconstituencies and no candidate may contest more than one of them. And\r\nsuppose each constituency has strong local preferences. A, B and C are\r\nwidely popular; in every constituency they have supporters but in no\r\nconstituency does any one of the three command a majority. They are\r\ngreat men, not local men. Q, who is an unknown man in most of the\r\ncountry, has, on the contrary, a strong sect of followers in the\r\nconstituency for which A stands, and beats him by one vote; another\r\nlocal celebrity, E, disposes of B in the same way; C is attacked not\r\nonly by S but T, whose peculiar views upon vaccination, let us say,\r\nappeal to just enough of C's supporters to let in S. Similar accidents\r\nhappen in the other constituencies, and the country that would have\r\nunreservedly returned A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K and L on the first\r\nsystem, return instead O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Numerous\r\nvoters who would have voted for A if they had a chance vote instead for\r\nR, S, T, etc., numbers who would have voted for B, vote for Q, V, W, X,\r\netc. But now suppose that A and B are opposed to one another, and that\r\nthere is a strong A party and a strong B party highly organised in the\r\ncountry. B is really the second favourite over the country as a whole,\r\nbut A is the first favourite. D, F, H, J, L, N, P, R, U, W, Y constitute\r\nthe A candidates and in his name they conquer. B, C, E, G, I, K, M, O,\r\nQ, S, V are all thrown out in spite of the wide popularity of B and C. B\r\nand C, we have supposed, are the second and third favourites, and yet\r\nthey go out in favour of Y, of whom nobody has heard before, some mere\r\nhangers-on of A's. Such a situation actually occurs in both Ulster and\r\nHome-Rule Ireland.\r\n\r\nBut now let us suppose another arrangement, and that is that the whole\r\ncountry is one constituency, and every voter has, if he chooses to\r\nexercise them, twelve votes, which, however, he must give, if he gives\r\nthem all, to twelve separate people. Then quite certainly A, B, C, D\r\nwill come in, but the tail will be different. M, N, O, P may come up\r\nnext to them, and even Z, that eminent non-party man, may get in. But\r\nnow organisation may produce new effects. The ordinary man, when he has\r\ntwelve votes to give, likes to give them all, so that there will be a\r\ngood deal of wild voting at the tails of the voting papers. Now if a\r\nsmall resolute band decide to plump for T or to vote only for A and T or\r\nB and T, T will probably jump up out of the rejected. This is the system\r\nwhich gives the specialist, the anti-vaccinator or what not, the maximum\r\nadvantage. V, W, X and Y, being rather hopeless anyhow, will probably\r\ndetach themselves from party and make some special appeal, say to the\r\nteetotal vote or the Mormon vote or the single tax vote, and so squeeze\r\npast O, P, Q, R, who have taken a more generalised line.\r\n\r\nI trust the reader will bear with me through these alphabetical\r\nfluctuations. Many people, I know from colloquial experiences, do at\r\nabout this stage fly into a passion. But if you will exercise\r\nself-control, then I think you will see my point that, according to the\r\nmethod of voting, almost any sort of result may be got out of an\r\nelection except the production of a genuinely representative assembly.\r\n\r\nAnd that is the a priori case for supposing, what our experience of\r\ncontemporary life abundantly verifies, that the so-called representative\r\nassemblies of the world are not really representative at all. I will go\r\nfarther and say that were it not for the entire inefficiency of our\r\nmethod of voting, not one-tenth of the present American and French\r\nSenators, the French Deputies, the American Congressmen, and the English\r\nMembers of Parliament would hold their positions to-day. They would\r\nnever have been heard of. They are not really the elected\r\nrepresentatives of the people; they are the products of a ridiculous\r\nmethod of election; they are the illegitimate children of the party\r\nsystem and the ballot-box, who have ousted the legitimate heirs from\r\ntheir sovereignty. They are no more the expression of the general will\r\nthan the Tsar or some President by _pronunciamento_. They are an\r\naccidental oligarchy of adventurers. Representative government has never\r\nyet existed in the world; there was an attempt to bring it into\r\nexistence in the eighteenth century, and it succumbed to an infantile\r\ndisorder at the very moment of its birth. What we have in the place of\r\nthe leaders and representatives are politicians and \"elected persons.\"\r\n\r\nThe world is passing rapidly from localised to generalised interests,\r\nbut the method of election into which our fathers fell is the method of\r\nelecting one or two representatives from strictly localised\r\nconstituencies. Its immediate corruption was inevitable. If discussing\r\nand calculating the future had been, as it ought to be, a common,\r\nsystematic occupation, the muddles of to-day might have been foretold a\r\nhundred years ago. From such a rough method of election the party system\r\nfollowed as a matter of course. In theory, of course, there may be any\r\nnumber of candidates for a constituency and a voter votes for the one he\r\nlikes best; in practice there are only two or three candidates, and the\r\nvoter votes for the one most likely to beat the candidate he likes\r\nleast. It cannot be too strongly insisted that in contemporary elections\r\nwe vote against; we do not vote for. If A, B and C are candidates, and\r\nyou hate C and all his works and prefer A, but doubt if he will get as\r\nmany votes as B, who is indifferent to you, the chances are you will\r\nvote for B. If C and B have the support of organised parties, you are\r\nstill less likely to risk \"wasting\" your vote upon A. If your real\r\nconfidence is in G, who is not a candidate for your constituency, and if\r\nB pledges himself to support G, while A retains the right of separate\r\naction, you may vote for B even if you distrust him personally.\r\nAdditional candidates would turn any election of this type into a wild\r\nscramble. The system lies, in fact, wholly open to the control of\r\npolitical organisations, calls out, indeed, for the control of political\r\norganisations, and has in every country produced what is so evidently\r\ndemanded. The political organisations to-day rule us unchallenged. Save\r\nas they speak for us, the people are dumb.\r\n\r\nElections of the prevalent pattern, which were intended and are still\r\nsupposed by simple-minded people to give every voter participation in\r\ngovernment, do as a matter of fact effect nothing of the sort. They give\r\nhim an exasperating fragment of choice between the agents of two party\r\norganisations, over neither of which he has any intelligible control.\r\nFor twenty-five years I have been a voter, and in all that time I have\r\nonly twice had an opportunity of voting for a man of distinction in whom\r\nI had the slightest confidence. Commonly my choice of a \"representative\"\r\nhas been between a couple of barristers entirely unknown to me or the\r\nworld at large. Rather more than half the men presented for my selection\r\nhave not been English at all, but of alien descent. This, then, is the\r\nsum of the political liberty of the ordinary American or Englishman,\r\nthat is the political emancipation which Englishwomen have shown\r\nthemselves so pathetically eager to share. He may reject one of two\r\nundesirables, and the other becomes his \"representative.\" Now this is\r\nnot popular government at all; it is government by the profession of\r\npoliticians, whose control becomes more and more irresponsible in just\r\nthe measure that they are able to avoid real factions within their own\r\nbody. Whatever the two party organisations have a mind to do together,\r\nwhatever issue they chance to reserve from \"party politics,\" is as much\r\nbeyond the control of the free and independent voter as if he were a\r\nslave subject in ancient Peru.\r\n\r\nOur governments in the more civilised parts of the world to-day are only\r\nin theory and sentiment democratic. In reality they are democracies so\r\neviscerated by the disease of bad electoral methods that they are mere\r\ncloaks for the parasitic oligarchies that have grown up within their\r\nform and substance. The old spirit of freedom and the collective purpose\r\nwhich overthrew and subdued priestcrafts and kingcrafts, has done so, it\r\nseems, only to make way for these obscure political conspiracies.\r\nInstead of liberal institutions, mankind has invented a new sort of\r\nusurpation. And it is not unnatural that many of us should be in a phase\r\nof political despair.\r\n\r\nThese oligarchies of the party organisations have now been evolving for\r\ntwo centuries, and their inherent evils and dangers become more and more\r\nmanifest. The first of these is the exclusion from government of the\r\nmore active and intelligent sections of the community. It is not treated\r\nas remarkable, it is treated as a matter of course, that neither in\r\nCongress nor in the House of Commons is there any adequate\r\nrepresentation of the real thought of the time, of its science,\r\ninvention and enterprise, of its art and feeling, of its religion and\r\npurpose. When one speaks of Congressmen or Members of Parliament one\r\nthinks, to be plain about it, of intellectual riff-raff. When one hears\r\nof a pre-eminent man in the English-speaking community, even though that\r\npre-eminence may be in political or social science, one is struck by a\r\nsense of incongruity if he happens to be also in the Legislature. When\r\nLord Haldane disengages the Gifford lectures or Lord Morley writes a\r\n\"Life of Gladstone\" or ex-President Roosevelt is delivered of a magazine\r\narticle, there is the same sort of excessive admiration as when a Royal\r\nPrincess does a water-colour sketch or a dog walks on its hind legs.\r\n\r\nNow this intellectual inferiority of the legislator is not only directly\r\nbad for the community by producing dull and stupid legislation, but it\r\nhas a discouraging and dwarfing effect upon our intellectual life.\r\nNothing so stimulates art, thought and science as realisation; nothing\r\nso cripples it as unreality. But to set oneself to know thoroughly and\r\nto think clearly about any human question is to unfit oneself for the\r\nforensic claptrap which is contemporary politics, is to put oneself out\r\nof the effective current of the nation's life. The intelligence of any\r\ncommunity which does not make a collective use of that intelligence,\r\nstarves and becomes hectic, tends inevitably to preciousness and\r\nfutility on the one hand, and to insurgency, mischief and anarchism on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of social stability this estrangement of the\r\nnational government and the national intelligence is far less serious\r\nthan the estrangement between the governing body and the real feeling of\r\nthe mass of the people. To many observers this latter estrangement seems\r\nto be drifting very rapidly towards a social explosion in the British\r\nIsles. The organised masses of labour find themselves baffled both by\r\ntheir parliamentary representatives and by their trade union officials.\r\nThey are losing faith in their votes and falling back in anger upon\r\ninsurrectionary ideals, upon the idea of a general strike, and upon the\r\nexpedients of sabotage. They are doing this without any constructive\r\nproposals at all, for it is ridiculous to consider Syndicalism as a\r\nconstructive proposal. They mean mischief because they are hopeless and\r\nbitterly disappointed. It is the same thing in France, and before many\r\nyears are over it will be the same thing in America. That way lies\r\nchaos. In the next few years there may be social revolt and bloodshed in\r\nmost of the great cities of Western Europe. That is the trend of current\r\nprobability. Yet the politicians go on in an almost complete disregard\r\nof this gathering storm. Their jerrymandered electoral methods are like\r\nwool in their ears, and the rejection of Tweedledum for Tweedledee is\r\ntaken as a \"mandate\" for Tweedledee's distinctive brand of political\r\nunrealities....\r\n\r\nIs this an incurable state of things? Is this method of managing our\r\naffairs the only possible electoral method, and is there no remedy for\r\nits monstrous clumsiness and inefficiency but to \"show a sense of\r\nhumour,\" or, in other words, to grin and bear it? Or is it conceivable\r\nthat there may be a better way to government than any we have yet tried,\r\na method of government that would draw every class into conscious and\r\nwilling co-operation with the State, and enable every activity of the\r\ncommunity to play its proper part in the national life? That was the\r\ndream of those who gave the world representative government in the past.\r\nWas it an impossible dream?\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2\r\n\r\nIs this disease of Parliaments an incurable disease, and have we,\r\ntherefore, to get along as well as we can with it, just as a tainted and\r\nincurable invalid diets and is careful and gets along through life? Or\r\nis it possible that some entirely more representative and effective\r\ncollective control of our common affairs can be devised?\r\n\r\nThe answer to that must determine our attitude to a great number of\r\nfundamental questions. If no better governing body is possible than the\r\nstupid, dilatory and forensic assemblies that rule in France, Britain\r\nand America to-day, then the civilised human community has reached its\r\nclimax. That more comprehensive collective handling of the common\r\ninterests to which science and intelligent Socialism point, that\r\ncollective handling which is already urgently needed if the present\r\nuncontrolled waste of natural resources and the ultimate bankruptcy of\r\nmankind is to be avoided, is quite beyond the capacity of such\r\nassemblies; already there is too much in their clumsy and untrustworthy\r\nhands, and the only course open to us is an attempt at enlightened\r\nIndividualism, an attempt to limit and restrict State activities in\r\nevery possible way, and to make little private temporary islands of\r\nlight and refinement amidst the general disorder and decay. All\r\ncollectivist schemes, all rational Socialism, if only Socialists would\r\nrealise it, all hope for humanity, indeed, are dependent ultimately upon\r\nthe hypothetical possibility of a better system of government than any\r\nat present in existence.\r\n\r\nLet us see first, then, if we can lay down any conditions which such a\r\nbetter governing body would satisfy. Afterwards it will be open to us to\r\nbelieve or disbelieve in its attainment. Imagination is the essence of\r\ncreation. If we can imagine a better government we are half-way to\r\nmaking it.\r\n\r\nNow, whatever other conditions such a body will satisfy, we may be sure\r\nthat it will not be made up of members elected by single-member\r\nconstituencies. A single-member constituency must necessarily contain a\r\nminority, and may even contain a majority of dissatisfied persons whose\r\nrepresentation is, as it were, blotted out by the successful candidate.\r\nThree single-member constituencies which might all return members of the\r\nsame colour, if they were lumped together to return three members would\r\nprobably return two of one colour and one of another. There would still,\r\nhowever, be a suppressed minority averse to both these colours, or\r\ndesiring different shades of those colours from those afforded them in\r\nthe constituency. Other things being equal, it may be laid down that the\r\nlarger the constituency and the more numerous its representatives, the\r\ngreater the chance of all varieties of thought and opinion being\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nBut that is only a preliminary statement; it still leaves untouched all\r\nthe considerations advanced in the former part of this discussion to\r\nshow how easily the complications and difficulties of voting lead to a\r\nfalsification of the popular will and understanding. But here we enter a\r\nregion where a really scientific investigation has been made, and where\r\nestablished results are available. A method of election was worked out\r\nby Hare in the middle of the last century that really does seem to avoid\r\nor mitigate nearly every falsifying or debilitating possibility in\r\nelections; it was enthusiastically supported by J.S. Mill; it is now\r\nadvocated by a special society--the Proportional Representation\r\nSociety--to which belong men of the most diverse type of distinction,\r\nunited only by the common desire to see representative government a\r\nreality and not a disastrous sham. It is a method which does render\r\nimpossible nearly every way of forcing candidates upon constituencies,\r\nand nearly every trick for rigging results that now distorts and\r\ncripples the political life of the modern world. It exacts only one\r\ncondition, a difficult but not an impossible condition, and that is the\r\nhonest scrutiny and counting of the votes.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar invention of the system is what is called the single\r\ntransferable vote--that is to say, a vote which may be given in the\r\nfirst instance to one candidate, but which, in the event of his already\r\nhaving a sufficient quota of votes to return him, may be transferred to\r\nanother. The voter marks clearly in the list of the candidates the order\r\nof his preference by placing 1, 2, 3, and so forth against the names. In\r\nthe subsequent counting the voting papers are first classified according\r\nto the first votes. Let us suppose that popular person A is found to\r\nhave received first votes enormously in excess of what is needed to\r\nreturn him. The second votes are then counted on his papers, and after\r\nthe number of votes necessary to return him has been deducted, the\r\nsurplus votes are divided in due proportion among the second choice\r\nnames, and count for them. That is the essential idea of the whole\r\nthing. At a stroke all that anxiety about wasting votes and splitting\r\nvotes, _which is the secret of all party political manipulation_\r\nvanishes. You may vote for A well knowing that if he is safe your vote\r\nwill be good for C. You can make sure of A, and at the same time vote\r\nfor C. You are in no need of a \"ticket\" to guide you, and you need have\r\nno fear that in supporting an independent candidate you will destroy the\r\nprospects of some tolerably sympathetic party man without any\r\ncompensating advantage. The independent candidate does, in fact, become\r\npossible for the first time. The Hobson's choice of the party machine is\r\nabolished.\r\n\r\nLet me be a little more precise about the particulars of this method,\r\nthe only sound method, of voting in order to ensure an adequate\r\nrepresentation of the community. Let us resort again to the constituency\r\nI imagined in my last paper, a constituency in which candidates\r\nrepresented by all the letters of the alphabet struggle for twelve\r\nplaces. And let us suppose that A, B, C and D are the leading\r\nfavourites. Suppose that there are twelve thousand voters in the\r\nconstituency, and that three thousand votes are cast for A--I am keeping\r\nthe figures as simple as possible--then A has two thousand more than is\r\nneeded to return him. _All_ the second votes on his papers are counted,\r\nand it is found that 600, or a fifth of them, go to C; 500, or a sixth,\r\ngo to E; 300, or a tenth, to G; 300 to J; 200, or a fifteenth, each to K\r\nand L, and a hundred each, or a thirtieth, to M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, W\r\nand Z. Then the surplus of 2,000 is divided in these proportions--that\r\nis a fifth of 2,000 goes to C, a sixth to E, and the rest to G, J, etc.,\r\nin proportion. C, who already has 900 votes, gets another 400, and is\r\nnow returned and has, moreover, 300 to spare; and the same division of\r\nthe next votes upon C's paper occurs as has already been made with A's.\r\nBut previously to this there has been a distribution of B's surplus\r\nvotes, B having got 1,200 of first votes. And so on. After the\r\ndistribution of the surplus votes of the elect at the top of the list,\r\nthere is a distribution of the second votes upon the papers of those who\r\nhave voted for the hopeless candidates at the bottom of the list. At\r\nlast a point is reached when twelve candidates have a quota.\r\n\r\nIn this way the \"wasting\" of a vote, or the rejection of a candidate for\r\nany reason except that hardly anybody wants him, become practically\r\nimpossible. This method of the single transferable vote with very large\r\nconstituencies and many members does, in fact, give an entirely valid\r\nelectoral result; each vote tells for all it is worth, and the freedom\r\nof the voter is only limited by the number of candidates who put up or\r\nare put up for election. This method, and this method alone, gives\r\nrepresentative government; all others of the hundred and one possible\r\nmethods admit of trickery, confusion and falsification. Proportional\r\nRepresentation is not a faddist proposal, not a perplexing ingenious\r\ncomplication of a simple business; it is the carefully worked out right\r\nway to do something that hitherto we have been doing in the wrong way.\r\nIt is no more an eccentricity than is proper baking in the place of\r\nbaking amidst dirt and with unlimited adulteration, or the running of\r\ntrains to their destinations instead of running them without notice into\r\ncasually selected sidings and branch lines. It is not the substitution\r\nof something for something else of the same nature; it is the\r\nsubstitution of right for wrong. It is the plain common sense of the\r\ngreatest difficulty in contemporary affairs.\r\n\r\nI know that a number of people do not, will not, admit this of\r\nProportional Representation. Perhaps it is because of that hideous\r\nmouthful of words for a thing that would be far more properly named Sane\r\nVoting. This, which is the only correct way, these antagonists regard as\r\na peculiar way. It has unfamiliar features, and that condemns it in\r\ntheir eyes. It takes at least ten minutes to understand, and that is too\r\nmuch for their plain, straightforward souls. \"Complicated\"--that word of\r\nfear! They are like the man who approved of an electric tram, but said\r\nthat he thought it would go better without all that jiggery-pokery of\r\nwires up above. They are like the Western judge in the murder trial who\r\nsaid that if only they got a man hanged for this abominable crime, he\r\nwouldn't make a pedantic fuss about the question of _which_ man. They\r\nare like the plain, straightforward promoter who became impatient with\r\nmaps and planned a railway across Switzerland by drawing a straight line\r\nwith a ruler across Jungfrau and Matterhorn and glacier and gorge. Or\r\nelse they are like Mr. J. Ramsay Macdonald, M.P., who knows too well\r\nwhat would happen to him.\r\n\r\nNow let us consider what would be the necessary consequences of the\r\nestablishment of Proportional Representation in such a community as\r\nGreat Britain--that is to say, the redistribution of the country into\r\ngreat constituencies such as London or Ulster or Wessex or South Wales,\r\neach returning a score or more of members, and the establishment of\r\nvoting by the single transferable vote. The first, immediate, most\r\ndesirable result would be the disappearance of the undistinguished party\r\ncandidate; he would vanish altogether. He would be no more seen.\r\nProportional Representation would not give him the ghost of a chance.\r\nThe very young man of good family, the subsidised barrister, the\r\nrespectable nobody, the rich supporter of the party would be ousted by\r\nknown men. No candidate who had not already distinguished himself, and\r\nwho did not stand for something in the public eye, would have a chance\r\nof election. There alone we have a sufficient reason for anticipating a\r\nvery thorough change in the quality and character of the average\r\nlegislator.\r\n\r\nAnd next, no party organisation, no intimation from headquarters, no\r\ndirty tricks behind the scenes, no conspiracy of spite and scandal would\r\nhave much chance of keeping out any man of real force and distinction\r\nwho had impressed the public imagination. To be famous in science, to\r\nhave led thought, to have explored or administered or dissented\r\ncourageously from the schemes of official wire-pullers would no longer\r\nbe a bar to a man's attainment of Parliament. It would be a help. Not\r\nonly the level of parliamentary intelligence, but the level of personal\r\nindependence would be raised far above its present position. And\r\nParliament would become a gathering of prominent men instead of a means\r\nto prominence.\r\n\r\nThe two-party system which holds all the English-speaking countries\r\nto-day in its grip would certainly be broken up by Proportional\r\nRepresentation. Sane Voting in the end would kill the Liberal and Tory\r\nand Democratic and Republican party-machines. That secret rottenness of\r\nour public life, that hidden conclave which sells honours, fouls\r\nfinance, muddles public affairs, fools the passionate desires of the\r\npeople, and ruins honest men by obscure campaigns would become\r\nimpossible. The advantage of party support would be a doubtful\r\nadvantage, and in Parliament itself the party men would find themselves\r\noutclassed and possibly even outnumbered by the independent. It would be\r\nonly a matter of a few years between the adoption of Sane Voting and the\r\ndisappearance of the Cabinet from British public life. It would become\r\npossible for Parliament to get rid of a minister without getting rid of\r\na ministry, and to express its disapproval of--let us say--some foolish\r\nproject for rearranging the local government of Ireland without opening\r\nthe door upon a vista of fantastical fiscal adventures. The\r\nparty-supported Cabinet, which is now the real government of the\r\nso-called democratic countries, would cease to be so, and government\r\nwould revert more and more to the legislative assembly. And not only\r\nwould the latter body resume government, but it would also necessarily\r\ntake into itself all those large and growing exponents of\r\nextra-parliamentary discontent that now darken the social future. The\r\ncase of the armed \"Unionist\" rebel in Ulster, the case of the workman\r\nwho engages in sabotage, the case for sympathetic strikes and the\r\ngeneral strike, all these cases are identical in this, that they declare\r\nParliament a fraud, that justice lies outside it and hopelessly outside\r\nit, and that to seek redress through Parliament is a waste of time and\r\nenergy. Sane Voting would deprive all these destructive movements of the\r\nexcuse and necessity for violence.\r\n\r\nThere is, I know, a disposition in some quarters to minimise the\r\nimportance of Proportional Representation, as though it were a mere\r\nreadjustment of voting methods. It is nothing of the sort; it is a\r\nprospective revolution. It will revolutionise government far more than a\r\nmere change from kingdom to republic or vice versa could possibly do; it\r\nwill give a new and unprecedented sort of government to the world. The\r\nreal leaders of the country will govern the country. For Great Britain,\r\nfor example, instead of the secret, dubious and dubitable Cabinet, which\r\nis the real British government of to-day, poised on an unwieldy and\r\ncrowded House of Commons, we should have open government by the\r\nrepresentatives of, let us say, twenty great provinces, Ulster, Wales,\r\nLondon, for example, each returning from twelve to thirty members. It\r\nwould be a steadier, stabler, more confident, and more trusted\r\ngovernment than the world has ever seen before. Ministers, indeed, and\r\neven ministries might come and go, but that would not matter, as it does\r\nnow, because there would be endless alternatives through which the\r\nassembly could express itself instead of the choice between two parties.\r\n\r\nThe arguments against Proportional Representation that have been\r\nadvanced hitherto are trivial in comparison with its enormous\r\nadvantages. Implicit in them all is the supposition that public opinion\r\nis at bottom a foolish thing, and that electoral methods are to pacify\r\nrather than express a people. It is possibly true that notorious\r\nwindbags, conspicuously advertised adventurers, and the heroes of\r\ntemporary sensations may run a considerable chance upon the lists. My\r\nown estimate of the popular wisdom is against the idea that any vividly\r\nprominent figure must needs get in; I think the public is capable of\r\nappreciating, let us say, the charm and interest of Mr. Sandow or Mr.\r\nJack Johnson or Mr. Harry Lauder or Mr. Evan Roberts without wanting to\r\nsend these gentlemen into Parliament. And I think that the increased\r\npower that the Press would have through its facilities in making\r\nreputations may also be exaggerated. Reputations are mysterious things\r\nand not so easily forced, and even if it were possible for a section of\r\nthe Press to limelight a dozen or so figures up to the legislature, they\r\nwould still have, I think, to be interesting, sympathetic and\r\nindividualised figures; and at the end they would be only half a dozen\r\namong four hundred men of a repute more naturally achieved. A third\r\nobjection is that this reform would give us group politics and unstable\r\ngovernment. It might very possibly give us unstable ministries, but\r\nunstable ministries may mean stable government, and such stable\r\nministries as that which governs England at the present time may, by\r\nclinging obstinately to office, mean the wildest fluctuations of policy.\r\nMr. Ramsay Macdonald has drawn a picture of the too-representative\r\nParliament of Proportional Representation, split up into groups each\r\npledged to specific measures and making the most extraordinary treaties\r\nand sacrifices of the public interest in order to secure the passing of\r\nthese definite bills. But Mr. Ramsay Macdonald is exclusively a\r\nparliamentary man; he knows contemporary parliamentary \"shop\" as a clerk\r\nknows his \"guv'nor,\" and he thinks in the terms of his habitual life; he\r\nsees representatives only as politicians financed from party\r\nheadquarters; it is natural that he should fail to see that the quality\r\nand condition of the sanely elected Member of Parliament will be quite\r\ndifferent from these scheming climbers into positions of trust with whom\r\nhe deals to-day. It is the party system based on insane voting that\r\nmakes governments indivisible wholes and gives the group and the cave\r\ntheir terrors and their effectiveness. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald is as\r\ntypical a product of existing electoral methods as one could well have,\r\nand his peculiarly keen sense of the power of intrigue in legislation is\r\nas good evidence as one could wish for of the need for drastic change.\r\n\r\nOf course, Sane Voting is not a short cut to the millennium, it is no\r\nway of changing human nature, and in the new type of assembly, as in the\r\nold, spite, vanity, indolence, self-interest, and downright dishonesty\r\nwill play their part. But to object to a reform on that account is not a\r\nparticularly effective objection. These things will play their part, but\r\nit will be a much smaller part in the new than in the old. It is like\r\nobjecting to some projected and long-needed railway because it does not\r\npropose to carry its passengers by immediate express to heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN POPULATION\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1\r\n\r\nThe social conditions and social future of America constitute a system\r\nof problems quite distinct and separate from the social problems of any\r\nother part of the world. The nearest approach to parallel conditions,\r\nand that on a far smaller and narrower scale, is found in the British\r\ncolonies and in the newly settled parts of Siberia. For while in nearly\r\nevery other part of the world the population of to-day is more or less\r\ncompletely descended from the prehistoric population of the same region,\r\nand has developed its social order in a slow growth extending over many\r\ncenturies, the American population is essentially a transplanted\r\npopulation, a still fluid and imperfect fusion of great fragments torn\r\nat this point or that from the gradually evolved societies of Europe.\r\nThe European social systems grow and flower upon their roots, in soil\r\nwhich has made them and to which they are adapted. The American social\r\naccumulation is a various collection of cuttings thrust into a new soil\r\nand respiring a new air, so different that the question is still open to\r\ndoubt, and indeed there are those who do doubt, how far these cuttings\r\nare actually striking root and living and growing, whether indeed they\r\nare destined to more than a temporary life in the new hemisphere. I\r\npropose to discuss and weigh certain arguments for and against the\r\nbelief that these ninety million people who constitute the United\r\nStates of America are destined to develop into a great distinctive\r\nnation with a character and culture of its own.\r\n\r\nHumanly speaking, the United States of America (and the same is true of\r\nCanada and all the more prosperous, populous and progressive regions of\r\nSouth America) is a vast sea of newly arrived and unstably rooted\r\npeople. Of the seventy-six million inhabitants recorded by the 1900\r\ncensus, ten and a half million were born and brought up in one or other\r\nof the European social systems, and the parents of another twenty-six\r\nmillions were foreigners. Another nine million are of African negro\r\ndescent. Fourteen million of the sixty-five million native-born are\r\nliving not in the state of their birth, but in other states to which\r\nthey have migrated. Of the thirty and a half million whites whose\r\nparents on both sides were native Americans, a high proportion probably\r\nhad one if not more grand-parents foreign-born. Nearly five and a half\r\nmillion out of thirty-three and a half million whites in 1870 were\r\nforeign-born, and another five and a quarter million the children of\r\nforeign-born parents. The children of the latter five and a quarter\r\nmillion count, of course, in the 1900 census as native-born of native\r\nparents. Immigration varies enormously with the activity of business,\r\nbut in 1906 it rose for the first time above a million.\r\n\r\nThese figures may be difficult to grasp. The facts may be seen in a more\r\nconcrete form by the visitor to Ellis Island, the receiving station for\r\nthe immigrants into New York Harbour. One goes to this place by tugs\r\nfrom the United States barge office in Battery Park, and in order to see\r\nthe thing properly one needs a letter of introduction to the\r\ncommissioner in charge. Then one is taken through vast barracks littered\r\nwith people of every European race, every type of low-class European\r\ncostume, and every degree of dirtiness, to a central hall in which the\r\ngist of the examining goes on. The floor of this hall is divided up into\r\na sort of maze of winding passages between lattice work, and along these\r\npassages, day after day, incessantly, the immigrants go, wild-eyed\r\nGipsies, Armenians, Greeks, Italians, Ruthenians, Cossacks, German\r\npeasants, Scandinavians, a few Irish still, impoverished English,\r\noccasional Dutch; they halt for a moment at little desks to exhibit\r\npapers, at other little desks to show their money and prove they are not\r\npaupers, to have their eyes scanned by this doctor and their general\r\nbearing by that. Their thumb-marks are taken, their names and heights\r\nand weights and so forth are recorded for the card index; and so,\r\nslowly, they pass along towards America, and at last reach a little\r\nwicket, the gate of the New World. Through this metal wicket drips the\r\nimmigration stream--all day long, every two or three seconds, an\r\nimmigrant with a valise or a bundle, passes the little desk and goes on\r\npast the well-managed money-changing place, past the carefully organised\r\nseparating ways that go to this railway or that, past the guiding,\r\nprotecting officials--into a new world. The great majority are young men\r\nand young women between seventeen and thirty, good, youthful, hopeful\r\npeasant stock. They stand in a long string, waiting to go through that\r\nwicket, with bundles, with little tin boxes, with cheap portmanteaus\r\nwith odd packages, in pairs, in families, alone, women with children,\r\nmen with strings of dependents, young couples. All day that string of\r\nhuman beads waits there, jerks forward, waits again; all day and every\r\nday, constantly replenished, constantly dropping the end beads through\r\nthe wicket, till the units mount to hundreds and the hundreds to\r\nthousands.... In such a prosperous year as 1906 more immigrants passed\r\nthrough that wicket into America than children were born in the whole of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThis figure of a perpetual stream of new stranger citizens will serve to\r\nmark the primary distinction between the American social problem and\r\nthat of any European or Asiatic community.\r\n\r\nThe vast bulk of the population of the United States has, in fact, only\r\ngot there from Europe in the course of the last hundred years, and\r\nmainly since the accession of Queen Victoria to the throne of Great\r\nBritain. That is the first fact that the student of the American social\r\nfuture must realise. Only an extremely small proportion of its blood\r\ngoes back now to those who fought for freedom in the days of George\r\nWashington. The American community is not an expanded colonial society\r\nthat has become autonomous. It is a great and deepening pool of\r\npopulation accumulating upon the area these predecessors freed, and\r\nsince fed copiously by affluents from every European community. Fresh\r\ningredients are still being added in enormous quantity, in quantity so\r\ngreat as to materially change the racial quality in a score of years. It\r\nis particularly noteworthy that each accession of new blood seems to\r\nsterilise its predecessors. Had there been no immigration at all into\r\nthe United States, but had the rate of increase that prevailed in\r\n1810-20 prevailed to 1900, the population, which would then have been a\r\npurely native American one, would have amounted to a hundred\r\nmillion--that is to say, to approximately nine million in excess of the\r\npresent total population. The new waves are for a time amazingly fecund,\r\nand then comes a rapid fall in the birth-rate. The proportion of\r\ncolonial and early republican blood in the population is, therefore,\r\nprobably far smaller even than the figures I have quoted would suggest.\r\n\r\nThese accesses of new population have come in a series of waves, very\r\nmuch as if successive reservoirs of surplus population in the Old World\r\nhad been tapped, drained and exhausted. First came the Irish and\r\nGermans, then Central Europeans of various types, then Poland and\r\nWestern Russia began to pour out their teeming peoples, and more\r\nparticularly their Jews, Bohemia, the Slavonic states, Italy and Hungary\r\nfollowed and the latest arrivals include great numbers of Levantines,\r\nArmenians and other peoples from Asia Minor and the Balkan Peninsula.\r\nThe Hungarian immigrants have still a birth-rate of forty-six per\r\nthousand, the highest birth-rate in the world.\r\n\r\nA considerable proportion of the Mediterranean arrivals, it has to be\r\nnoted, and more especially the Italians, do not come to settle. They\r\nwork for a season or a few years, and then return to Italy. The rest\r\ncome to stay.\r\n\r\nA vast proportion of these accessions to the American population since\r\n1840 has, with the exception of the East European Jews, consisted of\r\npeasantry, mainly or totally illiterate, accustomed to a low standard of\r\nlife and heavy bodily toil. For most of them the transfer to a new\r\ncountry meant severance from the religious communion in which they had\r\nbeen bred and from the servilities or subordinations to which they were\r\naccustomed They brought little or no positive social tradition to the\r\nsynthesis to which they brought their blood and muscle.\r\n\r\nThe earlier German, English and Scandinavian incomers were drawn from a\r\nsomewhat higher social level, and were much more closely akin in habits\r\nand faith to the earlier founders of the Republic.\r\n\r\nOur inquiry is this: What social structure is this pool of mixed\r\nhumanity developing or likely to develop?\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2\r\n\r\nIf we compare any European nation with the American, we perceive at once\r\ncertain broad differences. The former, in comparison with the latter, is\r\nevolved and organised; the latter, in comparison with the former, is\r\naggregated and chaotic. In nearly every European country there is a\r\nsocial system often quite elaborately classed and defined; each class\r\nwith a sense of function, with an idea of what is due to it and what is\r\nexpected of it. Nearly everywhere you find a governing class,\r\naristocratic in spirit, sometimes no doubt highly modified by recent\r\neconomic and industrial changes, with more or less of the tradition of a\r\nfeudal nobility, then a definite great mercantile class, then a large\r\nself-respecting middle class of professional men, minor merchants, and\r\nso forth, then a new industrial class of employees in the manufacturing\r\nand urban districts, and a peasant population rooted to the land. There\r\nare, of course, many local modifications of this form: in France the\r\nnobility is mostly expropriated; in England, since the days of John\r\nBull, the peasant has lost his common rights and his holding, and become\r\nan \"agricultural labourer\" to a newer class of more extensive farmer.\r\nBut these are differences in detail; the fact of the organisation, and\r\nthe still more important fact of the traditional feeling of\r\norganisation, remain true of all these older communities.\r\n\r\nAnd in nearly every European country, though it may be somewhat\r\ndespoiled here and shorn of exclusive predominance there, or represented\r\nby a dislocated \"reformed\" member, is the Church, custodian of a great\r\nmoral tradition, closely associated with the national universities and\r\nthe organisation of national thought. The typical European town has its\r\ncastle or great house, its cathedral or church, its middle-class and\r\nlower-class quarters. Five miles off one can see that the American town\r\nis on an entirely different plan. In his remarkable \"American Scene,\"\r\nMr. Henry James calls attention to the fact that the Church as one sees\r\nit and feels it universally in Europe is altogether absent, and he adds\r\na comment as suggestive as it is vague. Speaking of the appearance of\r\nthe Churches, so far as they do appear amidst American urban scenery, he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  \"Looking for the most part no more established or\r\n  seated than a stopped omnibus, they are reduced to the\r\n  inveterate bourgeois level (that of private, accommodated\r\n  pretensions merely), and fatally despoiled of the fine old\r\n  ecclesiastical arrogance, ... The field of American life is\r\n  as bare of the Church as a billiard-table of a centre-piece; a\r\n  truth that the myriad little structures 'attended' on Sundays\r\n  and on the 'off' evenings of their 'sociables' proclaim as\r\n  with the audible sound of the roaring of a million mice....\r\n\r\n  \"And however one indicates one's impression of the\r\n  clearance, the clearance itself, in its completeness, with the\r\n  innumerable odd connected circumstances that bring it\r\n  home, represents, in the history of manners and morals, a\r\n  deviation in the mere measurement of which hereafter may\r\n  well reside a certain critical thrill. I say hereafter because\r\n  it is a question of one of those many measurements that\r\n  would as yet, in the United States, be premature. Of all\r\n  the solemn conclusions one feels as 'barred,' the list is quite\r\n  headed in the States, I think, by this particular abeyance\r\n  of judgment. When an ancient treasure of precious vessels,\r\n  overscored with glowing gems and wrought artistically into\r\n  wondrous shapes, has, by a prodigious process, been converted\r\n  through a vast community into the small change,\r\n  the simple circulating medium of dollars and 'nickels,' we\r\n  can only say that the consequent permeation will be of\r\n  values of a new order. Of _what_ order we must wait to\r\n  see.\"\r\n\r\nAmerica has no Church. Neither has it a peasantry nor an aristocracy,\r\nand until well on in the Victorian epoch it had no disproportionately\r\nrich people.\r\n\r\nIn America, except in the regions where the negro abounds, there is no\r\nlower stratum. There is no \"soil people\" to this community at all; your\r\nbottom-most man is a mobile freeman who can read, and who has ideas\r\nabove digging and pigs and poultry-keeping, except incidentally for his\r\nown ends. No one owns to subordination As a consequence, any position\r\nwhich involves the acknowledgment of an innate inferiority is difficult\r\nto fill; there is, from the European point of view, an extraordinary\r\ndearth of servants, and this endures in spite of a great peasant\r\nimmigration. The servile tradition will not root here now; it dies\r\nforthwith. An enormous importation of European serfs and peasants goes\r\non, but as they touch this soil their backs begin to stiffen with a new\r\nassertion.\r\n\r\nAnd at the other end of the scale, also, one misses an element. There\r\nis no territorial aristocracy, no aristocracy at all, no throne, no\r\nlegitimate and acknowledged representative of that upper social\r\nstructure of leisure, power and State responsibility which in the old\r\nEuropean theory of Society was supposed to give significance to the\r\nwhole. The American community, one cannot too clearly insist, does not\r\ncorrespond to an entire European community at all, but only to the\r\nmiddle masses of it, to the trading and manufacturing class between the\r\ndimensions of the magnate and the clerk and skilled artisan. It is the\r\ncentral part of the European organism without either the dreaming head\r\nor the subjugated feet. Even the highly feudal slave-holding \"county\r\nfamily\" traditions of Virginia and the South pass now out of memory. So\r\nthat in a very real sense the past of the American nation is in Europe,\r\nand the settled order of the past is left behind there. This community\r\nwas, as it were, taken off its roots, clipped of its branches, and\r\nbrought hither. It began neither serf nor lord, but burgher and farmer;\r\nit followed the normal development of the middle class under Progress\r\neverywhere and became capitalistic. The huge later immigration has\r\nconverged upon the great industrial centres and added merely a vast\r\nnon-servile element of employees to the scheme.\r\n\r\nAmerica has been and still very largely is a one-class country. It is a\r\ngreat sea of human beings detached from their traditions of origin. The\r\nsocial difference from Europe appears everywhere, and nowhere more\r\nstrikingly than in the railway carriages. In England the compartments in\r\nthese are either \"first class,\" originally designed for the aristocracy,\r\nor \"second class,\" for the middle class, or \"third class,\" for the\r\npopulace. In America there is only one class, one universal simple\r\ndemocratic car. In the Southern States, however, a proportion of these\r\nsimple democratic cars are inscribed with the word \"White,\" whereby nine\r\nmillion people are excluded. But to this original even-handed treatment\r\nthere was speedily added a more sumptuous type of car, the parlour car,\r\naccessible to extra dollars; and then came special types of train, all\r\nmade up of parlour cars and observation cars and the like. In England\r\nnearly every train remains still first, second and third, or first and\r\nthird. And now, quite outdistancing the differentiation of England,\r\nAmerica produces private cars and private trains, such as Europe\r\nreserves only for crowned heads.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of the American railways, then, suggests very strongly what\r\na hundred other signs confirm, that the huge classless sea of American\r\npopulation is not destined to remain classless, is already developing\r\nseparations and distinctions and structures of its own. And monstrous\r\narchitectural portents in Boston and Salt Lake City encourage one to\r\nsuppose that even that churchless aspect, which so stirred the\r\nspeculative element in Mr. Henry James, is only the opening formless\r\nphase of a community destined to produce not only classes but\r\nintellectual and moral forms of the most remarkable kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3\r\n\r\nIt is well to note how these ninety millions of people whose social\r\nfuture we are discussing are distributed. This huge development of human\r\nappliances and resources is here going on in a community that is still,\r\nfor all the dense crowds of New York, the teeming congestion of East\r\nSide, extraordinarily scattered. America, one recalls, is still an\r\nunoccupied country across which the latest developments of civilisation\r\nare rushing. We are dealing here with a continuous area of land which\r\nis, leaving Alaska out of account altogether, equal to Great Britain,\r\nFrance, the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Italy, Belgium,\r\nJapan, Holland, Spain and Portugal, Sweden and Norway, Turkey in Europe,\r\nEgypt and the whole Empire of India, and the population spread out over\r\nthis vast space is still less than the joint population of the first two\r\ncountries named and not a quarter that of India.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is not spread at all evenly. Much of it is in undistributed\r\nclots. It is not upon the soil; barely half of it is in holdings and\r\nhomes and authentic communities. It is a population of an extremely\r\nmodern type. Urban concentration has already gone far with it; fifteen\r\nmillions of it are crowded into and about twenty great cities, another\r\neighteen millions make up five hundred towns. Between these centres of\r\npopulation run railways indeed, telegraph wires, telephone connections,\r\ntracks of various sorts, but to the European eye these are mere\r\nscratchings on a virgin surface. An empty wilderness manifests itself\r\nthrough this thin network of human conveniences, appears in the meshes\r\neven at the railroad side.\r\n\r\nEssentially, America is still an unsettled land, with only a few\r\nincidental good roads in favoured places, with no universal police, with\r\nno wayside inns where a civilised man may rest, with still only the\r\ncrudest of rural postal deliveries, with long stretches of swamp and\r\nforest and desert by the track side, still unassailed by industry. This\r\nmuch one sees clearly enough eastward of Chicago. Westward it becomes\r\nmore and more the fact. In Idaho, at last, comes the untouched and\r\nperhaps invincible desert, plain and continuous through the long hours\r\nof travel. Huge areas do not contain one human being to the square mile,\r\nstill vaster portions fall short of two....\r\n\r\nIt is upon Pennsylvania and New York State and the belt of great towns\r\nthat stretches out past Chicago to Milwaukee and Madison that the nation\r\ncentres and seems destined to centre. One needs but examine a tinted\r\npopulation map to realise that. The other concentrations are provincial\r\nand subordinate; they have the same relation to the main axis that\r\nGlasgow or Cardiff have to London in the British scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 4\r\n\r\nWhen I speak of this vast multitude, these ninety millions of the United\r\nStates of America as being for the most part peasants de-peasant-ised\r\nand common people cut off from their own social traditions, I do not\r\nintend to convey that the American community is as a whole\r\ntraditionless. There is in America a very distinctive tradition indeed,\r\nwhich animates the entire nation, gives a unique idiom to its press and\r\nall its public utterances, and is manifestly the starting point from\r\nwhich the adjustments of the future must be made.\r\n\r\nThe mere sight of the stars and stripes serves to recall it; \"Yankee\" in\r\nthe mouth of a European gives something of its quality. One thinks at\r\nonce of a careless abandonment of any pretension, of tireless energy\r\nand daring enterprise, of immense self-reliance, of a disrespect for the\r\npast so complete that a mummy is in itself a comical object, and the\r\nblowing out of an ill-guarded sacred flame, a delightful jest. One\r\nthinks of the enterprise of the sky-scraper and the humour of \"A Yankee\r\nat the Court of King Arthur,\" and of \"Innocents Abroad.\" Its dominant\r\nnotes are democracy, freedom, and confidence. It is religious-spirited\r\nwithout superstition consciously Christian in the vein of a nearly\r\nUnitarian Christianity, fervent but broadened, broadened as a halfpenny\r\nis broadened by being run over by an express train, substantially the\r\nsame, that is to say, but with a marked loss of outline and detail. It\r\nis a tradition of romantic concession to good and inoffensive women and\r\na high development of that personal morality which puts sexual\r\ncontinence and alcoholic temperance before any public virtue. It is\r\nequally a tradition of sporadic emotional public-spiritedness, entirely\r\nof the quality of gallantry, of handsome and surprising gifts to the\r\npeople, disinterested occupation of office and the like. It is\r\nemotionally patriotic, hypotheticating fighting and dying for one's\r\ncountry as a supreme good while inculcating also that working and living\r\nfor oneself is quite within the sphere of virtuous action. It adores the\r\nflag but suspects the State. One sees more national flags and fewer\r\nnational servants in America than in any country in the world. Its\r\nconception of manners is one of free plain-spoken men revering women and\r\nshielding them from most of the realities of life, scornful of\r\naristocracies and monarchies, while asserting simply, directly, boldly\r\nand frequently an equal claim to consideration with all other men. If\r\nthere is any traditional national costume, it is shirt-sleeves. And it\r\ncherishes the rights of property above any other right whatsoever.\r\n\r\nSuch are the details that come clustering into one's mind in response to\r\nthe phrase, the American tradition.\r\n\r\nFrom the War of Independence onward until our own times that tradition,\r\nthat very definite ideal, has kept pretty steadily the same. It is the\r\nimage of a man and not the image of a State. Its living spirit has been\r\nthe spirit of freedom at any cost, unconditional and irresponsible. It\r\nis the spirit of men who have thrown off a yoke, who are jealously\r\nresolved to be unhampered masters of their \"own,\" to whom nothing else\r\nis of anything but secondary importance. That was the spirit of the\r\nEnglish small gentry and mercantile class, the comfortable property\r\nowners, the Parliamentarians, in Stuart times. Indeed even earlier, it\r\nis very largely the spirit of More's \"Utopia.\" It was that spirit sent\r\nOliver Cromwell himself packing for America, though a heedless and\r\nill-advised and unforeseeing King would not let him go. It was the\r\nspirit that made taxation for public purposes the supreme wrong and\r\nprovoked each country, first the mother country and then in its turn the\r\ndaughter country, to armed rebellion. It has been the spirit of the\r\nBritish Whig and the British Nonconformist almost up to the present day.\r\nIn the Reform Club of London, framed and glazed over against Magna\r\nCharta, is the American Declaration of Independence, kindred trophies\r\nthey are of the same essentially English spirit of stubborn\r\ninsubordination. But the American side of it has gone on unchecked by\r\nthe complementary aspect of the English character which British Toryism\r\nexpresses.\r\n\r\nThe War of Independence raised that Whig suspicion of and hostility to\r\ngovernment and the freedom of private property and the repudiation of\r\nany but voluntary emotional and supererogatory co-operation in the\r\nnational purpose to the level of a religion, and the American\r\nConstitution with but one element of elasticity in the Supreme Court\r\ndecisions, established these principles impregnably in the political\r\nstructure. It organised disorganisation. Personal freedom, defiance of\r\nauthority, and the stars and stripes have always gone together in men's\r\nminds; and subsequent waves of immigration, the Irish fleeing famine,\r\nfor which they held the English responsible, and the Eastern European\r\nJews escaping relentless persecutions, brought a persuasion of immense\r\npublic wrongs, as a necessary concomitant of systematic government, to\r\nrefresh without changing this defiant thirst for freedom at any cost.\r\n\r\nIn my book, \"The Future in America,\" I have tried to make an estimate of\r\nthe working quality of this American tradition of unconditional freedom\r\nfor the adult male citizen. I have shown that from the point of view of\r\nanyone who regards civilisation as an organisation of human\r\ninterdependence and believes that the stability of society can be\r\nsecured only by a conscious and disciplined co-ordination of effort, it\r\nis a tradition extraordinarily and dangerously deficient in what I have\r\ncalled a \"_sense of the State_.\" And by a \"sense of the State\" I mean\r\nnot merely a vague and sentimental and showy public-spiritedness--of\r\nthat the States have enough and to spare--but a real sustaining\r\nconception of the collective interest embodied in the State as an object\r\nof simple duty and as a determining factor in the life of each\r\nindividual. It involves a sense of function and a sense of \"place,\" a\r\nsense of a general responsibility and of a general well-being\r\noverriding the individual's well-being, which are exactly the senses the\r\nAmerican tradition attacks and destroys.\r\n\r\nFor the better part of a century the American tradition, quite as much\r\nby reason of what it disregards as of what it suggests, has meant a\r\ngreat release of human energy, a vigorous if rough and untidy\r\nexploitation of the vast resources that the European invention of\r\nrailways and telegraphic communication put within reach of the American\r\npeople. It has stimulated men to a greater individual activity, perhaps,\r\nthan the world has ever seen before. Men have been wasted by\r\nmisdirection no doubt, but there has been less waste by inaction and\r\nlassitude than was the case in any previous society. Great bulks of\r\nthings and great quantities of things have been produced, huge areas\r\nbrought under cultivation, vast cities reared in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nBut this tradition has failed to produce the beginnings or promise of\r\nany new phase of civilised organisation, the growths have remained\r\nlargely invertebrate and chaotic, and, concurrently with its gift of\r\nsplendid and monstrous growth, it has also developed portentous\r\npolitical and economic evils. No doubt the increment of human energy has\r\nbeen considerable, but it has been much less than appears at first\r\nsight. Much of the human energy that America has displayed in the last\r\ncentury is not a development of new energy but a diversion. It has been\r\naccompanied by a fall in the birth-rate that even the immigration\r\ntorrent has not altogether replaced. Its insistence on the individual,\r\nits disregard of the collective organisation, its treatment of women and\r\nchildren as each man's private concern, has had its natural outcome.\r\nMen's imaginations have been turned entirely upon individual and\r\nimmediate successes and upon concrete triumphs; they have had no regard\r\nor only an ineffectual sentimental regard for the race. Every man was\r\nlooking after himself, and there was no one to look after the future.\r\nHad the promise of 1815 been fulfilled, there would now be in the United\r\nStates of America one hundred million descendants of the homogeneous and\r\nfree-spirited native population of that time. There is not, as a matter\r\nof fact, more than thirty-five million. There is probably, as I have\r\npointed out, much less. Against the assets of cities, railways, mines\r\nand industrial wealth won, the American tradition has to set the price\r\nof five-and-seventy million native citizens who have never found time to\r\nget born, and whose place is now more or less filled by alien\r\nsubstitutes. Biologically speaking, this is not a triumph for the\r\nAmerican tradition. It is, however, very clearly an outcome of the\r\nintense individualism of that tradition. Under the sway of that it has\r\nburnt its future in the furnace to keep up steam.\r\n\r\nThe next and necessary evil consequent upon this exaltation of the\r\nindividual and private property over the State, over the race that is\r\nand over public property, has been a contempt for public service. It has\r\nidentified public spirit with spasmodic acts of public beneficence. The\r\nAmerican political ideal became a Cincinnatus whom nobody sent for and\r\nwho therefore never left his plough. There has ensued a corrupt and\r\nundignified political life, speaking claptrap, dark with violence,\r\nilliterate and void of statesmanship or science, forbidding any healthy\r\nsocial development through public organisation at home, and every year\r\nthat the increasing facilities of communication draw the alien nations\r\ncloser, deepening the risks of needless and disastrous wars abroad.\r\n\r\nAnd in the third place it is to be remarked that the American tradition\r\nhas defeated its dearest aims of a universal freedom and a practical\r\nequality. The economic process of the last half-century, so far as\r\nAmerica is concerned has completely justified the generalisations of\r\nMarx. There has been a steady concentration of wealth and of the reality\r\nas distinguished from the forms of power in the hands of a small\r\nenergetic minority, and a steady approximation of the condition of the\r\nmass of the citizens to that of the so-called proletariat of the\r\nEuropean communities. The tradition of individual freedom and equality\r\nis, in fact, in process of destroying the realities of freedom and\r\nequality out of which it rose. Instead of the six hundred thousand\r\nfamilies of the year 1790, all at about the same level of property and,\r\nexcepting the peculiar condition of seven hundred thousand blacks, with\r\nscarcely anyone in the position of a hireling, we have now as the most\r\nstriking, though by no means the most important, fact in American social\r\nlife a frothy confusion of millionaires' families, just as wasteful,\r\nfoolish and vicious as irresponsible human beings with unlimited\r\nresources have always shown themselves to be. And, concurrently with the\r\nappearance of these concentrations of great wealth, we have appearing\r\nalso poverty, poverty of a degree that was quite unknown in the United\r\nStates for the first century of their career as an independent nation.\r\nIn the last few decades slums as frightful as any in Europe have\r\nappeared with terrible rapidity, and there has been a development of the\r\nviler side of industrialism, of sweating and base employment of the most\r\nominous kind.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Robert Hunter's \"Poverty\" one reads of \"not less than eighty\r\nthousand children, most of whom are little girls, at present employed in\r\nthe textile mills of this country. In the South there are now six times\r\nas many children at work as there were twenty years ago. Child labour is\r\nincreasing yearly in that section of the country. Each year more little\r\nones are brought in from the fields and hills to live in the degrading\r\nand demoralising atmosphere of the mill towns....\"\r\n\r\nChildren are deliberately imported by the Italians. I gathered from\r\nCommissioner Watchorn at Ellis Island that the proportion of little\r\nnephews and nieces, friends' sons and so forth brought in by them is\r\npeculiarly high, and I heard him try and condemn a doubtful case. It was\r\na particularly unattractive Italian in charge of a dull-eyed little boy\r\nof no ascertainable relationship....\r\n\r\nIn the worst days of cotton-milling in England the conditions were\r\nhardly worse than those now existing in the South. Children, the tiniest\r\nand frailest, of five and six years of age, rise in the morning and,\r\nlike old men and women, go to the mills to do their day's labour; and,\r\nwhen they return home, \"wearily fling themselves on their beds, too\r\ntired to take off their clothes.\" Many children work all night--\"in the\r\nmaddening racket of the machinery, in an atmosphere insanitary and\r\nclouded with humidity and lint.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be long,\" adds Mr. Hunter in his description, \"before I forget\r\nthe face of a little boy of six years, with his hands stretched forward\r\nto rearrange a bit of machinery, his pallid face and spare form already\r\nshowing the physical effects of labour. This child, six years of age,\r\nwas working twelve hours a day.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Spargo's \"Bitter Cry of the Children\" I learn this much of the\r\njoys of certain among the youth of Pennsylvania:\r\n\r\n\"For ten or eleven hours a day children of ten and eleven stoop over the\r\nchute and pick out the slate and other impurities from the coal as it\r\nmoves past them. The air is black with coal dust, and the roar of the\r\ncrushers, screens and rushing mill-race of coal is deafening. Sometimes\r\none of the children falls into the machinery and is terribly mangled, or\r\nslips into the chute and is smothered to death. Many children are killed\r\nin this way. Many others, after a time, contract coal-miners asthma and\r\nconsumption, which gradually undermine their health. Breathing\r\ncontinually day after day the clouds of coal dust, their lungs become\r\nblack and choked with small particles of anthracite....\"\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts, at Fall River, the Hon. J.F. Carey tells how little\r\nnaked boys, free Americans, work for Mr. Borden, the New York\r\nmillionaire, packing cloth into bleaching vats, in a bath of chemicals\r\nthat bleaches their little bodies like the bodies of lepers....\r\n\r\nAltogether it would seem that at least one million and a half children\r\nare growing up in the United States of America stunted and practically\r\nuneducated because of unregulated industrialism. These children,\r\nill-fed, ill-trained mentally benighted, since they are alive and\r\nactive, since they are an active and positive and not a negative evil,\r\nare even more ominous in the American outlook than those five and sixty\r\nmillion of good race and sound upbringing who will now never be born.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 5\r\n\r\nIt must be repeated that the American tradition is really the tradition\r\nof one particular ingredient in this great admixture and stirring up of\r\npeoples. This ingredient is the Colonial British, whose seventeenth\r\ncentury Puritanism and eighteenth century mercantile radicalism and\r\nrationalism manifestly furnished all the stuff out of which the American\r\ntradition is made. It is this stuff planted in virgin soil and inflated\r\nto an immense and buoyant optimism by colossal and unanticipated\r\nmaterial prosperity and success. From that British middle-class\r\ntradition comes the individualist protestant spirit, the keen\r\nself-reliance and personal responsibility, the irresponsible\r\nexpenditure, the indiscipline and mystical faith in things being managed\r\nproperly if they are only let alone. \"State-blindness\" is the natural\r\nand almost inevitable quality of a middle-class tradition, a class that\r\nhas been forced neither to rule nor obey, which has been concentrated\r\nand successfully concentrated on private gain.\r\n\r\nThis middle-class British section of the American population was, and is\r\nto this day, the only really articulate ingredient in its mental\r\ncomposition. And so it has had a monopoly in providing the American\r\nforms of thought. The other sections of peoples that have been annexed\r\nby or have come into this national synthesis are _silent_ so far as any\r\ncontribution to the national stock of ideas and ideals is concerned.\r\nThere are, for example, those great elements, the Spanish Catholics, the\r\nFrench Catholic population of Louisiana, the Irish Catholics, the\r\nFrench-Canadians who are now ousting the sterile New Englander from New\r\nEngland, the Germans, the Italians the Hungarians. Comparatively they\r\nsay nothing. From all the ten million of coloured people come just two\r\nor three platform voices, Booker Washington, Dubois, Mrs. Church\r\nTerrell, mere protests at specific wrongs. The clever, restless Eastern\r\nEuropean Jews, too, have still to find a voice. Professor M\u00fcnsterberg\r\nhas written with a certain bitterness of the inaudibility of the German\r\nelement in the American population. They allow themselves, he\r\nremonstrates, to count for nothing. They did not seem to exist, he\r\npoints out, even in politics until prohibitionist fury threatened their\r\nbeer. Then, indeed, the American German emerged from silence and\r\nobscurity, but only to rescue his mug and retire again with it into\r\nenigmatical silence.\r\n\r\nIf there is any exception to this predominance of the tradition of the\r\nEnglish-speaking, originally middle-class, English-thinking northerner\r\nin the American mind, it is to be found in the spread of social\r\ndemocracy outward from the festering tenement houses of Chicago into the\r\nmining and agrarian regions of the middle west. It is a fierce form of\r\nsocialist teaching that speaks throughout these regions, far more\r\nclosely akin to the revolutionary Socialism of the continent of Europe\r\nthan to the constructive and evolutionary Socialism of Great Britain.\r\nIts typical organ is _The Appeal to Reason_, which circulates more than\r\na quarter of a million copies weekly from Kansas City. It is a Socialism\r\nreeking with class feeling and class hatred and altogether anarchistic\r\nin spirit; a new and highly indigestible contribution to the American\r\nmoral and intellectual synthesis. It is remarkable chiefly as the one\r\nshrill exception in a world of plastic acceptance.\r\n\r\nNow it is impossible to believe that this vast silence of these\r\nimported and ingested factors that the American nation has taken to\r\nitself is as acquiescent as it seems. No doubt they are largely taking\r\nover the traditional forms of American thought and expression quietly\r\nand without protest, and wearing them; but they will wear them as a man\r\nwears a misfit, shaping and adapting it every day more and more to his\r\nnatural form, here straining a seam and there taking in a looseness. A\r\nforce of modification must be at work. It must be at work in spite of\r\nthe fact that, with the exception of social democracy, it does not\r\nanywhere show as a protest or a fresh beginning or a challenge to the\r\nprevailing forms.\r\n\r\nHow far it has actually been at work is, perhaps, to be judged best by\r\nan observant stroller, surveying the crowds of a Sunday evening in New\r\nYork, or read in the sheets of such a mirror of popular taste as the\r\nSunday edition of the _New York American_ or the _New York Herald_. In\r\nthe former just what I mean by the silent modification of the old\r\ntradition is quite typically shown. Its leading articles are written by\r\nMr. Arthur Brisbane, the son of one of the Brook Farm Utopians, that\r\ngathering in which Hawthorne and Henry James senior, and Margaret Fuller\r\nparticipated, and in which the whole brilliant world of Boston's past,\r\nthe world of Emerson, Longfellow, Thoreau, was interested. Mr. Brisbane\r\nis a very distinguished man, quite over and above the fact that he is\r\npaid the greatest salary of any journalist in the world. He writes with\r\na wit and directness that no other living man can rival, and he holds up\r\nconstantly what is substantially the American ideal of the past century\r\nto readers who evidently need strengthening in it. It is, of course, the\r\nfigure of a man and not of a State; it is a man, clean, clean shaved\r\nand almost obtrusively strong-jawed, honest, muscular, alert, pushful,\r\nchivalrous, self-reliant, non-political except when he breaks into\r\nshrewd and penetrating voting--\"you can fool all the people some of the\r\ntime,\" etc.--and independent--independent--in a world which is therefore\r\ncertain to give way to him.\r\n\r\nHis doubts, his questionings, his aspirations, are dealt with by Mr.\r\nBrisbane with a simple direct fatherliness with all the beneficent\r\npersuasiveness of a revivalist preacher. Millions read these leaders and\r\nfeel a momentary benefit, en route for the more actual portions of the\r\npaper. He asks: \"Why are all men gamblers?\" He discusses our Longing for\r\nImmortal Imperfection, and \"Did we once live on the moon?\" He recommends\r\nthe substitution of whisky and soda for neat whisky, drawing an\r\nillustration from the comparative effect of the diluted and of the\r\nundiluted liquid as an eye-wash (\"Try whisky on your friend's eyeball!\"\r\nis the heading), sleep (\"The man who loses sleep will make a failure of\r\nhis life, or at least diminish greatly his chances of success\"), and the\r\neducation of the feminine intelligence (\"The cow that kicks her weaned\r\ncalf is all heart\"). He makes identically the same confident appeal to\r\nthe moral motive which was for so long the salvation of the Puritan\r\nindividualism from which the American tradition derives. \"That hand,\" he\r\nwrites, \"which supports the head of the new-born baby, the mother's\r\nhand, supports the civilisation of the world.\"\r\n\r\nBut that sort of thing is not saving the old native strain in the\r\npopulation. It moves people, no doubt, but inadequately. And here is a\r\npassage that is quite the quintessence of Americanism, of all its deep\r\nmoral feeling and sentimental untruthfulness. I wonder if any man but\r\nan American or a British nonconformist in a state of rhetorical\r\nexcitement ever believed that Shakespeare wrote his plays or Michael\r\nAngelo painted in a mood of humanitarian exaltation, \"_for the good of\r\nall men_.\"\r\n\r\n  \"What _shall_ we strive for? _Money_?\r\n\r\n  \"Get a thousand millions. Your day will come, and\r\n  in due course the graveyard rat will gnaw as calmly at\r\n  your bump of acquisitiveness as at the mean coat of the\r\n  pauper.\r\n\r\n  \"Then shall we strive for _power_?\r\n\r\n  \"The names of the first great kings of the world are\r\n  forgotten, and the names of all those whose power we envy\r\n  will drift to forgetfulness soon. What does the most powerful\r\n  man in the world amount to standing at the brink of\r\n  Niagara, with his solar plexus trembling? What is his\r\n  power compared with the force of the wind or the energy\r\n  of one small wave sweeping along the shore?\r\n\r\n  \"The power which man can build up within himself,\r\n  for himself, is nothing. Only the dull reasoning of gratified\r\n  egotism can make it seem worth while.\r\n\r\n  \"Then what is worth while? Let us look at some of\r\n  the men who have come and gone, and whose lives inspire\r\n  us. Take a few at random:\r\n\r\n  \"Columbus, Michael Angelo, Wilberforce, Shakespeare,\r\n  Galileo, Fulton, Watt, Hargreaves--these will do.\r\n\r\n  \"Let us ask ourselves this question: 'Was there any\r\n  _one thing_ that distinguished _all_ their lives,\r\n  that united all these men, active in fields so different?'\r\n\r\n  \"Yes. Every man among them, and every man whose\r\n  life history is worth the telling, did something for _the good\r\n  of other men_....\r\n\r\n  \"Get money if you can. Get power if you can; Then, if\r\n  you want to be more than the ten thousand million unknown\r\n  mingled in the dust beneath you, see what good you can\r\n  do with your money and your power.\r\n\r\n  \"If you are one of the many millions who have not\r\n  and can't get money or power, see what good you can do\r\n  without either:\r\n\r\n  \"You can help carry a load for an old man. You can\r\n  encourage and help a poor devil trying to reform. You\r\n  can set a good example to children. You can stick to the\r\n  men with whom you work, fighting honestly for their\r\n  welfare.\r\n\r\n  \"Time was when the ablest man would rather kill ten\r\n  men than feed a thousand children. That time has gone.\r\n  We do not care much about feeding the children, but we\r\n  care less about killing the men. To that extent we have\r\n  improved already.\r\n\r\n  \"The day will come when we shall prefer helping our\r\n  neighbour to robbing him--legally--of a million dollars.\r\n\r\n  \"Do what good you can _now_, while it is unusual,\r\n  and have the satisfaction of being a pioneer and an\r\n  eccentric.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the voice of the American tradition strained to the utmost to make\r\nitself audible to the new world, and cracking into italics and breaking\r\ninto capitals with the strain. The rest of that enormous bale of paper\r\nis eloquent of a public void of moral ambitions, lost to any sense of\r\ncomprehensive things, deaf to ideas, impervious to generalisations, a\r\npublic which has carried the conception of freedom to its logical\r\nextreme of entire individual detachment. These tell-tale columns deal\r\nall with personality and the drama of personal life. They witness to no\r\ninterest but the interest in intense individual experiences. The\r\nengagements, the love affairs, the scandals of conspicuous people are\r\ngiven in pitiless detail in articles adorned with vigorous portraits and\r\nsensational pictorial comments. Even the eavesdroppers who write this\r\nstuff strike the personal note, and their heavily muscular portraits\r\nfrown beside the initial letter. Murders and crimes are worked up to the\r\nkeenest pitch of realisation, and any new indelicacy in fashionable\r\ncostume, any new medical device or cure, any new dance or athleticism,\r\nany new breach in the moral code, any novelty in sea bathing or the\r\nwoman's seat on horseback, or the like, is given copious and moving\r\nillustration, stirring headlines, and eloquent reprobation. There is a\r\ncoloured supplement of knock-about fun, written chiefly in the quaint\r\ndialect of the New York slums. It is a language from which \"th\" has\r\nvanished, and it presents a world in which the kicking by a mule of an\r\nendless succession of victims is an inexhaustible joy to young and old.\r\n\"Dat ole Maud!\" There is a smaller bale dealing with sport. In the\r\nadvertisement columns one finds nothing of books, nothing of art; but\r\ngreat choice of bust developers, hair restorers, nervous tonics,\r\nclothing sales, self-contained flats, and business opportunities....\r\n\r\nIndividuality has, in fact, got home to itself, and, as people say,\r\ntaken off its frills. All but one; Mr. Arthur Brisbane's eloquence one\r\nmay consider as the last stitch of the old costume--mere decoration.\r\nExcitement remains the residual object in life. The _New York American_\r\nrepresents a clientele to be counted by the hundred thousand, manifestly\r\nwith no other solicitudes, just burning to live and living to burn.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 6\r\n\r\nThe modifications of the American tradition that will occur through its\r\nadoption by these silent foreign ingredients in the racial synthesis are\r\nnot likely to add to it or elaborate it in any way. They tend merely to\r\nsimplify it to bare irresponsible non-moral individualism. It is with\r\nthe detail and qualification of a tradition as with the inflexions of a\r\nlanguage; when another people takes it over the refinements disappear.\r\nBut there are other forces of modification at work upon the American\r\ntradition of an altogether more hopeful kind. It has entered upon a\r\nconstructive phase. Were it not so, then the American social outlook\r\nwould, indeed, be hopeless.\r\n\r\nThe effectual modifying force at work is not the strangeness nor the\r\ntemperamental maladjustment of the new elements of population, but the\r\nconscious realisation of the inadequacy of the tradition on the part of\r\nthe more intelligent sections of the American population. That blind\r\nnational conceit that would hear no criticism and admit no deficiency\r\nhas disappeared. In the last decade such a change has come over the\r\nAmerican mind as sometimes comes over a vigorous and wilful child.\r\nSuddenly it seems to have grown up, to have begun to weigh its powers\r\nand consider its possible deficiencies. There was a time when American\r\nconfidence and self-satisfaction seemed impregnable; at the slightest\r\nqualm of doubt America took to violent rhetoric as a drunkard resorts to\r\ndrink. Now the indictment I have drawn up harshly, bluntly and\r\nunflatteringly in Sec. 4 would receive the endorsement of American after\r\nAmerican. The falling birth-rate of all the best elements in the State,\r\nthe cankering effect of political corruption, the crumbling of\r\nindependence and equality before the progressive aggregation of\r\nwealth--he has to face them, he cannot deny them. There has arisen a new\r\nliterature, the literature of national self-examination, that seems\r\ndestined to modify the American tradition profoundly. To me it seems to\r\ninvolve the hope and possibility of a conscious collective organisation\r\nof social life.\r\n\r\nIf ever there was an epoch-marking book it was surely Henry Demarest\r\nLloyd's \"Wealth against Commonwealth.\" It marks an epoch not so much by\r\nwhat it says as by what it silently abandons. It was published in 1894,\r\nand it stated in the very clearest terms the incompatibility of the\r\nalmost limitless freedom of property set up by the constitution, with\r\nthe practical freedom and general happiness of the mass of men. It must\r\nbe admitted that Lloyd never followed up the implications of this\r\nrepudiation. He made his statements in the language of the tradition he\r\nassailed, and foreshadowed the replacement of chaos by order in quite\r\nchaotic and mystical appeals. Here, for instance, is a typical passage\r\nfrom \"Man, the Social Creator\".\r\n\r\n  \"Property is now a stumbling-block to the people, just\r\n  as government has been. Property will not be abolished,\r\n  but, like government, it will be democratised.\r\n\r\n  \"The philosophy of self-interest as the social solution\r\n  was a good living and working synthesis in the days when\r\n  civilisation was advancing its frontiers twenty miles a day\r\n  across the American continent, and every man for himself\r\n  was the best social mobilisation possible.\r\n\r\n  \"But to-day it is a belated ghost that has overstayed\r\n  the cock-crow. These were frontier morals. But this same,\r\n  everyone for himself, becomes most immoral when the\r\n  frontier is abolished and the pioneer becomes the fellow-citizen\r\n  and these frontier morals are most uneconomic when\r\n  labour can be divided and the product multiplied. Most\r\n  uneconomic, for they make closure the rule of industry,\r\n  leading not to wealth, but to that awful waste of wealth\r\n  which is made visible to every eye in our unemployed--not\r\n  hands alone, but land, machinery, and, most of all, hearts.\r\n  Those who still practise these frontier morals are like\r\n  criminals, who, according to the new science of penology,\r\n  are simply reappearances of old types. Their acquisitiveness\r\n  once divine like Mercury's, is now out of place except\r\n  in jail. Because out of place, they are a danger. A sorry\r\n  day it is likely to be for those who are found in the way\r\n  when the new people rise to rush into each other's arms,\r\n  to get together, to stay together and to live together. The\r\n  labour movement halts because so many of its rank and\r\n  file--and all its leaders--do not see clearly the golden thread\r\n  of love on which have been strung together all the past\r\n  glories of human association, and which is to serve for\r\n  the link of the new Association of Friends who Labour,\r\n  whose motto is 'All for All.'\"\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the intricate co-operative commonwealth by a rush\r\nof eighty million flushed and shiny-eyed enthusiasts, in fact, is\r\nLloyd's proposal. He will not face, and few Americans to this day will\r\nface, the cold need of a great science of social adjustment and a\r\ndisciplined and rightly ordered machinery to turn such enthusiasms to\r\neffect. They seem incurably wedded to gush. However, he did express\r\nclearly enough the opening phase of American disillusionment with the\r\nwild go-as-you-please that had been the conception of life in America\r\nthrough a vehement, wasteful, expanding century. And he was the\r\nprecursor of what is now a bulky and extremely influential literature of\r\nnational criticism. A number of writers, literary investigators one may\r\ncall them, or sociological men of letters, or magazine publicists--they\r\nare a little difficult to place--has taken up the inquiry into the\r\ncondition of civic administration, into economic organisation into\r\nnational politics and racial interaction, with a frank fearlessness and\r\nan absence of windy eloquence that has been to many Europeans a\r\nsurprising revelation of the reserve forces of the American mind.\r\nPresident Roosevelt, that magnificent reverberator of ideas, that gleam\r\nof wilful humanity, that fantastic first interruption to the succession\r\nof machine-made politicians at the White House, has echoed clearly to\r\nthis movement and made it an integral part of the general intellectual\r\nmovement of America.\r\n\r\nIt is to these first intimations of the need of a \"sense of the State\"\r\nin America that I would particularly direct the reader's attention in\r\nthis discussion. They are the beginnings of what is quite conceivably a\r\ngreat and complex reconstructive effort. I admit they are but\r\nbeginnings. They may quite possibly wither and perish presently; they\r\nmay much more probably be seized upon by adventurers and converted into\r\na new cant almost as empty and fruitless as the old. The fact remains\r\nthat, through this busy and immensely noisy confusion of nearly a\r\nhundred millions of people, these little voices go intimating more and\r\nmore clearly the intention to undertake public affairs in a new spirit\r\nand upon new principles, to strengthen the State and the law against\r\nindividual enterprise, to have done with those national superstitions\r\nunder which hypocrisy and disloyalty and private plunder have sheltered\r\nand prospered for so long.\r\n\r\nJust as far as these reform efforts succeed and develop is the\r\norganisation of the United States of America into a great,\r\nself-conscious, civilised nation, unparalleled in the world's history,\r\npossible; just as far as they fail is failure written over the American\r\nfuture. The real interest of America for the next century to the student\r\nof civilisation will be the development of these attempts, now in their\r\ninfancy, to create and realise out of this racial hotchpotch, this human\r\nchaos, an idea, of the collective commonwealth as the datum of reference\r\nfor every individual life.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 7\r\n\r\nI have hinted in the last section that there is a possibility that the\r\nnew wave of constructive ideas in American thought may speedily develop\r\na cant of its own. But even then, a constructive cant is better than a\r\ndestructive one. Even the conscious hypocrite has to do something to\r\njustify his pretences, and the mere disappearance from current thought\r\nof the persuasion that organisation is a mistake and discipline\r\nneedless, clears the ground of one huge obstacle even if it guarantees\r\nnothing about the consequent building.\r\n\r\nBut, apart from this, are there more solid and effectual forces behind\r\nthis new movement of ideas that makes for organisation in American\r\nmedley at the present time?\r\n\r\nThe speculative writer casting about for such elements lights upon four\r\nsets of possibilities which call for discussion. First, one has to ask:\r\nHow far is the American plutocracy likely to be merely a wasteful and\r\nchaotic class, and how far is it likely to become consciously\r\naristocratic and constructive? Secondly, and in relation to this, what\r\npossibilities of pride and leading are there in the great university\r\nfoundations of America? Will they presently begin to tell as a\r\nrestraining and directing force upon public thought? Thirdly, will the\r\ngrowing American Socialist movement, which at present is just as\r\nanarchistic and undisciplined in spirit as everything else in America,\r\npresently perceive the constructive implications of its general\r\npropositions and become statesmanlike and constructive? And, fourthly,\r\nwhat are the latent possibilities of the American women? Will women as\r\nthey become more and more aware of themselves as a class and of the\r\nproblem of their sex become a force upon the anarchistic side, a force\r\nfavouring race-suicide, or upon the constructive side which plans and\r\nbuilds and bears the future?\r\n\r\nThe only possible answer to each one of these questions at present is\r\nguessing and an estimate. But the only way in which a conception of the\r\nAmerican social future may be reached lies through their discussion.\r\n\r\nLet us begin by considering what constructive forces may exist in this\r\nnew plutocracy which already so largely sways American economic and\r\npolitical development. The first impression is one of extravagant and\r\naimless expenditure, of a class irresponsible and wasteful beyond all\r\nprecedent. One gets a Zolaesque picture of that aspect in Mr. Upton\r\nSinclair's \"Metropolis,\" or the fashionable intelligence of the popular\r\nNew York Sunday editions, and one finds a good deal of confirmatory\r\nevidence in many incidental aspects of the smart American life of Paris\r\nand the Riviera. The evidence in the notorious Thaw trial, after one has\r\ndiscounted its theatrical elements, was still a very convincing\r\ndemonstration of a rotten and extravagant, because aimless and\r\nfunctionless, class of rich people. But one has to be careful in this\r\nmatter if one is to do justice to the facts. If a thing is made up of\r\ntwo elements, and one is noisy and glaringly coloured, and the other is\r\nquiet and colourless, the first impression created will be that the\r\nthing is identical with the element that is noisy and glaringly\r\ncoloured. One is much less likely to hear of the broad plans and the\r\nquality of the wise, strong and constructive individuals in a class than\r\nof their foolish wives, their spendthrift sons, their mistresses, and\r\ntheir moments of irritation and folly.\r\n\r\nIn the making of very rich men there is always a factor of good fortune\r\nand a factor of design and will. One meets rich men at times who seem to\r\nbe merely lucky gamblers, who strike one as just the thousandth man in a\r\nmyriad of wild plungers, who are, in fact, chance nobodies washed up by\r\nan eddy. Others, again, strike one as exceptionally lucky half-knaves.\r\nBut there are others of a growth more deliberate and of an altogether\r\nhigher personal quality. One takes such men as Mr. J.D. Rockefeller or\r\nMr. Pierpont Morgan--the scale of their fortunes makes them public\r\nproperty--and it is clear that we are dealing with persons on quite a\r\ndifferent level of intellectual power from the British Colonel Norths,\r\nfor example, or the South African Joels. In my \"Future in America\" I\r\nhave taken the former largely at Miss Tarbell's estimate, and treated\r\nhim as a case of acquisitiveness raised in Baptist surroundings. But I\r\ndoubt very much if that exhausts the man as he is to-day. Given a man\r\nbrought up to saving and \"getting on\" as if to a religion, a man very\r\nacquisitive and very patient and restrained, and indubitably with great\r\norganising power, and he grows rich beyond the dreams of avarice. And\r\nhaving done so, there he is. What is he going to do? Every step he takes\r\nup the ascent to riches gives him new perspectives and new points of\r\nview.\r\n\r\nIt may have appealed to the young Rockefeller, clerk in a Chicago house,\r\nthat to be rich was itself a supreme end; in the first flush of the\r\ndiscovery that he was immensely rich, he may have thanked Heaven as if\r\nfor a supreme good, and spoken to a Sunday school gathering as if he\r\nknew himself for the most favoured of men. But all that happened twenty\r\nyears ago or more. One does not keep on in that sort of satisfaction;\r\none settles down to the new facts. And such men as Mr. Rockefeller and\r\nMr. Pierpont Morgan do not live in a made and protected world with their\r\nminds trained, tamed and fed and shielded from outside impressions as\r\nroyalties do. The thought of the world has washed about them; they have\r\nread and listened to the discussion of themselves for some decades; they\r\nhave had sleepless nights of self-examination. To succeed in acquiring\r\nenormous wealth does not solve the problem of life; indeed, it reopens\r\nit in a new form. \"What shall I do with myself?\" simply recurs again.\r\nYou may have decided to devote yourself to getting on, getting wealthy.\r\nWell, you have got it. Now, again, comes the question: \"What shall I\r\ndo?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pierpont Morgan, I am told, collected works of art. I can\r\nunderstand that satisfying a rich gentleman of leisure, but not a man\r\nwho has felt the sensation of holding great big things in his great big\r\nhands. Saul, going out to seek his father's asses, found a kingdom--and\r\nbecame very spiritedly a king, and it seems to me that these big\r\nindustrial and financial organisers, whatever in their youth they\r\nproposed to do or be, must many of them come to realise that their\r\norganising power is up against no less a thing than a nation's future.\r\nNapoleon, it is curious to remember once wanted to run a lodging-house,\r\nand a man may start to corner oil and end the father of a civilisation.\r\n\r\nNow, I am disposed to suspect at times that an inkling of such a\r\nrealisation may have come to some of these very rich men. I am inclined\r\nto put it among the possibilities of our time that it may presently\r\nbecome clearly and definitely the inspiring idea of many of those who\r\nfind themselves predominantly rich. I do not see why these active rich\r\nshould not develop statesmanship, and I can quite imagine them\r\ndeveloping very considerable statesmanship. Because these men were able\r\nto realise their organising power in the absence of economic\r\norganisation, it does not follow that they will be fanatical for a\r\ncontinuing looseness and freedom of property. The phase of economic\r\nliberty ends itself, as Marx long ago pointed out. The American business\r\nworld becomes more and more a managed world with fewer and fewer wild\r\npossibilities of succeeding. Of all people the big millionaires should\r\nrealise this most acutely, and, in fact, there are many signs that they\r\ndo. It seems to me that the educational zeal of Mr. Andrew Carnegie and\r\nthe university and scientific endowments of Mr. Rockefeller are not\r\nmerely showy benefactions; they express a definite feeling of the\r\npresent need of constructive organisation in the social scheme. The time\r\nhas come to build. There is, I think, good reason for expecting that\r\nstatesmanship of the millionaires to become more organised and\r\nscientific and comprehensive in the coming years. It is plausible at\r\nleast to maintain that the personal quality of the American plutocracy\r\nhas risen in the last three decades, has risen from the quality of a\r\nmere irresponsible wealthy person towards that of a real aristocrat with\r\na \"sense of the State.\" That one may reckon the first hopeful\r\npossibility in the American outlook.\r\n\r\nAnd intimately connected with this development of an attitude of public\r\nresponsibility in the very rich is the decay on the one hand of the\r\npreposterous idea once prevalent in America that politics is an\r\nunsuitable interest for a \"gentleman,\" and on the other of the\r\ndemocratic jealousy of any but poor politicians. In New York they talk\r\nvery much of \"gentlemen,\" and by \"gentlemen\" they seem to mean rich men\r\n\"in society\" with a college education. Nowadays, \"gentlemen\" seem more\r\nand more disposed towards politics, and less and less towards a life of\r\nbusiness or detached refinement. President Roosevelt, for example, was\r\none of the pioneers in this new development, this restoration of\r\nvirility to the gentlemanly ideal. His career marks the appearance of a\r\nnew and better type of man in American politics, the close of the rule\r\nof the idealised nobody.\r\n\r\nThe prophecy has been made at times that the United States might develop\r\na Caesarism, and certainly the position of president might easily\r\nbecome that of an imperator. No doubt in the event of an acute failure\r\nof the national system such a catastrophe might occur, but the more\r\nhopeful and probable line of development is one in which a conscious and\r\npowerful, if informal, aristocracy will play a large part. It may,\r\nindeed, never have any of the outward forms of an aristocracy or any\r\ndefinite public recognition. The Americans are as chary of the coronet\r\nand the known aristocratic titles as the Romans were of the word King.\r\nOctavius, for that reason, never called himself king nor Italy a\r\nkingdom. He was just the Caesar of the Republic, and the Empire had been\r\nestablished for many years before the Romans fully realised that they\r\nhad returned to monarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 8\r\n\r\nThe American universities are closely connected in their development\r\nwith the appearance and growing class-consciousness of this aristocracy\r\nof wealth. The fathers of the country certainly did postulate a need of\r\nuniversities, and in every state Congress set aside public lands to\r\nfurnish a university with material resources. Every State possesses a\r\nuniversity, though in many instances these institutions are in the last\r\ndegree of feebleness. In the days of sincere democracy the starvation of\r\ngovernment and the dislike of all manifest inequalities involved the\r\nstarvation of higher education. Moreover, the entirely artificial nature\r\nof the State boundaries, representing no necessary cleavages and\r\ntraversed haphazard by the lines of communication, made some of these\r\nState foundations unnecessary and others inadequate to a convergent\r\ndemand. From the very beginning, side by side with the State\r\nuniversities, were the universities founded by benefactors; and with the\r\nevolution of new centres of population, new and extremely generous\r\nplutocratic endowments appeared. The dominant universities of America\r\nto-day, the treasure houses of intellectual prestige, are almost all of\r\nthem of plutocratic origin, and even in the State universities, if new\r\nresources are wanted to found new chairs, to supply funds for research\r\nor publication or what not, it is to the more State-conscious wealthy\r\nand not to the State legislature that the appeal is made almost as a\r\nmatter of course. The common voter, the small individualist has less\r\nconstructive imagination--is more individualistic, that is, than the big\r\nindividualist.\r\n\r\nThis great network of universities that is now spread over the States,\r\ninterchanging teachers, literature and ideas, and educating not only the\r\nprofessions but a growing proportion of business leaders and wealthy\r\npeople, must necessarily take an important part in the reconstruction of\r\nthe American tradition that is now in progress. It is giving a large and\r\nincreasing amount of attention to the subjects that bear most directly\r\nupon the peculiar practical problems of statecraft in America, to\r\npsychology, sociology and political science. It is influencing the press\r\nmore and more directly by supplying a rising proportion of journalists\r\nand creating an atmosphere of criticism and suggestion. It is keeping\r\nitself on the one hand in touch with the popular literature of public\r\ncriticism in those new and curious organs of public thought, the\r\nten-cent magazines; and on the other it is making a constantly more\r\nsolid basis of common understanding upon which the newer generation of\r\nplutocrats may meet. That older sentimental patriotism must be giving\r\nplace under its influence to a more definite and effectual conception of\r\na collective purpose. It is to the moral and intellectual influence of\r\nsustained scientific study in the universities, and a growing increase\r\nof the college-trained element in the population that we must look if we\r\nare to look anywhere for the new progressive methods, for the\r\nsubstitution of persistent, planned and calculated social development\r\nfor the former conditions of systematic neglect and corruption in public\r\naffairs varied by epileptic seizures of \"Reform.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 9\r\n\r\nA third influence that may also contribute very materially to the\r\nreconstruction of the American tradition is the Socialist movement. It\r\nis true that so far American Socialism has very largely taken an\r\nAnarchistic form, has been, in fact, little more than a revolutionary\r\nmovement of the wages-earning class against the property owner. It has\r\nalready been pointed out that it derives not from contemporary English\r\nSocialism but from the Marxist social democracy of the continent of\r\nEurope, and has not even so much of the constructive spirit as has been\r\ndeveloped by the English Socialists of the Fabian and Labour Party group\r\nor by the newer German evolutionary Socialists. Nevertheless, whenever\r\nSocialism is intelligently met by discussion or whenever it draws near\r\nto practicable realisation, it becomes, by virtue of its inherent\r\nimplications, a constructive force, and there is no reason to suppose\r\nthat it will not be intelligently met on the whole and in the long run\r\nin America. The alternative to a developing Socialism among the\r\nlabouring masses in America is that revolutionary Anarchism from which\r\nit is slowly but definitely marking itself off. In America we have to\r\nremember that we are dealing with a huge population of people who are\r\nfor the most part, and more and more evidently destined under the\r\npresent system of free industrial competition, to be either very small\r\ntraders, small farmers on the verge of debt, or wages-earners for all\r\ntheir lives. They are going to lead limited lives and worried lives--and\r\nthey know it. Nearly everyone can read and discuss now, the process of\r\nconcentrating property and the steady fixation of conditions that were\r\nonce fluid and adventurous goes on in the daylight visibly to everyone.\r\nAnd it has to be borne in mind also that these people are so far under\r\nthe sway of the American tradition that each thinks himself as good as\r\nany man and as much entitled to the fullness of life. Whatever social\r\ntradition their fathers had, whatever ideas of a place to be filled\r\nhumbly and seriously and duties to be done, have been left behind in\r\nEurope. No Church dominates the scenery of this new land, and offers in\r\nauthoritative and convincing tones consolations hereafter for lives\r\nobscurely but faithfully lived. Whatever else happens in this national\r\nfuture, upon one point the patriotic American may feel assured, and that\r\nis of an immense general discontent in the working class and of a\r\npowerful movement in search of a general betterment. The practical forms\r\nand effects of that movement will depend almost entirely upon the\r\naverage standard of life among the workers and their general education.\r\nSweated and ill-organised foreigners, such as one finds in New Jersey\r\nliving under conditions of great misery, will be fierce, impatient and\r\naltogether dangerous. They will be acutely exasperated by every picture\r\nof plutocratic luxury in their newspaper, they will readily resort to\r\ndestructive violence. The western miner, the western agriculturist,\r\nworried beyond endurance between the money-lender and railway\r\ncombinations will be almost equally prone to savage methods of\r\nexpression. _The Appeal to Reason_, for example, to which I have made\r\nearlier reference in this chapter, is furious to wreck the present\r\ncapitalistic system, but it is far too angry and impatient for that\r\nsatisfaction to produce any clear suggestion of what shall replace it.\r\n\r\nTo call this discontent of the seething underside of the American system\r\nSocialism is a misnomer. Were there no Socialism there would be just as\r\nmuch of this discontent, just the same insurgent force and desire for\r\nviolence, taking some other title and far more destructive methods. This\r\ndiscontent is a part of the same planless confusion that gives on the\r\nother side the wanton irresponsible extravagances of the smart people of\r\nNew York. But Socialism alone, of all the forms of expression adopted by\r\nthe losers in the economic struggle, contains constructive possibilities\r\nand leads its adherents towards that ideal of an organised State,\r\nplanned and developed, from which these terrible social stresses may be\r\neliminated, which is also the ideal to which sociology and the thoughts\r\nof every constructive-minded and foreseeing man in any position of life\r\ntend to-day. In the Socialist hypothesis of collective ownership and\r\nadministration as the social basis, there is the germ of a \"sense of the\r\nState\" that may ultimately develop into comprehensive conceptions of\r\nsocial order, conceptions upon which enlightened millionaires and\r\nunenlightened workers may meet at last in generous and patriotic\r\nco-operation.\r\n\r\nThe chances of the American future, then, seem to range between two\r\npossibilities just as a more or less constructive Socialism does or does\r\nnot get hold of and inspire the working mass of the population. In the\r\nworst event--given an emotional and empty hostility to property as such,\r\nmasquerading as Socialism--one has the prospect of a bitter and aimless\r\nclass war between the expropriated many and the property-holding few, a\r\nwar not of general insurrection but of localised outbreaks, strikes and\r\nbrutal suppressions, a war rising to bloody conflicts and sinking to\r\ncoarsely corrupt political contests, in which one side may prevail in\r\none locality and one in another, and which may even develop into a\r\nchronic civil war in the less-settled parts of the country or an\r\nirresistible movement for secession between west and east. That is\r\nassuming the greatest imaginable vehemence and short-sighted selfishness\r\nand the least imaginable intelligence on the part of both workers and\r\nthe plutocrat-swayed government. But if the more powerful and educated\r\nsections of the American community realise in time the immense moral\r\npossibilities of the Socialist movement, if they will trouble to\r\nunderstand its good side instead of emphasising its bad, if they will\r\nkeep in touch with it and help in the development of a constructive\r\ncontent to its propositions, then it seems to me that popular Socialism\r\nmay count as a third great factor in the making of the civilised\r\nAmerican State.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it does not seem to me probable that there can be any\r\nnational revolutionary movement or any complete arrest in the\r\ndevelopment of an aristocratic phase in American history. The area of\r\nthe country is too great and the means of communication between the\r\nworkers in different parts inadequate for a concerted rising or even for\r\neffective political action in mass. In the worst event--and it is only\r\nin the worst event that a great insurrectionary movement becomes\r\nprobable--the newspapers, magazines, telephones and telegraphs, all the\r\napparatus of discussion and popular appeal, the railways, arsenals,\r\nguns, flying machines, and all the material of warfare, will be in the\r\nhands of the property owners, and the average of betrayal among the\r\nleaders of a class, not racially homogeneous, embittered, suspicious\r\nunited only by their discomforts and not by any constructive intentions,\r\nwill necessarily be high. So that, though the intensifying trouble\r\nbetween labour and capital may mean immense social disorganisation and\r\nlawlessness, though it may even supply the popular support in new\r\nattempts at secession, I do not see in it the possibility and force for\r\nthat new start which the revolutionary Socialists anticipate; I see it\r\nmerely as one of several forces making, on the whole and particularly in\r\nview of the possible mediatory action of the universities, for\r\nconstruction and reconciliation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 10\r\n\r\nWhat changes are likely to occur in the more intimate social life of the\r\npeople of the United States? Two influences are at work that may modify\r\nthis profoundly. One is that spread of knowledge and that accompanying\r\nchange in moral attitude which is more and more sterilising the once\r\nprolific American home, and the second is the rising standard of\r\nfeminine education. There has arisen in this age a new consciousness in\r\nwomen. They are entering into the collective thought to a degree\r\nunprecedented in the world's history, and with portents at once\r\ndisquieting and confused.\r\n\r\nIn Sec. 5 I enumerated what I called the silent factors in the American\r\nsynthesis, the immigrant European aliens, the Catholics, the coloured\r\nblood, and so forth. I would now observe that, in the making of the\r\nAmerican tradition, the women also have been to a large extent, and\r\nquite remarkably, a silent factor. That tradition is not only\r\nfundamentally middle-class and English, but it is also fundamentally\r\nmasculine. The citizen is the man. The woman belongs to him. He votes\r\nfor her, works for her, does all the severer thinking for her. She is in\r\nthe home behind the shop or in the dairy at the farmhouse with her\r\ndaughters. She gets the meal while the men talk. The American\r\nimagination and American feeling centre largely upon the family and upon\r\n\"mother.\" American ideals are homely. The social unit is the home, and\r\nit is another and a different set of influences and considerations that\r\nare never thought of at all when the home sentiment is under discussion,\r\nthat, indeed, it would be indelicate to mention at such a time, which\r\nare making that social unit the home of one child or of no children at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThat ideal of a man-owned, mother-revering home has been the prevalent\r\nAmerican ideal from the landing of the _Mayflower_ right down to the\r\nleader writing of Mr. Arthur Brisbane. And it is clear that a very\r\nconsiderable section among one's educated women contemporaries do not\r\nmean to stand this ideal any longer. They do not want to be owned and\r\ncherished, and they do not want to be revered. How far they represent\r\ntheir sex in this matter it is very hard to say. In England in the\r\nprofessional and most intellectually active classes it is scarcely an\r\nexaggeration to say that _all_ the most able women below five-and-thirty\r\nare workers for the suffrage and the ideal of equal and independent\r\ncitizenship, and active critics of the conventions under which women\r\nlive to-day. It is at least plausible to suppose that a day is\r\napproaching when the alternatives between celibacy or a life of economic\r\ndependence and physical subordination to a man who has chosen her, and\r\nupon whose kindness her happiness depends, or prostitution, will no\r\nlonger be a satisfactory outlook for the great majority of women, and\r\nwhen, with a newly aroused political consciousness, they will be\r\nprepared to exert themselves as a class to modify this situation. It may\r\nbe that this is incorrect, and that in devotion to an accepted male and\r\nhis children most women do still and will continue to find their\r\ngreatest satisfaction in life. But it is the writer's impression that so\r\nsimple and single-hearted a devotion is rare, and that, released from\r\ntradition--and education, reading and discussion do mean release from\r\ntradition--women are as eager for initiative, freedom and experience as\r\nmen. In that case they will persist in the present agitation for\r\npolitical rights, and these secured, go on to demand a very considerable\r\nreconstruction of our present social order.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to point the direction in which this desire for\r\nindependence will probably take them. They will discover that the\r\ndependence of women at the present time is not so much a law-made as an\r\neconomic dependence due to the economic disadvantages their sex imposes\r\nupon them. Maternity and the concomitants of maternity are the\r\ncircumstances in their lives, exhausting energy and earning nothing,\r\nthat place them at a discount. From the stage when property ceased to be\r\nchiefly the creation of feminine agricultural toil (the so-called\r\nprimitive matriarchate) to our present stage, women have had to depend\r\nupon a man's willingness to keep them, in order to realise the organic\r\npurpose of their being. Whether conventionally equal or not, whether\r\nvoters or not, that necessity for dependence will still remain under our\r\nsystem of private property and free independent competition. There is\r\nonly one evident way by which women as a class can escape from that\r\ndependence each upon an individual man and from all the practical\r\ninferiority this dependence entails, and that is by so altering their\r\nstatus as to make maternity and the upbringing of children a charge not\r\nupon the husband of the mother but upon the community. The public\r\nEndowment of Maternity is the only route by which the mass of women can\r\nreach that personal freedom and independent citizenship so many of them\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nNow, this idea of the Endowment of Maternity--or as it is frequently\r\nphrased, the Endowment of the Home--is at present put forward by the\r\nmodern Socialists as an integral part of their proposals, and it is\r\ninteresting to note that there is this convergent possibility which may\r\nbring the feminist movement at last altogether into line with\r\nconstructive Socialism. Obviously, before anything in the direction of\r\nfamily endowment becomes practicable, public bodies and the State\r\norganisation will need to display far more integrity and efficiency\r\nthan they do in America at the present time. Still, that is the trend of\r\nthings in all contemporary civilised communities, and it is a trend that\r\nwill find a powerful reinforcement in men's solicitudes as the\r\nincreasing failure of the unsupported private family to produce\r\noffspring adequate to the needs of social development becomes more and\r\nmore conspicuous. The impassioned appeals of President Roosevelt have\r\nalready brought home the race-suicide of the native-born to every\r\nAmerican intelligence, but mere rhetoric will not in itself suffice to\r\nmake people, insecurely employed and struggling to maintain a\r\ncomfortable standard of life against great economic pressure, prolific.\r\nPresented as a call to a particularly onerous and quite unpaid social\r\nduty the appeal for unrestricted parentage fails. Husband and wife alike\r\ndread an excessive burthen. Travel, leisure, freedom, comfort, property\r\nand increased ability for business competition are the rewards of\r\nabstinence from parentage, and even the disapproval of President\r\nRoosevelt and the pride of offspring are insufficient counterweights to\r\nthese inducements. Large families disappear from the States, and more\r\nand more couples are childless. Those who have children restrict their\r\nnumber in order to afford those they have some reasonable advantage in\r\nlife. This, in the presence of the necessary knowledge, is as\r\npractically inevitable a consequence of individualist competition and\r\nthe old American tradition as the appearance of slums and a class of\r\nmillionaires.\r\n\r\nThese facts go to the very root of the American problem. I have already\r\npointed out that, in spite of a colossal immigration, the population of\r\nthe United States was at the end of the nineteenth century over twenty\r\nmillions short of what it should have been through its own native\r\nincrease had the birth-rate of the opening of the century been\r\nmaintained. For a hundred years America has been \"fed\" by Europe. That\r\nfeeding process will not go on indefinitely. The immigration came in\r\nwaves as if reservoir after reservoir was tapped and exhausted. Nowadays\r\nEngland, Scotland, Ireland, France and Scandinavia send hardly any more;\r\nthey have no more to send. Germany and Switzerland send only a few. The\r\nSouth European and Austrian supply is not as abundant as it was. There\r\nmay come a time when Europe and Western Asia will have no more surplus\r\npopulation to send, when even Eastern Asia will have passed into a less\r\nfecund phase, and when America will have to look to its own natural\r\nincrease for the continued development of its resources.\r\n\r\nIf the present isolated family of private competition is still the\r\nsocial unit, it seems improbable that there will be any greater natural\r\nincrease than there is in France.\r\n\r\nWill the growing idea of a closer social organisation have developed by\r\nthat time to the possibility of some collective effort in this matter?\r\nOr will that only come about after the population of the world has\r\npassed through a phase of absolute recession? The peculiar constitution\r\nof the United States gives a remarkable freedom of experiment in these\r\nmatters to each individual state, and local developments do not need to\r\nwait upon a national change of opinion; but, on the other hand, the\r\nsuperficial impression of an English visitor is that any such profound\r\ninterference with domestic autonomy runs counter to all that Americans\r\nseem to hold dear at the present time. These are, however, new ideas and\r\nnew considerations that have still to be brought adequately before the\r\nnational consciousness, and it is quite impossible to calculate how a\r\npopulation living under changing conditions and with a rising standard\r\nof education and a developing feminine consciousness may not think and\r\nfeel and behave in a generation's time. At present for all political and\r\ncollective action America is a democracy of untutored individualist men\r\nwho will neither tolerate such interference between themselves and the\r\nwomen they choose to marry as the Endowment of Motherhood implies, nor\r\nview the \"kids\" who will at times occur even in the best-regulated\r\nfamilies as anything but rather embarrassing, rather amusing by-products\r\nof the individual affections.\r\n\r\nI find in the London _New Age_ for August 15th, 1908, a description by\r\nMr. Jerome K. Jerome of \"John Smith,\" the average British voter. John\r\nSmith might serve in some respects for the common man of all the modern\r\ncivilisations. Among other things that John Smith thinks and wants, he\r\nwants:\r\n\r\n  \"a little house and garden in the country all to himself.\r\n  His idea is somewhere near half an acre of ground. He\r\n  would like a piano in the best room; it has always been his\r\n  dream to have a piano. The youngest girl, he is convinced,\r\n  is musical. As a man who has knocked about the world\r\n  and has thought, he quite appreciates the argument that\r\n  by co-operation the material side of life can be greatly\r\n  improved. He quite sees that by combining a dozen families\r\n  together in one large house better practical results can be\r\n  obtained. It is as easy to direct the cooking for a hundred\r\n  as for half a dozen. There would be less waste of food, of\r\n  coals, of lighting. To put aside one piano for one girl is\r\n  absurd. He sees all this, but it does not alter one little\r\n  bit his passionate craving for that small house and garden\r\n  all to himself. He is built that way. He is typical of a\r\n  good many other men and women built on the same pattern.\r\n  What are you going to do with them? Change them--their\r\n  instincts, their very nature, rooted in the centuries?\r\n  Or, as an alternative, vary Socialism to fit John Smith?\r\n  Which is likely to prove the shorter operation?\"\r\n\r\nThat, however, is by the way. Here is the point at issue:\r\n\r\n  \"He has heard that Socialism proposes to acknowledge\r\n  woman's service to the State by paying her a weekly wage\r\n  according to the number of children that she bears and\r\n  rears. I don't propose to repeat his objections to the idea;\r\n  they could hardly be called objections. There is an ugly\r\n  look comes into his eyes; something quite undefinable,\r\n  prehistoric, almost dangerous, looks out of them.... In\r\n  talking to him on this subject you do not seem to be\r\n  talking to a man. It is as if you had come face to face\r\n  with something behind civilisation, behind humanity, something\r\n  deeper down still among the dim beginnings of\r\n  creation....\"\r\n\r\nNow, no doubt Mr. Jerome is writing with emphasis here. But there is\r\nsufficient truth in the passage for it to stand here as a rough symbol\r\nof another factor in this question. John Smithism, that manly and\r\nindividualist element in the citizen, stands over against and resists\r\nall the forces of organisation that would subjugate it to a collective\r\npurpose. It is careless of coming national cessation and depopulation,\r\ncareless of the insurgent spirit beneath the acquiescences of Mrs.\r\nSmith, careless of its own inevitable defeat in the economic struggle,\r\ncareless because it can understand none of these things; it is\r\nobstinately muddle-headed, asserting what it conceives to be itself\r\nagainst the universe and all other John Smiths whatsoever. It is a\r\nfactor with all other factors. The creative, acquisitive, aggressive\r\nspirit of those bigger John Smiths who succeed as against the myriads of\r\nJohn Smiths who fail, the wider horizons and more efficient methods of\r\nthe educated man, the awakening class-consciousness of women, the\r\ninevitable futility of John Smithism, the sturdy independence that makes\r\nJohn Smith resent even disciplined co-operation with Tom Brown to\r\nachieve a common end, his essential incapacity, indeed, for collective\r\naction; all these things are against the ultimate triumph, and make for\r\nthe ultimate civilisation even of John Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 11\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted if the increasing collective organisation of society\r\nto which the United States of America, in common with all the rest of\r\nthe world, seem to be tending will be to any very large extent a\r\nnational organisation. The constitution is an immense and complicated\r\nbarrier to effectual centralisation. There are many reasons for\r\nsupposing the national government will always remain a little\r\nineffectual and detached from the full flow of American life, and this\r\nnotwithstanding the very great powers with which the President is\r\nendowed.\r\n\r\nOne of these reasons is certainly the peculiar accident that has placed\r\nthe seat of government upon the Potomac. To the thoughtful visitor to\r\nthe United States this hiding away of the central government in a minute\r\ndistrict remote from all the great centres of thought, population and\r\nbusiness activity becomes more remarkable more perplexing, more\r\nsuggestive of an incurable weakness in the national government as he\r\ngrasps more firmly the peculiarities of the American situation.\r\n\r\nI do not see how the central government of that great American nation of\r\nwhich I dream can possibly be at Washington, and I do not see how the\r\npresent central government can possibly be transferred to any other\r\ncentre. But to go to Washington, to see and talk to Washington, is to\r\nreceive an extraordinary impression of the utter isolation and\r\nhopelessness of Washington. The National Government has an air of being\r\nmarooned there. Or as though it had crept into a corner to do something\r\nin the dark. One goes from the abounding movement and vitality of the\r\nnorthern cities to this sunny and enervating place through the\r\nnegligently cultivated country of Virginia, and one discovers the\r\nslovenly, unfinished promise of a city, broad avenues lined by negro\r\nshanties and patches of cultivation, great public buildings and an\r\nimmense post office, a lifeless museum, an inert university, a splendid\r\ndesert library, a street of souvenir shops, a certain industry of\r\n\"seeing Washington,\" an idiotic colossal obelisk. It seems an ideal nest\r\nfor the tariff manipulator, a festering corner of delegates and agents\r\nand secondary people. In the White House, in the time of President\r\nRoosevelt, the present writer found a transitory glow of intellectual\r\nactivity, the spittoons and glass screens that once made it like a\r\nLondon gin palace had been removed, and the former orgies of handshaking\r\nreduced to a minimum. It was, one felt, an accidental phase. The\r\nassassination of McKinley was an interruption of the normal Washington\r\nprocess. To this place, out of the way of everywhere, come the senators\r\nand congressmen, mostly leaving their families behind them in their\r\nstates of origin, and hither, too, are drawn a multitude of journalists\r\nand political agents and clerks, a crowd of underbred, mediocre men. For\r\nmost of them there is neither social nor intellectual life. The thought\r\nof America is far away, centred now in New York; the business and\r\neconomic development centres upon New York; apart from the President, it\r\nis in New York that one meets the people who matter, and the New York\r\natmosphere that grows and develops ideas and purposes. New York is the\r\nnatural capital of the United States, and would need to be the capital\r\nof any highly organised national system. Government from the district of\r\nColumbia is in itself the repudiation of any highly organised national\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nBut government from this ineffectual, inert place is only the most\r\nstriking outcome of that inflexible constitution the wrangling delegates\r\nof 1787-8 did at last produce out of a conflict of State jealousies.\r\nThey did their best to render centralisation or any coalescence of\r\nStates impossible and private property impregnable, and so far their\r\nwork has proved extraordinarily effective. Only a great access of\r\nintellectual and moral vigour in the nation can ever set it aside. And\r\nwhile the more and more sterile millions of the United States grapple\r\nwith the legal and traditional difficulties that promise at last to\r\narrest their development altogether, the rest of the world will be\r\nmoving on to new phases. An awakened Asia will be reorganising its\r\nsocial and political conceptions in the light of modern knowledge and\r\nmodern ideas, and South America will be working out its destinies,\r\nperhaps in the form of a powerful confederation of states. All Europe\r\nwill be schooling its John Smiths to finer discipline and broader ideas.\r\nIt is quite possible that the American John Smiths may have little to\r\nbrag about in the way of national predominance by A.D. 2000. It is quite\r\npossible that the United States may be sitting meekly at the feet of at\r\npresent unanticipated teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POSSIBLE COLLAPSE OF CIVILISATION\r\n\r\n(_New Year, 1909_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Editor of the _New York World_ has asked me to guess the general\r\ntrend of events in the next thirty years or so with especial reference\r\nto the outlook for the State and City of New York. I like and rarely\r\nrefuse such cheerful invitations to prophesy. I have already made a sort\r\nof forecast (in my \"Anticipations\") of what may happen if the social and\r\neconomic process goes on fairly smoothly for all that time, and shown a\r\nNew York relieved from its present congestion by the development of the\r\nmeans of communication, and growing and spreading in wide and splendid\r\nsuburbs towards Boston and Philadelphia. I made that forecast before\r\never I passed Sandy Hook, but my recent visit only enhanced my sense of\r\ngrowth and \"go\" in things American. Still, we are nowadays all too apt\r\nto think that growth is inevitable and progress in the nature of things;\r\nthe Wonderful Century, as Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace called the\r\nnineteenth, has made us perhaps over-confident and forgetful of the\r\nruins of great cities and confident prides of the past that litter the\r\nworld, and here I will write about the other alternative, of the\r\nprogressive process \"hitting something,\" and smashing.\r\n\r\nThere are two chief things in modern life that impress me as dangerous\r\nand incalculable. The first of these is the modern currency and\r\nfinancial system, and the second is the chance we take of destructive\r\nwar. Let me dwell first of all on the mysterious possibilities of the\r\nformer, and then point out one or two uneasy developments of the latter.\r\n\r\nNow, there is nothing scientific about our currency and finance at all.\r\nIt is a thing that has grown up and elaborated itself out of very simple\r\nbeginnings in the course of a century or so. Three hundred years ago the\r\nedifice had hardly begun to rise from the ground, most property was\r\nreal, most people lived directly on the land, most business was on a\r\ncash basis, oversea trade was a proportionately small affair, labour was\r\nlocally fixed. Most of the world was at the level at which much of China\r\nremains to-day--able to get along without even coinage. It was a\r\nrudimentary world from the point of view of the modern financier and\r\nindustrial organiser. Well, on that rude, secure basis there has now\r\nbeen piled the most chancy and insecurely experimental system of\r\nconventions and assumptions about money and credit it is possible to\r\nimagine. There has grown up a vast system of lending and borrowing, a\r\nworld-wide extension of joint-stock enterprises that involve at last the\r\nmost fantastic relationships. I find myself, for example, owning\r\n(partially, at least) a bank in New Zealand, a railway in Cuba, another\r\nin Canada, several in Brazil, an electric power plant in the City of\r\nWestminster, and so on, and I use these stocks and shares as a sort of\r\ninterest-bearing money. If I want money to spend, I sell a railway share\r\nmuch as one might change a hundred-pound banknote; if I have more cash\r\nthan I need immediately I buy a few shares. I perceive that the value of\r\nthese shares oscillates, sometimes rather gravely, and that the value of\r\nthe alleged money on the cheques I get also oscillates as compared with\r\nthe things I want to buy; that, indeed, the whole system (which has only\r\nexisted for a couple of centuries or so, and which keeps on getting\r\nhigher and giddier) is perpetually swaying and quivering and bending and\r\nsagging; but it is only when such a great crisis occurs as that of 1907\r\nthat it enters my mind that possibly there is no limit to these\r\noscillations, that possibly the whole vast accidental edifice will\r\npresently come smashing down.\r\n\r\nWhy shouldn't it?\r\n\r\nI defy any economist or financial expert to prove that it cannot. That\r\nit hasn't done so in the little time for which it has existed is no\r\nreply at all. It is like arguing that a man cannot die because he has\r\nnever been known to do so. Previous men have died, previous\r\ncivilisations have collapsed, if not of acute, then of chronic financial\r\ndisorders.\r\n\r\nThe experience of 1907 indicated very clearly how a collapse might\r\noccur. A panic, like an avalanche, is a thing much easier to start than\r\nstop. Previous panics have been arrested by good luck; this last one in\r\nAmerica, for example, found Europe strong and prosperous and helpful. In\r\nevery panic period there is a huge dislocation of business enterprises,\r\nvast multitudes of men are thrown out of employment, there is grave\r\nsocial and political disorder; but in the end, so far, things have an\r\nair of having recovered. But now, suppose the panic wave a little more\r\nuniversal--and panic waves tend to be more extensive than they used to\r\nbe. Suppose that when securities fall all round, and gold appreciates in\r\nNew York, and frightened people begin to sell investments and hoard\r\ngold, the same thing happens in other parts of the world. Increase the\r\nscale of the trouble only two or three times, and would our system\r\nrecover? Imagine great masses of men coming out of employment, and angry\r\nand savage, in all our great towns; imagine the railways working with\r\nreduced staffs on reduced salaries or blocked by strikers; imagine\r\nprovision dealers stopping consignments to retailers, and retailers\r\nhesitating to give credit. A phase would arrive when the police and\r\nmilitia keeping order in the streets would find themselves on short\r\nrations and without their weekly pay.\r\n\r\nWhat we moderns, with our little three hundred years or so of security,\r\ndo not recognise is that things that go up and down may, given a certain\r\ncombination of chances, go down steadily, down and down.\r\n\r\nWhat would you do, dear reader--what should I do--if a slump went on\r\ncontinually?\r\n\r\nAnd that brings me to the second great danger to our modern\r\ncivilisation, and that is War. We have over-developed war. While we have\r\nleft our peace organisation to the niggling, slow, self-seeking methods\r\nof private enterprise; while we have left the breeding of our peoples to\r\nchance, their minds to the halfpenny press and their wealth to the drug\r\nmanufacturer, we have pushed forward the art of war on severely\r\nscientific and Socialist lines; we have put all the collective resources\r\nof the community and an enormous proportion of its intelligence and\r\ninvention ungrudgingly into the improvement and manufacture of the\r\napparatus of destruction. Great Britain, for example, is content with\r\nthe railways and fireplaces and types of housing she had fifty years\r\nago; she still uses telephones and the electric light in the most\r\ntentative spirit; but every ironclad she had five-and-twenty years ago\r\nis old iron now and abandoned. Everything crawls forward but the science\r\nof war; that rushes on. Of what will happen if presently the guns begin\r\nto go off I have no shadow of doubt. Every year has seen the\r\ndisproportionate increase until now. Every modern European state is more\r\nor less like a cranky, ill-built steamboat in which some idiot has\r\nmounted and loaded a monstrous gun with no apparatus to damp its recoil.\r\nWhether that gun hits or misses when it is fired, of one thing we may be\r\nabsolutely certain--it will send the steamboat to the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nModern warfare is an insanity, not a sane business proposition. Its\r\npreparation eats more and more into the resources which should be\r\nfurnishing a developing civilisation; its possibilities of destruction\r\nare incalculable. A new epoch has opened with the coming of the\r\nnavigable balloon and the flying machine. To begin with, these things\r\nopen new gulfs for expenditure; in the end they mean possibilities of\r\ndestruction beyond all precedent. Such things as the _Zeppelin_ and the\r\n_Ville de Paris_ are only the first pigmy essays of the aeronaut. It is\r\nclear that to be effective, capable of carrying guns and comparatively\r\ninsensitive to perforation by shot and shell, these things will have to\r\nbe very much larger and as costly, perhaps, as a first-class cruiser.\r\nImagine such monsters of the air, and wild financial panic below!\r\n\r\nHere, then, are two associated possibilities with which to modify our\r\nexpectation of an America advancing steadily on the road to an organised\r\ncivilisation, of New York rebuilding herself in marble, spreading like a\r\ngarden city over New Jersey and Long Island and New York State, becoming\r\na new and greater Venice, queen of the earth.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, after all, the twentieth century isn't going to be so\r\nprosperous as the nineteenth. Perhaps, instead of going resistlessly\r\nonward, we are going to have a set-back. Perhaps we are going to be put\r\nback to learn over again under simpler conditions some of those\r\nnecessary fundamental lessons our race has learnt as yet insufficiently\r\nwell--honesty and brotherhood, social collectivism, and the need of some\r\ncommon peace-preserving council for the whole world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IDEAL CITIZEN\r\n\r\n\r\nOur conceptions of what a good citizen should be are all at sixes and\r\nsevens. No two people will be found to agree in every particular of such\r\nan ideal, and the extreme divergences upon what is necessary, what is\r\npermissible, what is unforgivable in him, will span nearly the whole\r\nrange of human possibility and conduct. As a consequence, we bring up\r\nour children in a mist of vague intimations, in a confusion of warring\r\nvoices, perplexed as to what they must do, uncertain as to what they may\r\ndo, doomed to lives of compromise and fluctuating and inoperative\r\nopinion. Ideals and suggestions come and go before their eyes like\r\nfigures in a fog. The commonest pattern, perhaps--the commonest pattern\r\ncertainly in Sunday schools and edifying books, and on all those places\r\nand occasions when morality is sought as an end--is a clean and\r\nable-bodied person, truthful to the extent that he does not tell lies,\r\ntemperate so far as abstinence is concerned, honest without pedantry,\r\nand active in his own affairs, steadfastly law-abiding and respectful to\r\ncustom and usage, though aloof from the tumult of politics, brave but\r\nnot adventurous, punctual in some form of religious exercise, devoted to\r\nhis wife and children, and kind without extravagance to all men.\r\nEveryone feels that this is not enough, everyone feels that something\r\nmore is wanted and something different; most people are a little\r\ninterested in what that difference can be, and it is a business that\r\nmuch of what is more than trivial in our art, our literature and our\r\ndrama must do to fill in bit by bit and shade by shade the subtle, the\r\npermanent detail of the answer.\r\n\r\nIt does very greatly help in this question to bear in mind the conflict\r\nof our origins. Every age is an age of transition, of minglings, of the\r\nbreaking up of old, narrow cultures, and the breaking down of barriers,\r\nof spiritual and often of actual interbreeding. Not only is the physical\r\nbut the moral and intellectual ancestry of everyone more mixed than ever\r\nit was before. We blend in our blood, everyone of us, and we blend in\r\nour ideas and purposes, craftsmen, warriors, savages, peasants, and a\r\nscore of races, and an endless multitude of social expedients and rules.\r\nGo back but a hundred generations in the lineage of the most delicate\r\ngirl you know, and you will find a dozen murderers. You will find liars\r\nand cheats, lascivious sinners, women who have sold themselves, slaves,\r\nimbeciles, devotees, saints, men of fantastic courage, discreet and\r\nwatchful persons, usurers, savages, criminals and kings, and every one\r\nof this miscellany, not simply fathering or mothering on the way to her,\r\nbut teaching urgently and with every grade of intensity, views and\r\nhabits for which they stand. Something of it all has come to her, albeit\r\nmuch may seem forgotten. In every human birth, with a new little\r\nvariation, a fresh slight novelty of arrangement the old issues rise\r\nagain. Our ideas, even more than our blood, flow from multitudinous\r\nsources.\r\n\r\nCertain groups of ideas come to us distinctively associated with certain\r\nmarked ways of life. Many, and for a majority of us, it may be, most of\r\nour ancestors were serfs or slaves. And men and women who have had,\r\ngeneration after generation, to adapt themselves to slavery and the rule\r\nof a master, develop an idea of goodness very different from that of\r\nprinces. From our slave ancestry, says Lester Ward, we learnt to work,\r\nand certainly it is from slavery we derive the conception that industry,\r\neven though it be purposeless industry, is a virtue in itself. The good\r\nslave, too, has a morality of restraints; he abstains from the food he\r\nhandles and hungers for, and he denies himself pride and initiative of\r\nevery sort. He is honest in not taking, but he is unscrupulous about\r\nadequate service. He makes no virtue of frankness, but much of kindly\r\nhelpfulness and charity to the weak. He has no sense of duty in planning\r\nor economising. He is polite and soft-spoken, and disposed to irony\r\nrather than denunciation, ready to admire cuteness and condone\r\ndeception. Not so the rebel. That tradition is working in us also. It\r\nhas been the lot of vast masses of population in every age to be living\r\nin successful or unsuccessful resistance to mastery, to be dreading\r\noppression or to be just escaped from it. Resentment becomes a virtue\r\nthen, and any peace with the oppressor a crime. It is from rebel origins\r\nso many of us get the idea that disrespectfulness is something of a duty\r\nand obstinacy a fine thing. And under the force of this tradition we\r\nidealise the rugged and unmanageable, we find something heroic in rough\r\nclothes and hands, in bad manners, insensitive behaviour, and\r\nunsociableness. And a community of settlers, again, in a rough country,\r\nfighting for a bare existence, makes a virtue of vehemence, of a hasty\r\nrapidity of execution. Hurried and driven men glorify \"push\" and\r\nimpatience, and despise finish and fine discriminations as weak and\r\ndemoralising things. These three, the Serf, the Rebel, and the\r\nSquatter, are three out of a thousand types and aspects that have gone\r\nto our making. In the American composition they are dominant. But all\r\nthose thousand different standards and traditions are our material, each\r\nwith something fine, and each with something evil. They have all\r\nprovided the atmosphere of upbringing for men in the past. Out of them\r\nand out of unprecedented occasions, we in this newer age, in which there\r\nare no slaves, in which every man is a citizen, in which the\r\nconveniences of a great and growing civilisation makes the frantic\r\navidity of the squatter a nuisance, have to set ourselves to frame the\r\nstandard of our children's children, to abandon what the slave or the\r\nsquatter or the rebel found necessary and that we find unnecessary, to\r\nfit fresh requirements to our new needs. So we have to develop our\r\nfigure of the fine man, our desirable citizen in that great and noble\r\ncivilised state we who have a \"sense of the state\" would build out of\r\nthe confusions of our world.\r\n\r\nTo describe that ideal modern citizen now is at best to make a guess and\r\na suggestion of what must be built in reality by the efforts of a\r\nthousand minds. But he will be a very different creature from that\r\nindifferent, well-behaved business man who passes for a good citizen\r\nto-day. He will be neither under the slave tradition nor a rebel nor a\r\nvehement elemental man. Essentially he will be aristocratic,\r\naristocratic not in the sense that he has slaves or class inferiors,\r\nbecause probably he will have nothing of the sort, but aristocratic in\r\nthe sense that he will feel the State belongs to him and he to the\r\nState. He will probably be a public servant; at any rate, he will be a\r\nman doing some work in the complicated machinery of the modern community\r\nfor a salary and not for speculative gain. Typically, he will be a\r\nprofessional man. I do not think the ideal modern citizen can be a\r\nperson living chiefly by buying for as little as he can give and selling\r\nfor as much as he can get; indeed, most of what we idolise to-day as\r\nbusiness enterprise I think he will regard with considerable contempt.\r\nBut, then, I am a Socialist, and look forward to the time when the\r\neconomic machinery of the community will be a field not for private\r\nenrichment but for public service.\r\n\r\nHe will be good to his wife and children as he will be good to his\r\nfriend, but he will be no partisan for wife and family against the\r\ncommon welfare. His solicitude will be for the welfare of all the\r\nchildren of the community; he will have got beyond blind instinct; he\r\nwill have the intelligence to understand that almost any child in the\r\nworld may have as large a share as his own offspring in the parentage of\r\nhis great-great-grandchildren His wife he will treat as his equal; he\r\nwill not be \"kind\" to her, but fair and frank and loving, as one equal\r\nshould be with another; he will no more have the impertinence to pet and\r\npamper her, to keep painful and laborious things out of her knowledge to\r\n\"shield\" her from the responsibility of political and social work, than\r\nhe will to make a Chinese toy of her and bind her feet. He and she will\r\nlove that they may enlarge and not limit one another.\r\n\r\nConsciously and deliberately the ideal citizen will seek beauty in\r\nhimself and in his way of living. He will be temperate rather than\r\nharshly abstinent, and he will keep himself fit and in training as an\r\nelementary duty. He will not be a fat or emaciated person. Fat, panting\r\nmen, and thin, enfeebled ones cannot possibly be considered good\r\ncitizens any more than dirty or verminous people. He will be just as\r\nfine and seemly in his person as he can be, not from vanity and\r\nself-assertion but to be pleasing and agreeable to his fellows. The ugly\r\ndress and ugly bearing of the \"good man\" of to-day will be as\r\nincomprehensible to him as the filth of a palaeolithic savage is to us.\r\nHe will not speak of his \"frame,\" and hang clothes like sacks over it;\r\nhe will know and feel that he and the people about him have wonderful,\r\ndelightful and beautiful bodies.\r\n\r\nAnd--I speak of the ideal common citizen--he will be a student and a\r\nphilosopher. To understand will be one of his necessary duties. His\r\nmind, like his body, will be fit and well clothed. He will not be too\r\nbusy to read and think, though he may be too busy to rush about to get\r\nignorantly and blatantly rich. It follows that, since he will have a\r\nmind exercised finely and flexible and alert, he will not be a secretive\r\nman. Secretiveness and secret planning are vulgarity; men and women need\r\nto be educated, and he will be educated out of these vices. He will be\r\nintensely truthful, not simply in the vulgar sense of not misstating\r\nfacts when pressed, but truthful in the manner of the scientific man or\r\nthe artist, and as scornful of concealment as they; truthful, that is to\r\nsay, as the expression of a ruling desire to have things made plain and\r\nclear, because that so they are most beautiful and life is at its\r\nfinest....\r\n\r\nAnd all that I have written of him is equally true and applies word for\r\nword, with only such changes of gender as are needed, to the woman\r\ncitizen also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME POSSIBLE DISCOVERIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present time is harvest home for the prophets. The happy speculator\r\nin future sits on the piled-up wain, singing \"I told you so,\" with the\r\nsubmarine and the flying machine and the Marconigram and the North Pole\r\nsuccessfully achieved. In the tumult of realisations it perhaps escapes\r\nattention that the prophetic output of new hopes is by no means keeping\r\npace with the crop of consummations. The present trend of scientific\r\ndevelopment is not nearly so obvious as it was a score of years ago; its\r\npromises lack the elementary breadth of that simpler time. Once you have\r\nflown, you have flown. Once you have steamed about under water, you have\r\nsteamed about under water. There seem no more big things of that kind\r\navailable--so that I almost regret the precipitance of Commander Peary\r\nand Captain Amundsen. No one expects to go beyond that atmosphere for\r\nsome centuries at least; all the elements are now invaded. Conceivably\r\nman may presently contrive some sort of earthworm apparatus, so that he\r\ncould go through the rocks prospecting very much as an earthworm goes\r\nthrough the soil, excavating in front and dumping behind, but, to put it\r\nmoderately, there are considerable difficulties. And I doubt the\r\nimaginative effect. On the whole, I think material science has got\r\nsamples now of all its crops at this level, and that what lies before it\r\nin the coming years is chiefly to work them out in detail and realise\r\nthem on the larger scale. No doubt science will still yield all sorts\r\nof big surprising effects, but nothing, I think, to equal the dramatic\r\nnovelty, the demonstration of man having got to something altogether new\r\nand strange, of Montgolfier, or the Wright Brothers, of Columbus, or the\r\nPolar conquest. There remains, of course, the tapping of atomic energy,\r\nbut I give two hundred years yet before that....\r\n\r\nSo far, then, as mechanical science goes I am inclined to think the\r\ncoming period will be, from the point of view of the common man, almost\r\nwithout sensational interest. There will be an immense amount of\r\nenrichment and filling-in, but of the sort that does not get prominently\r\ninto the daily papers. At every point there will be economies and\r\nsimplifications of method, discoveries of new artificial substances with\r\nnew capabilities, and of new methods of utilising power. There will be a\r\nprogressive change in the apparatus and quality of human life--the sort\r\nof alteration of the percentages that causes no intellectual shock.\r\nElectric heating, for example, will become practicable in our houses,\r\nand then cheaper, and at last so cheap and good that nobody will burn\r\ncoal any more. Little electric contrivances will dispense with menial\r\nservice in more and more directions. The builder will introduce new,\r\nmore convenient, healthier and prettier substances, and the young\r\narchitect will become increasingly the intelligent student of novelty.\r\nThe steam engine, the coal yard, and the tail chimney, and indeed all\r\nchimneys, will vanish quietly from our urban landscape. The speeding up\r\nand cheapening of travel, and the increase in its swiftness and comfort\r\nwill go on steadily--widening experience. A more systematic and\r\nunderstanding social science will be estimating the probable growth and\r\nmovement of population, and planning town and country on lines that\r\nwould seem to-day almost inconceivably wise and generous. All this means\r\na quiet broadening and aeration and beautifying of life. Utopian\r\nrequirements, so far as the material side of things goes, will be\r\nexecuted and delivered with at last the utmost promptness....\r\n\r\nIt is in quite other directions that the scientific achievements to\r\nastonish our children will probably be achieved. Progress never appears\r\nto be uniform in human affairs. There are intricate correlations between\r\ndepartment and department. One field must mark time until another can\r\ncome up to it with results sufficiently arranged and conclusions\r\nsufficiently simplified for application Medicine waits on organic\r\nchemistry, geology on mineralogy, and both on the chemistry of high\r\npressures and temperature. And subtle variations in method and the\r\nprevailing mental temperament of the type of writer engaged, produce\r\nremarkable differences in the quality and quantity of the stated result.\r\nMoreover, there are in the history of every scientific province periods\r\nof seed-time, when there is great activity without immediate apparent\r\nfruition, and periods, as, for example, the last two decades of\r\nelectrical application, of prolific realisation. It is highly probable\r\nthat the physiologist and the organic chemist are working towards\r\nco-operations that may make the physician's sphere the new scientific\r\nwonderland.\r\n\r\nAt present dietary and regimen are the happy hunting ground of the quack\r\nand that sort of volunteer specialist, half-expert, half-impostor, who\r\nflourishes in the absence of worked out and definite knowledge. The\r\ngeneral mass of the medical profession, equipped with a little\r\nexperience and a muddled training, and preposterously impeded by the\r\nprivate adventure conditions under which it lives, goes about pretending\r\nto the possession of precise knowledge which simply does not exist in\r\nthe world. Medical research is under-endowed and stupidly endowed, not\r\nfor systematic scientific inquiry so much as for the unscientific\r\nseeking of remedies for specific evils--for cancer, consumption, and the\r\nlike. Yet masked, misrepresented limited and hampered, the work of\r\nestablishing a sound science of vital processes in health and disease is\r\nprobably going on now, similar to the clarification of physics and\r\nchemistry that went on in the later part of the eighteenth and the early\r\nyears of the nineteenth centuries. It is not unreasonable to suppose\r\nthat medicine may presently arrive at far-reaching generalised\r\nconvictions, and proceed to take over this great hinterland of human\r\ninterests which legitimately belongs to it.\r\n\r\nBut medicine is not the only field to which we may reasonably look for a\r\nsudden development of wonders. Compared with the sciences of matter,\r\npsychology and social science have as yet given the world remarkably\r\nlittle cause for amazement. Not only is our medicine feeble and\r\nfragmentary, but our educational science is the poorest miscellany of\r\naphorisms and dodges. Indeed, directly one goes beyond the range of\r\nmeasurement and weighing and classification, one finds a sort of\r\nunprogressive floundering going on, which throws the strongest doubts\r\nupon the practical applicability of the current logical and metaphysical\r\nconceptions in those fields. We have emerged only partially from the age\r\nof the schoolmen In these directions we have not emerged at all. It is\r\nquite possible that in university lecture rooms and forbidding volumes\r\nof metaphysical discussion a new emancipation of the human intellect and\r\nwill is even now going on. Presently men may be attacking the problems\r\nof the self-control of human life and of human destiny in new phrases\r\nand an altogether novel spirit.\r\n\r\nGuesses at the undiscovered must necessarily be vague, but my\r\nanticipations fall into two groups, and first I am disposed to expect a\r\ngreat systematic increment in individual human power. We probably have\r\nno suspicion as yet of what may be done with the human body and mind by\r\nway of enhancing its effectiveness I remember talking to the late Sir\r\nMichael Foster upon the possibilities of modern surgery, and how he\r\nconfessed that he did not dare for his reputation's sake tell ordinary\r\npeople the things he believed would some day become matter-of-fact\r\noperations. In that respect I think he spoke for very many of his\r\ncolleagues. It is already possible to remove almost any portion of the\r\nhuman body, including, if needful, large sections of the brain; it is\r\npossible to graft living flesh on living flesh, make new connections,\r\nmould, displace, and rearrange. It is also not impossible to provoke\r\nlocal hypertrophy, and not only by knife and physical treatment but by\r\nthe subtler methods of hypnotism, profound changes can be wrought in the\r\nessential structure of a human being. If only our knowledge of function\r\nand value were at all adequate, we could correct and develop ourselves\r\nin the most extraordinary way. Our knowledge is not adequate, but it may\r\nnot always remain inadequate.\r\n\r\nWe have already had some very astonishing suggestions in this direction\r\nfrom Doctor Metchnikoff. He regards the human stomach and large\r\nintestine as not only vestigial and superfluous in the human economy,\r\nbut as positively dangerous on account of the harbour they afford for\r\nthose bacteria that accelerate the decay of age. He proposes that these\r\nviscera should be removed. To a layman like myself this is an altogether\r\nastounding and horrifying idea, but Doctor Metchnikoff is a man of the\r\nvery greatest scientific reputation, and it does not give him any qualm\r\nof horror or absurdity to advance it. I am quite sure that if a\r\ngentleman called upon me \"done up\" in the way I am dimly suggesting,\r\nwith most of the contents of his abdomen excavated, his lungs and heart\r\nprobably enlarged and improved, parts of his brain removed to eliminate\r\nharmful tendencies and make room for the expansion of the remainder, his\r\nmind and sensibilities increased, and his liability to fatigue and the\r\nneed of sleep abolished, I should conceal with the utmost difficulty my\r\ninexpressible disgust and terror. But, then, if M. Bl\u00e9riot, with his\r\nflying machine, ear-flaps and goggles, had soared down in the year 54\r\nB.C., let us say, upon my woad-adorned ancestors--every family man in\r\nBritain was my ancestor in those days--at Dover, they would have had\r\nentirely similar emotions. And at present I am not discussing what is\r\nbeautiful in humanity, but what is possible--and what, being possible,\r\nis likely to be attempted.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow that because men will some day have this enormous\r\npower over themselves, physically and mentally, that they will\r\nnecessarily make themselves horrible--even by our present standards\r\nquite a lot of us would be all the slenderer and more active and\r\ngraceful for \"Metchnikoffing\"--nor does surgery exhaust the available\r\nmethods. We are still in the barbaric age, so far as our use of food and\r\ndrugs is concerned. We stuff all sorts of substances into our\r\nunfortunate interiors and blunder upon the most various consequences.\r\nFew people of three score and ten but have spent in the aggregate the\r\nbest part of a year in a state of indigestion, stupid, angry or painful\r\nindigestion as the case may be. No one would be so careless and ignorant\r\nabout the fuel he burnt in his motor-car as most of us are about the\r\nfuel we burn in our bodies. And there are all sort of stimulating and\r\nexhilarating things, digesting things, fatigue-suppressing things,\r\nexercise economising things, we dare not use because we are afraid of\r\nour ignorance of their precise working. There seems no reason to suppose\r\nthat human life, properly understood and controlled, could not be a\r\nconstant succession of delightful and for the most part active bodily\r\nand mental phases. It is sheer ignorance and bad management that keep\r\nthe majority of people in that disagreeable system of states which we\r\nindicate by saying we are \"a bit off colour\" or a little \"out of\r\ntraining.\" It may seem madly Utopian now to suggest that practically\r\neveryone in the community might be clean, beautiful, incessantly active,\r\n\"fit,\" and long-lived, with the marks of all the surgery they have\r\nundergone quite healed and hidden, but not more madly Utopian than it\r\nwould have seemed to King Alfred the Great if one had said that\r\npractically everyone in this country, down to the very swineherds,\r\nshould be able to read and write.\r\n\r\nMetchnikoff has speculated upon the possibility of delaying old age, and\r\nI do not see why his method should not be applied to the diurnal need of\r\nsleep. No vital process seems to be absolutely fated in itself; it is a\r\nthing conditioned and capable of modification. If Metchnikoff is\r\nright--and to a certain extent he must be right--the decay of age is due\r\nto changing organic processes that may be checked and delayed and\r\nmodified by suitable food and regimen. He holds out hope of a new phase\r\nin the human cycle, after the phase of struggle and passion, a phase of\r\nserene intellectual activity, old age with all its experience and none\r\nof its infirmities. Still more are fatigue and the need for repose\r\ndependent upon chemical changes in the body. It would seem we are unable\r\nto maintain exertion, partly through the exhaustion of our tissues, but\r\nfar more by the loading of our blood with fatigue products--a\r\nrecuperative interlude must ensue. But there is no reason to suppose\r\nthat the usual food of to-day is the most rapidly assimilable nurture\r\npossible, that a rapidly digestible or injectable substance is not\r\nconceivable that would vastly accelerate repair, nor that the\r\nelimination and neutralisation of fatigue products might not also be\r\nenormously hastened. There is no inherent impossibility in the idea not\r\nonly of various glands being induced to function in a modified manner,\r\nbut even in the insertion upon the circulation of interceptors and\r\nartificial glandular structures. No doubt that may strike even an\r\nadventurous surgeon as chimerical, but consider what people, even\r\nauthoritative people, were saying of flying and electric traction twenty\r\nyears ago. At present a man probably does not get more than three or\r\nfour hours of maximum mental and physical efficiency in the day. Few men\r\ncan keep at their best in either physical or intellectual work for so\r\nlong as that. The rest of the time goes in feeding, digesting, sleeping,\r\nsitting about, relaxation of various kinds. It is quite possible that\r\nscience may set itself presently to extend systematically that\r\nproportion of efficient time. The area of maximum efficiency may invade\r\nthe periods now demanded by digestion, sleep, exercise, so that at last\r\nnearly the whole of a man's twenty-four hours will be concentrated on\r\nhis primary interests instead of dispersed among these secondary\r\nnecessary matters.\r\n\r\nPlease understand I do not consider this concentration of activity and\r\nthese vast \"artificialisations\" of the human body as attractive or\r\ndesirable things. At the first proposal much of this tampering with the\r\nnatural stuff of life will strike anyone, I think, as ugly and horrible,\r\njust as seeing a little child, green-white and still under an\r\nanaesthetic, gripped my heart much more dreadfully than the sight of the\r\nsame child actively bawling with pain. But the business of this paper is\r\nto discuss things that may happen, and not to evolve dreams of\r\nloveliness. Perhaps things of this kind will be manageable without\r\ndreadfulness. Perhaps man will come to such wisdom that neither the\r\nknife nor the drugs nor any of the powers which science thrusts into his\r\nhand will slay the beauty of life for him. Suppose we assume that he is\r\nnot such a fool as to let that happen, and that ultimately he will\r\nemerge triumphant with all these powers utilised and controlled.\r\n\r\nIt is not only that an amplifying science may give mankind happier\r\nbodies and far more active and eventful lives, but that psychology and\r\neducational and social science, reinforcing literature and working\r\nthrough literature and art, may dare to establish serenities in his\r\nsoul. For surely no one who has lived, no one who has watched sin and\r\ncrime and punishment, but must have come to realise the enormous amount\r\nof misbehaviour that is mere ignorance and want of mental scope. For my\r\nown part I have never believed in the devil. And it may be a greater\r\nundertaking but no more impossible to make ways to goodwill and a good\r\nheart in men than it is to tunnel mountains and dyke back the sea. The\r\nway that led from the darkness of the cave to the electric light is the\r\nway that will lead to light in the souls of men, that is to say, the way\r\nof free and fearless thinking, free and fearless experiment, organised\r\nexchange of thoughts and results, and patience and persistence and a\r\nsort of intellectual civility.\r\n\r\nAnd with the development of philosophical and scientific method that\r\nwill go on with this great increase in man's control over himself,\r\nanother issue that is now a mere pious aspiration above abysses of\r\nignorance and difficulty, will come to be a manageable matter. It has\r\nbeen the perpetual wonder of philosophers from Plato onward that men\r\nhave bred their dogs and horses and left any man or woman, however vile,\r\nfree to bear offspring in the next generation of men. Still that goes\r\non. Beautiful and wonderful people die childless and bury their treasure\r\nin the grave, and we rest content with a system of matrimony that seems\r\ndesigned to perpetuate mediocrity. A day will come when men will be in\r\npossession of knowledge and opportunity that will enable them to master\r\nthis position, and then certainly will it be assured that every\r\ngeneration shall be born better than was the one before it. And with\r\nthat the history of humanity will enter upon a new phase, a phase which\r\nwill be to our lives as daylight is to the dreaming of a child as yet\r\nunborn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUMAN ADVENTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nAlone among all the living things this globe has borne, man reckons with\r\ndestiny. All other living things obey the forces that created them; and\r\nwhen the mood of the power changes, submit themselves passively to\r\nextinction Man only looks upon those forces in the face, anticipates the\r\nexhaustion of Nature's kindliness, seeks weapons to defend himself. Last\r\nof the children of Saturn, he escapes their general doom. He\r\ndispossesses his begetter of all possibility of replacement, and grasps\r\nthe sceptre of the world. Before man the great and prevalent creatures\r\nfollowed one another processionally to extinction; the early monsters of\r\nthe ancient seas, the clumsy amphibians struggling breathless to the\r\nland, the reptiles, the theriomorpha and the dinosaurs, the bat-winged\r\nreptiles of the Mesozoic forests, the colossal grotesque first mammals,\r\nthe giant sloths, the mastodons and mammoths; it is as if some idle\r\ndreamer moulded them and broke them and cast them aside, until at last\r\ncomes man and seizes the creative wrist that would wipe him out of being\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing else in all the world that so turns against the powers\r\nthat have made it, unless it be man's follower fire. But fire is\r\nwitless; a little stream, a changing breeze can stop it. Man\r\ncircumvents. If fire were human it would build boats across the rivers\r\nand outmanoeuvre the wind. It would lie in wait in sheltered places,\r\nsmouldering, husbanding its fuel until the grass was yellow and the\r\nforests sere. But fire is a mere creature of man's; our world before his\r\ncoming knew nothing of it in any of its habitable places, never saw it\r\nexcept in the lightning flash or remotely on some volcanic coronet. Man\r\nbrought it into the commerce of life, a shining, resentful slave, to\r\nhound off the startled beasts from his sleeping-place and serve him like\r\na dog.\r\n\r\nSuppose that some enduring intelligence watched through the ages the\r\nsuccessions of life upon this planet, marked the spreading first of this\r\nspecies and then that, the conflicts, the adaptations, the\r\npredominances, the dyings away, and conceive how it would have witnessed\r\nthis strange dramatic emergence of a rare great ape to manhood. To such\r\na mind the creature would have seemed at first no more than one of\r\nseveral varieties of clambering frugivorous mammals, a little\r\ndistinguished by a disposition to help his clumsy walking with a stake\r\nand reinforce his fist with a stone. The foreground of the picture would\r\nhave been filled by the rhinoceros and mammoth, the great herds of\r\nruminants, the sabre-toothed lion and the big bears. Then presently the\r\nobserver would have noted a peculiar increasing handiness about the\r\nobscurer type, an unwonted intelligence growing behind its eyes. He\r\nwould have perceived a disposition in this creature no beast had shown\r\nbefore, a disposition to make itself independent of the conditions of\r\nclimate and the chances of the seasons. Did shelter fail among the trees\r\nand rocks, this curious new thing-began to make itself harbours of its\r\nown; was food irregular, it multiplied food. It began to spread out from\r\nits original circumstances, fitting itself to novel needs, leaving the\r\nforests, invading the plains, following the watercourses upward and\r\ndownward, presently carrying the smoke of its fires like a banner of\r\nconquest into wintry desolations and the high places of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe first onset of man must have been comparatively slow, the first\r\nadvances needed long ages. By small degrees it gathered pace. The stride\r\nfrom the scattered savagery of the earlier stone period to the first\r\ncities, historically a vast interval, would have seemed to that still\r\nwatcher, measuring by the standards of astronomy and the rise and\r\ndecline of races and genera and orders, a, step almost abrupt. It took,\r\nperhaps, a thousand generations or so to make it. In that interval man\r\npassed from an animal-like obedience to the climate and the weather and\r\nhis own instincts, from living in small family parties of a score or so\r\nover restricted areas of indulgent country, to permanent settlements, to\r\nthe life of tribal and national communities and the beginnings of\r\ncities. He had spread in that fragment of time over great areas of the\r\nearth's surface, and now he was adapting himself to the Arctic circle on\r\nthe one hand and to the life of the tropics on the other; he had\r\ninvented the plough and the ship, and subjugated most of the domestic\r\nanimals; he was beginning to think of the origin of the world and the\r\nmysteries of being. Writing had added its enduring records to oral\r\ntradition, and he was already making roads. Another five or six hundred\r\ngenerations at most bring him to ourselves. We sweep into the field of\r\nthat looker-on, the momentary incarnations of this sempiternal being,\r\nMan. And after us there comes--\r\n\r\nA curtain falls.\r\n\r\nThe time in which we, whose minds meet here in this writing, were born\r\nand live and die, would be to that imagined observer a mere instant's\r\nphase in the swarming liberation of our kind from ancient imperatives.\r\nIt would seem to him a phase of unprecedented swift change and expansion\r\nand achievement. In this last handful of years, electricity has ceased\r\nto be a curious toy, and now carries half mankind upon their daily\r\njourneys, it lights our cities till they outshine the moon and stars,\r\nand reduces to our service a score of hitherto unsuspected metals; we\r\nclamber to the pole of our globe, scale every mountain, soar into the\r\nair, learn how to overcome the malaria that barred our white races from\r\nthe tropics, and how to draw the sting from a hundred such agents of\r\ndeath. Our old cities are being rebuilt in towering marble; great new\r\ncities rise to vie with them. Never, it would seem, has man been so\r\nvarious and busy and persistent, and there is no intimation of any check\r\nto the expansion of his energies.\r\n\r\nAnd all this continually accelerated advance has come through the\r\nquickening and increase of man's intelligence and its reinforcement\r\nthrough speech and writing. All this has come in spite of fierce\r\ninstincts that make him the most combatant and destructive of animals,\r\nand in spite of the revenge Nature has attempted time after time for his\r\nrebellion against her routines, in the form of strange diseases and\r\nnearly universal pestilences. All this has come as a necessary\r\nconsequence of the first obscure gleaming of deliberate thought and\r\nreason through the veil of his animal being. To begin with, he did not\r\nknow what he was doing. He sought his more immediate satisfaction and\r\nsafety and security. He still apprehends imperfectly the change that\r\ncomes upon him. The illusion of separation that makes animal life, that\r\nis to say, passionate competing and breeding and dying, possible, the\r\nblinkers Nature has put upon us that we may clash against and sharpen\r\none another, still darken our eyes. We live not life as yet, but in\r\nmillions of separated lives, still unaware except in rare moods of\r\nillumination that we are more than those fellow beasts of ours who drop\r\noff from the tree of life and perish alone. It is only in the last three\r\nor four thousand years, and through weak and tentative methods of\r\nexpression, through clumsy cosmogonies and theologies, and with\r\nincalculable confusion and discoloration, that the human mind has felt\r\nits way towards its undying being in the race. Man still goes to war\r\nagainst himself, prepares fleets and armies and fortresses, like a\r\nsleep-walker who wounds himself, like some infatuated barbarian who\r\nhacks his own limbs with a knife.\r\n\r\nBut he awakens. The nightmares of empire and racial conflict and war,\r\nthe grotesques of trade jealousy and tariffs, the primordial dream-stuff\r\nof lewdness and jealousy and cruelty, pale before the daylight which\r\nfilters between his eyelids. In a little while we individuals will know\r\nourselves surely for corpuscles in his being, for thoughts that come\r\ntogether out of strange wanderings into the coherence of a waking mind.\r\nA few score generations ago all living things were in our ancestry. A\r\nfew score generations ahead, and all mankind will be in sober fact\r\ndescendants from our blood. In physical as in mental fact we separate\r\npersons, with all our difference and individuality, are but fragments,\r\nset apart for a little while in order that we may return to the general\r\nlife again with fresh experiences and fresh acquirements, as bees\r\nreturn with pollen and nourishment to the fellowship of the hive.\r\n\r\nAnd this Man, this wonderful child of old earth, who is ourselves in the\r\nmeasure of our hearts and minds, does but begin his adventure now.\r\nThrough all time henceforth he does but begin his adventure. This planet\r\nand its subjugation is but the dawn of his existence. In a little while\r\nhe will reach out to the other planets, and take that greater fire, the\r\nsun, into his service. He will bring his solvent intelligence to bear\r\nupon the riddles of his individual interaction, transmute jealousy and\r\nevery passion, control his own increase, select and breed for his\r\nembodiment a continually finer and stronger and wiser race. What none of\r\nus can think or will, save in a disconnected partiality, he will think\r\nand will collectively. Already some of us feel our merger with that\r\ngreater life. There come moments when the thing shines out upon our\r\nthoughts. Sometimes in the dark sleepless solitudes of night, one ceases\r\nto be so-and-so, one ceases to bear a proper name, forgets one's\r\nquarrels and vanities, forgives and understands one's enemies and\r\noneself, as one forgives and understands the quarrels of little\r\nchildren, knowing oneself indeed to be a being greater than one's\r\npersonal accidents, knowing oneself for Man on his planet, flying\r\nswiftly to unmeasured destinies through the starry stillnesses of space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK AN ENGLISHMAN LOOKS AT THE WORLD***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 11502-8.txt or 11502-8.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/1/1/5/0/11502\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\r\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\r\npage at https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\r\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\r\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\r\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\r\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\r\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\r\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\r\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\r\ndownload by the etext year.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06\r\n\r\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\r\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\r\n\r\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\r\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\r\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\r\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\r\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\r\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234\r\n\r\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689\r\n\r\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL\r\n\r\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\r\n",

She had trembled on\r\nthe verge of such a resolution before, but this time quite definitely\r\nshe made it. A crisis had been reached, and she was almost glad it had\r\nbeen reached. She made up her mind in the train home that it should be\r\na decisive crisis. It is for that reason that this novel begins with\r\nher there, and neither earlier nor later, for it is the history of this\r\ncrisis and its consequences that this novel has to tell.\r\n\r\nShe had a compartment to herself in the train from London to Morningside\r\nPark, and she sat with both her feet on the seat in an attitude that\r\nwould certainly have distressed her mother to see, and horrified her\r\ngrandmother beyond measure; she sat with her knees up to her chin and\r\nher hands clasped before them, and she was so lost in thought that\r\nshe discovered with a start, from a lettered lamp, that she was at\r\nMorningside Park, and thought she was moving out of the station, whereas\r\nshe was only moving in. \u201cLord!\u201d she said. She jumped up at once,\r\ncaught up a leather clutch containing notebooks, a fat text-book, and\r\na chocolate-and-yellow-covered pamphlet, and leaped neatly from the\r\ncarriage, only to discover that the train was slowing down and that she\r\nhad to traverse the full length of the platform past it again as the\r\nresult of her precipitation. \u201cSold again,\u201d she remarked. \u201cIdiot!\u201d She\r\nraged inwardly while she walked along with that air of self-contained\r\nserenity that is proper to a young lady of nearly two-and-twenty under\r\nthe eye of the world.\r\n\r\nShe walked down the station approach, past the neat, obtrusive offices\r\nof the coal merchant and the house agent, and so to the wicket-gate by\r\nthe butcher\u2019s shop that led to the field path to her home. Outside the\r\npost-office stood a no-hatted, blond young man in gray flannels, who was\r\nelaborately affixing a stamp to a letter. At the sight of her he became\r\nrigid and a singularly bright shade of pink. She made herself serenely\r\nunaware of his existence, though it may be it was his presence that sent\r\nher by the field detour instead of by the direct path up the Avenue.\r\n\r\n\u201cUmph!\u201d he said, and regarded his letter doubtfully before consigning it\r\nto the pillar-box. \u201cHere goes,\u201d he said. Then he hovered undecidedly for\r\nsome seconds with his hands in his pockets and his mouth puckered to a\r\nwhistle before he turned to go home by the Avenue.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica forgot him as soon as she was through the gate, and her\r\nface resumed its expression of stern preoccupation. \u201cIt\u2019s either now or\r\nnever,\u201d she said to herself....\r\n\r\nMorningside Park was a suburb that had not altogether, as people say,\r\ncome off. It consisted, like pre-Roman Gaul, of three parts. There was\r\nfirst the Avenue, which ran in a consciously elegant curve from the\r\nrailway station into an undeveloped wilderness of agriculture, with big,\r\nyellow brick villas on either side, and then there was the pavement, the\r\nlittle clump of shops about the post-office, and under the railway arch\r\nwas a congestion of workmen\u2019s dwellings. The road from Surbiton and\r\nEpsom ran under the arch, and, like a bright fungoid growth in the\r\nditch, there was now appearing a sort of fourth estate of little\r\nred-and-white rough-cast villas, with meretricious gables and very\r\nbrassy window-blinds. Behind the Avenue was a little hill, and an\r\niron-fenced path went over the crest of this to a stile under an\r\nelm-tree, and forked there, with one branch going back into the Avenue\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s either now or never,\u201d said Ann Veronica, again ascending this\r\nstile. \u201cMuch as I hate rows, I\u2019ve either got to make a stand or give in\r\naltogether.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe seated herself in a loose and easy attitude and surveyed the\r\nbacks of the Avenue houses; then her eyes wandered to where the new\r\nred-and-white villas peeped among the trees. She seemed to be making\r\nsome sort of inventory. \u201cYe Gods!\u201d she said at last. \u201cWHAT a place!\r\n\r\n\u201cStuffy isn\u2019t the word for it.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder what he takes me for?\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen presently she got down from the stile a certain note of internal\r\nconflict, a touch of doubt, had gone from her warm-tinted face. She had\r\nnow the clear and tranquil expression of one whose mind is made up. Her\r\nback had stiffened, and her hazel eyes looked steadfastly ahead.\r\n\r\nAs she approached the corner of the Avenue the blond, no-hatted man in\r\ngray flannels appeared. There was a certain air of forced fortuity in\r\nhis manner. He saluted awkwardly. \u201cHello, Vee!\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cHello, Teddy!\u201d she answered.\r\n\r\nHe hung vaguely for a moment as she passed.\r\n\r\nBut it was clear she was in no mood for Teddys. He realized that he was\r\ncommitted to the path across the fields, an uninteresting walk at the\r\nbest of times.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, dammit!\u201d he remarked, \u201cdammit!\u201d with great bitterness as he faced\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica Stanley was twenty-one and a half years old. She had black\r\nhair, fine eyebrows, and a clear complexion; and the forces that had\r\nmodelled her features had loved and lingered at their work and made them\r\nsubtle and fine. She was slender, and sometimes she seemed tall, and\r\nwalked and carried herself lightly and joyfully as one who commonly\r\nand habitually feels well, and sometimes she stooped a little and\r\nwas preoccupied. Her lips came together with an expression between\r\ncontentment and the faintest shadow of a smile, her manner was one of\r\nquiet reserve, and behind this mask she was wildly discontented and\r\neager for freedom and life.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to live. She was vehemently impatient--she did not clearly\r\nknow for what--to do, to be, to experience. And experience was slow in\r\ncoming. All the world about her seemed to be--how can one put it?--in\r\nwrappers, like a house when people leave it in the summer. The blinds\r\nwere all drawn, the sunlight kept out, one could not tell what\r\ncolors these gray swathings hid. She wanted to know. And there was no\r\nintimation whatever that the blinds would ever go up or the windows or\r\ndoors be opened, or the chandeliers, that seemed to promise such a blaze\r\nof fire, unveiled and furnished and lit. Dim souls flitted about her,\r\nnot only speaking but it would seem even thinking in undertones....\r\n\r\nDuring her school days, especially her earlier school days, the world\r\nhad been very explicit with her, telling her what to do, what not to do,\r\ngiving her lessons to learn and games to play and interests of the most\r\nsuitable and various kinds. Presently she woke up to the fact that there\r\nwas a considerable group of interests called being in love and getting\r\nmarried, with certain attractive and amusing subsidiary developments,\r\nsuch as flirtation and \u201cbeing interested\u201d in people of the opposite sex.\r\nShe approached this field with her usual liveliness of apprehension. But\r\nhere she met with a check. These interests her world promptly, through\r\nthe agency of schoolmistresses, older school-mates, her aunt, and a\r\nnumber of other responsible and authoritative people, assured her she\r\nmust on no account think about. Miss Moffatt, the history and moral\r\ninstruction mistress, was particularly explicit upon this score, and\r\nthey all agreed in indicating contempt and pity for girls whose minds\r\nran on such matters, and who betrayed it in their conversation or dress\r\nor bearing. It was, in fact, a group of interests quite unlike any\r\nother group, peculiar and special, and one to be thoroughly ashamed of.\r\nNevertheless, Ann Veronica found it a difficult matter not to think of\r\nthese things. However having a considerable amount of pride, she decided\r\nshe would disavow these undesirable topics and keep her mind away from\r\nthem just as far as she could, but it left her at the end of her school\r\ndays with that wrapped feeling I have described, and rather at loose\r\nends.\r\n\r\nThe world, she discovered, with these matters barred had no particular\r\nplace for her at all, nothing for her to do, except a functionless\r\nexistence varied by calls, tennis, selected novels, walks, and dusting\r\nin her father\u2019s house. She thought study would be better. She was a\r\nclever girl, the best of her year in the High School, and she made\r\na valiant fight for Somerville or Newnham but her father had met and\r\nargued with a Somerville girl at a friend\u2019s dinner-table and he thought\r\nthat sort of thing unsexed a woman. He said simply that he wanted her to\r\nlive at home. There was a certain amount of disputation, and meanwhile\r\nshe went on at school. They compromised at length on the science course\r\nat the Tredgold Women\u2019s College--she had already matriculated into\r\nLondon University from school--she came of age, and she bickered with\r\nher aunt for latch-key privileges on the strength of that and her season\r\nticket. Shamefaced curiosities began to come back into her mind, thinly\r\ndisguised as literature and art. She read voraciously, and presently,\r\nbecause of her aunt\u2019s censorship, she took to smuggling any books she\r\nthought might be prohibited instead of bringing them home openly, and\r\nshe went to the theatre whenever she could produce an acceptable friend\r\nto accompany her. She passed her general science examination with double\r\nhonors and specialized in science. She happened to have an acute sense\r\nof form and unusual mental lucidity, and she found in biology, and\r\nparticularly in comparative anatomy, a very considerable interest,\r\nalbeit the illumination it cast upon her personal life was not\r\naltogether direct. She dissected well, and in a year she found herself\r\nchafing at the limitations of the lady B. Sc. who retailed a store of\r\nfaded learning in the Tredgold laboratory. She had already realized that\r\nthis instructress was hopelessly wrong and foggy--it is the test of the\r\ngood comparative anatomist--upon the skull. She discovered a desire to\r\nenter as a student in the Imperial College at Westminster, where Russell\r\ntaught, and go on with her work at the fountain-head.\r\n\r\nShe had asked about that already, and her father had replied, evasively:\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to see about that, little Vee; we\u2019ll have to see about\r\nthat.\u201d In that posture of being seen about the matter hung until she\r\nseemed committed to another session at the Tredgold College, and in the\r\nmean time a small conflict arose and brought the latch-key question, and\r\nin fact the question of Ann Veronica\u2019s position generally, to an acute\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the various business men, solicitors, civil servants,\r\nand widow ladies who lived in the Morningside Park Avenue, there was a\r\ncertain family of alien sympathies and artistic quality, the Widgetts,\r\nwith which Ann Veronica had become very friendly. Mr. Widgett was a\r\njournalist and art critic, addicted to a greenish-gray tweed suit\r\nand \u201cart\u201d brown ties; he smoked corncob pipes in the Avenue on Sunday\r\nmorning, travelled third class to London by unusual trains, and openly\r\ndespised golf. He occupied one of the smaller houses near the station.\r\nHe had one son, who had been co-educated, and three daughters with\r\npeculiarly jolly red hair that Ann Veronica found adorable. Two of these\r\nhad been her particular intimates at the High School, and had done much\r\nto send her mind exploring beyond the limits of the available literature\r\nat home. It was a cheerful, irresponsible, shamelessly hard-up family in\r\nthe key of faded green and flattened purple, and the girls went on from\r\nthe High School to the Fadden Art School and a bright, eventful life of\r\nart student dances, Socialist meetings, theatre galleries, talking about\r\nwork, and even, at intervals, work; and ever and again they drew Ann\r\nVeronica from her sound persistent industry into the circle of these\r\nexperiences. They had asked her to come to the first of the two great\r\nannual Fadden Dances, the October one, and Ann Veronica had accepted\r\nwith enthusiasm. And now her father said she must not go.\r\n\r\nHe had \u201cput his foot down,\u201d and said she must not go.\r\n\r\nGoing involved two things that all Ann Veronica\u2019s tact had been\r\nineffectual to conceal from her aunt and father. Her usual dignified\r\nreserve had availed her nothing. One point was that she was to wear\r\nfancy dress in the likeness of a Corsair\u2019s bride, and the other was that\r\nshe was to spend whatever vestiges of the night remained after the dance\r\nwas over in London with the Widgett girls and a select party in \u201cquite a\r\ndecent little hotel\u201d near Fitzroy Square.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, my dear!\u201d said Ann Veronica\u2019s aunt.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d said Ann Veronica, with the air of one who shares a\r\ndifficulty, \u201cI\u2019ve promised to go. I didn\u2019t realize--I don\u2019t see how I\r\ncan get out of it now.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen it was her father issued his ultimatum. He had conveyed it to her,\r\nnot verbally, but by means of a letter, which seemed to her a singularly\r\nignoble method of prohibition. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t look me in the face and say\r\nit,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut of course it\u2019s aunt\u2019s doing really.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd thus it was that as Ann Veronica neared the gates of home, she said\r\nto herself: \u201cI\u2019ll have it out with him somehow. I\u2019ll have it out with\r\nhim. And if he won\u2019t--\u201d\r\n\r\nBut she did not give even unspoken words to the alternative at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3\r\n\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica\u2019s father was a solicitor with a good deal of company\r\nbusiness: a lean, trustworthy, worried-looking, neuralgic, clean-shaven\r\nman of fifty-three, with a hard mouth, a sharp nose, iron-gray hair,\r\ngray eyes, gold-framed glasses, and a small, circular baldness at the\r\ncrown of his head. His name was Peter. He had had five children at\r\nirregular intervals, of whom Ann Veronica was the youngest, so that as\r\na parent he came to her perhaps a little practised and jaded and\r\ninattentive; and he called her his \u201clittle Vee,\u201d and patted her\r\nunexpectedly and disconcertingly, and treated her promiscuously as of\r\nany age between eleven and eight-and-twenty. The City worried him a good\r\ndeal, and what energy he had left over he spent partly in golf, a game\r\nhe treated very seriously, and partly in the practices of microscopic\r\npetrography.\r\n\r\nHe \u201cwent in\u201d for microscopy in the unphilosophical Victorian manner as\r\nhis \u201chobby.\u201d A birthday present of a microscope had turned his mind to\r\ntechnical microscopy when he was eighteen, and a chance friendship with\r\na Holborn microscope dealer had confirmed that bent. He had remarkably\r\nskilful fingers and a love of detailed processes, and he had become one\r\nof the most dexterous amateur makers of rock sections in the world.\r\nHe spent a good deal more money and time than he could afford upon the\r\nlittle room at the top of the house, in producing new lapidary apparatus\r\nand new microscopic accessories and in rubbing down slices of rock to\r\na transparent thinness and mounting them in a beautiful and dignified\r\nmanner. He did it, he said, \u201cto distract his mind.\u201d His chief successes\r\nhe exhibited to the Lowndean Microscopical Society, where their high\r\ntechnical merit never failed to excite admiration. Their scientific\r\nvalue was less considerable, since he chose rocks entirely with a\r\nview to their difficulty of handling or their attractiveness at\r\nconversaziones when done. He had a great contempt for the sections the\r\n\u201ctheorizers\u201d produced. They proved all sorts of things perhaps, but they\r\nwere thick, unequal, pitiful pieces of work. Yet an indiscriminating,\r\nwrong-headed world gave such fellows all sorts of distinctions....\r\n\r\nHe read but little, and that chiefly healthy light fiction with\r\nchromatic titles, The Red Sword, The Black Helmet, The Purple Robe, also\r\nin order \u201cto distract his mind.\u201d He read it in winter in the evening\r\nafter dinner, and Ann Veronica associated it with a tendency to\r\nmonopolize the lamp, and to spread a very worn pair of dappled fawn-skin\r\nslippers across the fender. She wondered occasionally why his mind\r\nneeded so much distraction. His favorite newspaper was the Times, which\r\nhe began at breakfast in the morning often with manifest irritation, and\r\ncarried off to finish in the train, leaving no other paper at home.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to Ann Veronica once that she had known him when he was\r\nyounger, but day had followed day, and each had largely obliterated the\r\nimpression of its predecessor. But she certainly remembered that when\r\nshe was a little girl he sometimes wore tennis flannels, and also rode a\r\nbicycle very dexterously in through the gates to the front door. And\r\nin those days, too, he used to help her mother with her gardening, and\r\nhover about her while she stood on the ladder and hammered creepers to\r\nthe scullery wall.\r\n\r\nIt had been Ann Veronica\u2019s lot as the youngest child to live in a home\r\nthat became less animated and various as she grew up. Her mother had\r\ndied when she was thirteen, her two much older sisters had married\r\noff--one submissively, one insubordinately; her two brothers had gone\r\nout into the world well ahead of her, and so she had made what she could\r\nof her father. But he was not a father one could make much of.\r\n\r\nHis ideas about girls and women were of a sentimental and modest\r\nquality; they were creatures, he thought, either too bad for a modern\r\nvocabulary, and then frequently most undesirably desirable, or too pure\r\nand good for life. He made this simple classification of a large and\r\nvarious sex to the exclusion of all intermediate kinds; he held that\r\nthe two classes had to be kept apart even in thought and remote from one\r\nanother. Women are made like the potter\u2019s vessels--either for worship\r\nor contumely, and are withal fragile vessels. He had never wanted\r\ndaughters. Each time a daughter had been born to him he had concealed\r\nhis chagrin with great tenderness and effusion from his wife, and had\r\nsworn unwontedly and with passionate sincerity in the bathroom. He was\r\na manly man, free from any strong maternal strain, and he had loved his\r\ndark-eyed, dainty bright-colored, and active little wife with a real\r\nvein of passion in his sentiment. But he had always felt (he had never\r\nallowed himself to think of it) that the promptitude of their family\r\nwas a little indelicate of her, and in a sense an intrusion. He had,\r\nhowever, planned brilliant careers for his two sons, and, with a certain\r\nhuman amount of warping and delay, they were pursuing these. One was\r\nin the Indian Civil Service and one in the rapidly developing motor\r\nbusiness. The daughters, he had hoped, would be their mother\u2019s care.\r\n\r\nHe had no ideas about daughters. They happen to a man.\r\n\r\nOf course a little daughter is a delightful thing enough. It runs about\r\ngayly, it romps, it is bright and pretty, it has enormous quantities of\r\nsoft hair and more power of expressing affection than its brothers. It\r\nis a lovely little appendage to the mother who smiles over it, and it\r\ndoes things quaintly like her, gestures with her very gestures. It makes\r\nwonderful sentences that you can repeat in the City and are good\r\nenough for Punch. You call it a lot of nicknames--\u201cBabs\u201d and \u201cBibs\u201d and\r\n\u201cViddles\u201d and \u201cVee\u201d; you whack at it playfully, and it whacks you back.\r\nIt loves to sit on your knee. All that is jolly and as it should be.\r\n\r\nBut a little daughter is one thing and a daughter quite another. There\r\none comes to a relationship that Mr. Stanley had never thought out.\r\nWhen he found himself thinking about it, it upset him so that he at once\r\nresorted to distraction. The chromatic fiction with which he relieved\r\nhis mind glanced but slightly at this aspect of life, and never with any\r\nquality of guidance. Its heroes never had daughters, they borrowed other\r\npeople\u2019s. The one fault, indeed, of this school of fiction for him was\r\nthat it had rather a light way with parental rights. His instinct was in\r\nthe direction of considering his daughters his absolute property, bound\r\nto obey him, his to give away or his to keep to be a comfort in his\r\ndeclining years just as he thought fit. About this conception of\r\nownership he perceived and desired a certain sentimental glamour, he\r\nliked everything properly dressed, but it remained ownership. Ownership\r\nseemed only a reasonable return for the cares and expenses of a\r\ndaughter\u2019s upbringing. Daughters were not like sons. He perceived,\r\nhowever, that both the novels he read and the world he lived in\r\ndiscountenanced these assumptions. Nothing else was put in their place,\r\nand they remained sotto voce, as it were, in his mind. The new and\r\nthe old cancelled out; his daughters became quasi-independent\r\ndependents--which is absurd. One married as he wished and one against\r\nhis wishes, and now here was Ann Veronica, his little Vee, discontented\r\nwith her beautiful, safe, and sheltering home, going about with hatless\r\nfriends to Socialist meetings and art-class dances, and displaying a\r\ndisposition to carry her scientific ambitions to unwomanly lengths. She\r\nseemed to think he was merely the paymaster, handing over the means\r\nof her freedom. And now she insisted that she MUST leave the chastened\r\nsecurity of the Tredgold Women\u2019s College for Russell\u2019s unbridled\r\nclasses, and wanted to go to fancy dress dances in pirate costume and\r\nspend the residue of the night with Widgett\u2019s ramshackle girls in some\r\nindescribable hotel in Soho!\r\n\r\nHe had done his best not to think about her at all, but the situation\r\nand his sister had become altogether too urgent. He had finally put\r\naside The Lilac Sunbonnet, gone into his study, lit the gas fire, and\r\nwritten the letter that had brought these unsatisfactory relations to a\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 4\r\n\r\nMY DEAR VEE, he wrote.\r\n\r\nThese daughters! He gnawed his pen and reflected, tore the sheet up, and\r\nbegan again.\r\n\r\n\u201cMY DEAR VERONICA,--Your aunt tells me you have involved yourself in\r\nsome arrangement with the Widgett girls about a Fancy Dress Ball in\r\nLondon. I gather you wish to go up in some fantastic get-up, wrapped\r\nabout in your opera cloak, and that after the festivities you propose to\r\nstay with these friends of yours, and without any older people in your\r\nparty, at an hotel. Now I am sorry to cross you in anything you have set\r\nyour heart upon, but I regret to say--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m,\u201d he reflected, and crossed out the last four words.\r\n\r\n\u201c--but this cannot be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and tried again: \u201cbut I must tell you quite definitely\r\nthat I feel it to be my duty to forbid any such exploit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDamn!\u201d he remarked at the defaced letter; and, taking a fresh sheet, he\r\nrecopied what he had written. A certain irritation crept into his manner\r\nas he did so.\r\n\r\n\u201cI regret that you should ever have proposed it,\u201d he went on.\r\n\r\nHe meditated, and began a new paragraph.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe fact of it is, and this absurd project of yours only brings it to\r\na head, you have begun to get hold of some very queer ideas about what a\r\nyoung lady in your position may or may not venture to do. I do not think\r\nyou quite understand my ideals or what is becoming as between father and\r\ndaughter. Your attitude to me--\u201d\r\n\r\nHe fell into a brown study. It was so difficult to put precisely.\r\n\r\n\u201c--and your aunt--\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a time he searched for the mot juste. Then he went on:\r\n\r\n\u201c--and, indeed, to most of the established things in life is, frankly,\r\nunsatisfactory. You are restless, aggressive, critical with all\r\nthe crude unthinking criticism of youth. You have no grasp upon the\r\nessential facts of life (I pray God you never may), and in your rash\r\nignorance you are prepared to dash into positions that may end in\r\nlifelong regret. The life of a young girl is set about with prowling\r\npitfalls.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was arrested for a moment by an indistinct picture of Veronica\r\nreading this last sentence. But he was now too deeply moved to trace\r\na certain unsatisfactoriness to its source in a mixture of metaphors.\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, argumentatively, \u201cit IS. That\u2019s all about it. It\u2019s time\r\nshe knew.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe life of a young girl is set about with prowling pitfalls, from\r\nwhich she must be shielded at all costs.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis lips tightened, and he frowned with solemn resolution.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo long as I am your father, so long as your life is entrusted to my\r\ncare, I feel bound by every obligation to use my authority to check this\r\nodd disposition of yours toward extravagant enterprises. A day will come\r\nwhen you will thank me. It is not, my dear Veronica, that I think there\r\nis any harm in you; there is not. But a girl is soiled not only by evil\r\nbut by the proximity of evil, and a reputation for rashness may do\r\nher as serious an injury as really reprehensible conduct. So do please\r\nbelieve that in this matter I am acting for the best.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe signed his name and reflected. Then he opened the study door and\r\ncalled \u201cMollie!\u201d and returned to assume an attitude of authority on the\r\nhearthrug, before the blue flames and orange glow of the gas fire.\r\n\r\nHis sister appeared.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed in one of those complicated dresses that are all lace\r\nand work and confused patternings of black and purple and cream about\r\nthe body, and she was in many ways a younger feminine version of the\r\nsame theme as himself. She had the same sharp nose--which, indeed, only\r\nAnn Veronica, of all the family, had escaped. She carried herself well,\r\nwhereas her brother slouched, and there was a certain aristocratic\r\ndignity about her that she had acquired through her long engagement to\r\na curate of family, a scion of the Wiltshire Edmondshaws. He had died\r\nbefore they married, and when her brother became a widower she had\r\ncome to his assistance and taken over much of the care of his youngest\r\ndaughter. But from the first her rather old-fashioned conception of life\r\nhad jarred with the suburban atmosphere, the High School spirit and the\r\nmemories of the light and little Mrs. Stanley, whose family had been by\r\nany reckoning inconsiderable--to use the kindliest term. Miss Stanley\r\nhad determined from the outset to have the warmest affection for her\r\nyoungest niece and to be a second mother in her life--a second and a\r\nbetter one; but she had found much to battle with, and there was much in\r\nherself that Ann Veronica failed to understand. She came in now with an\r\nair of reserved solicitude.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanley pointed to the letter with a pipe he had drawn from his\r\njacket pocket. \u201cWhat do you think of that?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\nShe took it up in her many-ringed hands and read it judicially. He\r\nfilled his pipe slowly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said at last, \u201cit is firm and affectionate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could have said more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou seem to have said just what had to be said. It seems to me exactly\r\nwhat is wanted. She really must not go to that affair.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe paused, and he waited for her to speak.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she quite sees the harm of those people or the sort of\r\nlife to which they would draw her,\u201d she said. \u201cThey would spoil every\r\nchance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe has chances?\u201d he said, helping her out.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is an extremely attractive girl,\u201d she said; and added, \u201cto some\r\npeople. Of course, one doesn\u2019t like to talk about things until there are\r\nthings to talk about.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll the more reason why she shouldn\u2019t get herself talked about.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is exactly what I feel.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Stanley took the letter and stood with it in his hand thoughtfully\r\nfor a time. \u201cI\u2019d give anything,\u201d he remarked, \u201cto see our little Vee\r\nhappily and comfortably married.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe gave the note to the parlormaid the next morning in an inadvertent,\r\ncasual manner just as he was leaving the house to catch his London\r\ntrain. When Ann Veronica got it she had at first a wild, fantastic idea\r\nthat it contained a tip.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 5\r\n\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica\u2019s resolve to have things out with her father was not\r\naccomplished without difficulty.\r\n\r\nHe was not due from the City until about six, and so she went and played\r\nBadminton with the Widgett girls until dinner-time. The atmosphere at\r\ndinner was not propitious. Her aunt was blandly amiable above a certain\r\ntremulous undertow, and talked as if to a caller about the alarming\r\nspread of marigolds that summer at the end of the garden, a sort of\r\nYellow Peril to all the smaller hardy annuals, while her father brought\r\nsome papers to table and presented himself as preoccupied with them. \u201cIt\r\nreally seems as if we shall have to put down marigolds altogether next\r\nyear,\u201d Aunt Molly repeated three times, \u201cand do away with marguerites.\r\nThey seed beyond all reason.\u201d Elizabeth, the parlormaid, kept coming in\r\nto hand vegetables whenever there seemed a chance of Ann Veronica asking\r\nfor an interview. Directly dinner was over Mr. Stanley, having pretended\r\nto linger to smoke, fled suddenly up-stairs to petrography, and when\r\nVeronica tapped he answered through the locked door, \u201cGo away, Vee! I\u2019m\r\nbusy,\u201d and made a lapidary\u2019s wheel buzz loudly.\r\n\r\nBreakfast, too, was an impossible occasion. He read the Times with an\r\nunusually passionate intentness, and then declared suddenly for the\r\nearlier of the two trains he used.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll come to the station,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cI may as well come up by\r\nthis train.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI may have to run,\u201d said her father, with an appeal to his watch.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll run, too,\u201d she volunteered.\r\n\r\nInstead of which they walked sharply....\r\n\r\n\u201cI say, daddy,\u201d she began, and was suddenly short of breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf it\u2019s about that dance project,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s no good, Veronica.\r\nI\u2019ve made up my mind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll make me look a fool before all my friends.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have made an engagement until you\u2019d consulted your aunt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought I was old enough,\u201d she gasped, between laughter and crying.\r\n\r\nHer father\u2019s step quickened to a trot. \u201cI won\u2019t have you quarrelling and\r\ncrying in the Avenue,\u201d he said. \u201cStop it!... If you\u2019ve got anything\r\nto say, you must say it to your aunt--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut look here, daddy!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe flapped the Times at her with an imperious gesture.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s settled. You\u2019re not to go. You\u2019re NOT to go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s about other things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care. This isn\u2019t the place.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen may I come to the study to-night--after dinner?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m--BUSY!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s important. If I can\u2019t talk anywhere else--I DO want an\r\nunderstanding.\u201d\r\n\r\nAhead of them walked a gentleman whom it was evident they must at their\r\npresent pace very speedily overtake. It was Ramage, the occupant of the\r\nbig house at the end of the Avenue. He had recently made Mr. Stanley\u2019s\r\nacquaintance in the train and shown him one or two trifling civilities.\r\nHe was an outside broker and the proprietor of a financial newspaper; he\r\nhad come up very rapidly in the last few years, and Mr. Stanley admired\r\nand detested him in almost equal measure. It was intolerable to think\r\nthat he might overhear words and phrases. Mr. Stanley\u2019s pace slackened.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve no right to badger me like this, Veronica,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t\r\nsee what possible benefit can come of discussing things that are\r\nsettled. If you want advice, your aunt is the person. However, if you\r\nmust air your opinions--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-night, then, daddy!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe made an angry but conceivably an assenting noise, and then Ramage\r\nglanced back and stopped, saluted elaborately, and waited for them to\r\ncome up. He was a square-faced man of nearly fifty, with iron-gray hair\r\na mobile, clean-shaven mouth and rather protuberant black eyes that now\r\nscrutinized Ann Veronica. He dressed rather after the fashion of the\r\nWest End than the City, and affected a cultured urbanity that somehow\r\ndisconcerted and always annoyed Ann Veronica\u2019s father extremely. He\r\ndid not play golf, but took his exercise on horseback, which was also\r\nunsympathetic.\r\n\r\n\u201cStuffy these trees make the Avenue,\u201d said Mr. Stanley as they drew\r\nalongside, to account for his own ruffled and heated expression. \u201cThey\r\nought to have been lopped in the spring.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of time,\u201d said Ramage. \u201cIs Miss Stanley coming up with\r\nus?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI go second,\u201d she said, \u201cand change at Wimbledon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll all go second,\u201d said Ramage, \u201cif we may?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Stanley wanted to object strongly, but as he could not immediately\r\nthink how to put it, he contented himself with a grunt, and the motion\r\nwas carried. \u201cHow\u2019s Mrs. Ramage?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery much as usual,\u201d said Ramage. \u201cShe finds lying up so much very\r\nirksome. But, you see, she HAS to lie up.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe topic of his invalid wife bored him, and he turned at once to Ann\r\nVeronica. \u201cAnd where are YOU going?\u201d he said. \u201cAre you going on again\r\nthis winter with that scientific work of yours? It\u2019s an instance of\r\nheredity, I suppose.\u201d For a moment Mr. Stanley almost liked Ramage.\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a biologist, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe began to talk of his own impressions of biology as a commonplace\r\nmagazine reader who had to get what he could from the monthly reviews,\r\nand was glad to meet with any information from nearer the fountainhead.\r\nIn a little while he and she were talking quite easily and agreeably.\r\nThey went on talking in the train--it seemed to her father a slight want\r\nof deference to him--and he listened and pretended to read the Times. He\r\nwas struck disagreeably by Ramage\u2019s air of gallant consideration and Ann\r\nVeronica\u2019s self-possessed answers. These things did not harmonize with\r\nhis conception of the forthcoming (if unavoidable) interview. After\r\nall, it came to him suddenly as a harsh discovery that she might be in\r\na sense regarded as grownup. He was a man who in all things classified\r\nwithout nuance, and for him there were in the matter of age just two\r\nfeminine classes and no more--girls and women. The distinction lay\r\nchiefly in the right to pat their heads. But here was a girl--she must\r\nbe a girl, since she was his daughter and pat-able--imitating the\r\nwoman quite remarkably and cleverly. He resumed his listening. She was\r\ndiscussing one of those modern advanced plays with a remarkable, with an\r\nextraordinary, confidence.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis love-making,\u201d she remarked, \u201cstruck me as unconvincing. He seemed\r\ntoo noisy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe full significance of her words did not instantly appear to him. Then\r\nit dawned. Good heavens! She was discussing love-making. For a time he\r\nheard no more, and stared with stony eyes at a Book-War proclamation in\r\nleaded type that filled half a column of the Times that day. Could she\r\nunderstand what she was talking about? Luckily it was a second-class\r\ncarriage and the ordinary fellow-travellers were not there. Everybody,\r\nhe felt, must be listening behind their papers.\r\n\r\nOf course, girls repeat phrases and opinions of which they cannot\r\npossibly understand the meaning. But a middle-aged man like Ramage ought\r\nto know better than to draw out a girl, the daughter of a friend and\r\nneighbor....\r\n\r\nWell, after all, he seemed to be turning the subject. \u201cBroddick is a\r\nheavy man,\u201d he was saying, \u201cand the main interest of the play was the\r\nembezzlement.\u201d Thank Heaven! Mr. Stanley allowed his paper to drop\r\na little, and scrutinized the hats and brows of their three\r\nfellow-travellers.\r\n\r\nThey reached Wimbledon, and Ramage whipped out to hand Miss Stanley\r\nto the platform as though she had been a duchess, and she descended as\r\nthough such attentions from middle-aged, but still gallant, merchants\r\nwere a matter of course. Then, as Ramage readjusted himself in a corner,\r\nhe remarked: \u201cThese young people shoot up, Stanley. It seems only\r\nyesterday that she was running down the Avenue, all hair and legs.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Stanley regarded him through his glasses with something approaching\r\nanimosity.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow she\u2019s all hat and ideas,\u201d he said, with an air of humor.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe seems an unusually clever girl,\u201d said Ramage.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanley regarded his neighbor\u2019s clean-shaven face almost warily.\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure whether we don\u2019t rather overdo all this higher education,\u201d\r\n he said, with an effect of conveying profound meanings.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 6\r\n\r\n\r\nHe became quite sure, by a sort of accumulation of reflection, as the\r\nday wore on. He found his youngest daughter intrusive in his thoughts\r\nall through the morning, and still more so in the afternoon. He saw her\r\nyoung and graceful back as she descended from the carriage, severely\r\nignoring him, and recalled a glimpse he had of her face, bright and\r\nserene, as his train ran out of Wimbledon. He recalled with exasperating\r\nperplexity her clear, matter-of-fact tone as she talked about\r\nlove-making being unconvincing. He was really very proud of her, and\r\nextraordinarily angry and resentful at the innocent and audacious\r\nself-reliance that seemed to intimate her sense of absolute independence\r\nof him, her absolute security without him. After all, she only LOOKED a\r\nwoman. She was rash and ignorant, absolutely inexperienced. Absolutely.\r\nHe began to think of speeches, very firm, explicit speeches, he would\r\nmake.\r\n\r\nHe lunched in the Legal Club in Chancery Lane, and met Ogilvy. Daughters\r\nwere in the air that day. Ogilvy was full of a client\u2019s trouble in\r\nthat matter, a grave and even tragic trouble. He told some of the\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\n\u201cCurious case,\u201d said Ogilvy, buttering his bread and cutting it up in a\r\nway he had. \u201cCurious case--and sets one thinking.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe resumed, after a mouthful: \u201cHere is a girl of sixteen or seventeen,\r\nseventeen and a half to be exact, running about, as one might say, in\r\nLondon. Schoolgirl. Her family are solid West End people, Kensington\r\npeople. Father--dead. She goes out and comes home. Afterward goes on to\r\nOxford. Twenty-one, twenty-two. Why doesn\u2019t she marry? Plenty of money\r\nunder her father\u2019s will. Charming girl.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe consumed Irish stew for some moments.\r\n\r\n\u201cMarried already,\u201d he said, with his mouth full. \u201cShopman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood God!\u201d said Mr. Stanley.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-looking rascal she met at Worthing. Very romantic and all that. He\r\nfixed it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe left her alone. Pure romantic nonsense on her part. Sheer\r\ncalculation on his. Went up to Somerset House to examine the will before\r\nhe did it. Yes. Nice position.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t care for him now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit. What a girl of sixteen cares for is hair and a high color\r\nand moonlight and a tenor voice. I suppose most of our daughters would\r\nmarry organ-grinders if they had a chance--at that age. My son wanted\r\nto marry a woman of thirty in a tobacconist\u2019s shop. Only a son\u2019s another\r\nstory. We fixed that. Well, that\u2019s the situation. My people don\u2019t know\r\nwhat to do. Can\u2019t face a scandal. Can\u2019t ask the gent to go abroad and\r\ncondone a bigamy. He misstated her age and address; but you can\u2019t get\r\nhome on him for a thing like that.... There you are! Girl spoilt for\r\nlife. Makes one want to go back to the Oriental system!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Stanley poured wine. \u201cDamned Rascal!\u201d he said. \u201cIsn\u2019t there a\r\nbrother to kick him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMere satisfaction,\u201d reflected Ogilvy. \u201cMere sensuality. I rather think\r\nthey have kicked him, from the tone of some of the letters. Nice, of\r\ncourse. But it doesn\u2019t alter the situation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s these Rascals,\u201d said Mr. Stanley, and paused.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlways has been,\u201d said Ogilvy. \u201cOur interest lies in heading them off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was a time when girls didn\u2019t get these extravagant ideas.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLydia Languish, for example. Anyhow, they didn\u2019t run about so much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. That\u2019s about the beginning. It\u2019s these damned novels. All this\r\ntorrent of misleading, spurious stuff that pours from the press. These\r\nsham ideals and advanced notions. Women who Dids, and all that kind of\r\nthing....\u201d\r\n\r\nOgilvy reflected. \u201cThis girl--she\u2019s really a very charming, frank\r\nperson--had had her imagination fired, so she told me, by a school\r\nperformance of Romeo and Juliet.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Stanley decided to treat that as irrelevant. \u201cThere ought to be a\r\nCensorship of Books. We want it badly at the present time. Even WITH\r\nthe Censorship of Plays there\u2019s hardly a decent thing to which a man can\r\ntake his wife and daughters, a creeping taint of suggestion everywhere.\r\nWhat would it be without that safeguard?\u201d\r\n\r\nOgilvy pursued his own topic. \u201cI\u2019m inclined to think, Stanley, myself\r\nthat as a matter of fact it was the expurgated Romeo and Juliet did the\r\nmischief. If our young person hadn\u2019t had the nurse part cut out, eh? She\r\nmight have known more and done less. I was curious about that. All they\r\nleft it was the moon and stars. And the balcony and \u2018My Romeo!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShakespeare is altogether different from the modern stuff. Altogether\r\ndifferent. I\u2019m not discussing Shakespeare. I don\u2019t want to Bowdlerize\r\nShakespeare. I\u2019m not that sort I quite agree. But this modern miasma--\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Stanley took mustard savagely.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we won\u2019t go into Shakespeare,\u201d said Ogilvy \u201cWhat interests me\r\nis that our young women nowadays are running about as free as air\r\npractically, with registry offices and all sorts of accommodation round\r\nthe corner. Nothing to check their proceedings but a declining habit of\r\ntelling the truth and the limitations of their imaginations. And in that\r\nrespect they stir up one another. Not my affair, of course, but I think\r\nwe ought to teach them more or restrain them more. One or the other.\r\nThey\u2019re too free for their innocence or too innocent for their freedom.\r\nThat\u2019s my point. Are you going to have any apple-tart, Stanley? The\r\napple-tart\u2019s been very good lately--very good!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 7\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of dinner that evening Ann Veronica began: \u201cFather!\u201d\r\n\r\nHer father looked at her over his glasses and spoke with grave\r\ndeliberation; \u201cIf there is anything you want to say to me,\u201d he said,\r\n\u201cyou must say it in the study. I am going to smoke a little here, and\r\nthen I shall go to the study. I don\u2019t see what you can have to say. I\r\nshould have thought my note cleared up everything. There are some papers\r\nI have to look through to-night--important papers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t keep you very long, daddy,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see, Mollie,\u201d he remarked, taking a cigar from the box on\r\nthe table as his sister and daughter rose, \u201cwhy you and Vee shouldn\u2019t\r\ndiscuss this little affair--whatever it is--without bothering me.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was the first time this controversy had become triangular, for all\r\nthree of them were shy by habit.\r\n\r\nHe stopped in mid-sentence, and Ann Veronica opened the door for her\r\naunt. The air was thick with feelings. Her aunt went out of the room\r\nwith dignity and a rustle, and up-stairs to the fastness of her own\r\nroom. She agreed entirely with her brother. It distressed and confused\r\nher that the girl should not come to her.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to show a want of affection, to be a deliberate and unmerited\r\ndisregard, to justify the reprisal of being hurt.\r\n\r\nWhen Ann Veronica came into the study she found every evidence of a\r\ncarefully foreseen grouping about the gas fire. Both arm-chairs had been\r\nmoved a little so as to face each other on either side of the\r\nfender, and in the circular glow of the green-shaded lamp there lay,\r\nconspicuously waiting, a thick bundle of blue and white papers tied\r\nwith pink tape. Her father held some printed document in his hand,\r\nand appeared not to observe her entry. \u201cSit down,\u201d he said, and\r\nperused--\u201cperused\u201d is the word for it--for some moments. Then he put\r\nthe paper by. \u201cAnd what is it all about, Veronica?\u201d he asked, with a\r\ndeliberate note of irony, looking at her a little quizzically over his\r\nglasses.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica looked bright and a little elated, and she disregarded\r\nher father\u2019s invitation to be seated. She stood on the mat instead, and\r\nlooked down on him. \u201cLook here, daddy,\u201d she said, in a tone of great\r\nreasonableness, \u201cI MUST go to that dance, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer father\u2019s irony deepened. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, suavely.\r\n\r\nHer answer was not quite ready. \u201cWell, because I don\u2019t see any reason\r\nwhy I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see I do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I go?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t a suitable place; it isn\u2019t a suitable gathering.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, daddy, what do you know of the place and the gathering?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s entirely out of order; it isn\u2019t right, it isn\u2019t correct;\r\nit\u2019s impossible for you to stay in an hotel in London--the idea is\r\npreposterous. I can\u2019t imagine what possessed you, Veronica.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe put his head on one side, pulled down the corners of his mouth, and\r\nlooked at her over his glasses.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why is it preposterous?\u201d asked Ann Veronica, and fiddled with a\r\npipe on the mantel.\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely!\u201d he remarked, with an expression of worried appeal.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, daddy, I don\u2019t think it IS preposterous. That\u2019s really what\r\nI want to discuss. It comes to this--am I to be trusted to take care of\r\nmyself, or am I not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo judge from this proposal of yours, I should say not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs long as you remain under my roof--\u201d he began, and paused.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are going to treat me as though I wasn\u2019t. Well, I don\u2019t think\r\nthat\u2019s fair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour ideas of fairness--\u201d he remarked, and discontinued that sentence.\r\n\u201cMy dear girl,\u201d he said, in a tone of patient reasonableness, \u201cyou are a\r\nmere child. You know nothing of life, nothing of its dangers, nothing of\r\nits possibilities. You think everything is harmless and simple, and so\r\nforth. It isn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t. That\u2019s where you go wrong. In some things,\r\nin many things, you must trust to your elders, to those who know more of\r\nlife than you do. Your aunt and I have discussed all this matter. There\r\nit is. You can\u2019t go.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe conversation hung for a moment. Ann Veronica tried to keep hold of\r\na complicated situation and not lose her head. She had turned round\r\nsideways, so as to look down into the fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, father,\u201d she said, \u201cit isn\u2019t only this affair of the dance.\r\nI want to go to that because it\u2019s a new experience, because I think\r\nit will be interesting and give me a view of things. You say I know\r\nnothing. That\u2019s probably true. But how am I to know of things?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome things I hope you may never know,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not so sure. I want to know--just as much as I can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTut!\u201d he said, fuming, and put out his hand to the papers in the pink\r\ntape.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I do. It\u2019s just that I want to say. I want to be a human being;\r\nI want to learn about things and know about things, and not to be\r\nprotected as something too precious for life, cooped up in one narrow\r\nlittle corner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCooped up!\u201d he cried. \u201cDid I stand in the way of your going to college?\r\nHave I ever prevented you going about at any reasonable hour? You\u2019ve got\r\na bicycle!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m!\u201d said Ann Veronica, and then went on \u201cI want to be taken\r\nseriously. A girl--at my age--is grown-up. I want to go on with\r\nmy University work under proper conditions, now that I\u2019ve done the\r\nIntermediate. It isn\u2019t as though I haven\u2019t done well. I\u2019ve never muffed\r\nan exam yet. Roddy muffed two....\u201d\r\n\r\nHer father interrupted. \u201cNow look here, Veronica, let us be plain with\r\neach other. You are not going to that infidel Russell\u2019s classes. You are\r\nnot going anywhere but to the Tredgold College. I\u2019ve thought that out,\r\nand you must make up your mind to it. All sorts of considerations come\r\nin. While you live in my house you must follow my ideas. You are wrong\r\neven about that man\u2019s scientific position and his standard of work.\r\nThere are men in the Lowndean who laugh at him--simply laugh at him.\r\nAnd I have seen work by his pupils myself that struck me as being--well,\r\nnext door to shameful. There\u2019s stories, too, about his demonstrator,\r\nCapes Something or other. The kind of man who isn\u2019t content with his\r\nscience, and writes articles in the monthly reviews. Anyhow, there it\r\nis: YOU ARE NOT GOING THERE.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl received this intimation in silence, but the face that looked\r\ndown upon the gas fire took an expression of obstinacy that brought out\r\na hitherto latent resemblance between parent and child. When she spoke,\r\nher lips twitched.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I suppose when I have graduated I am to come home?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems the natural course--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd do nothing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are plenty of things a girl can find to do at home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUntil some one takes pity on me and marries me?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyebrows in mild appeal. His foot tapped impatiently, and\r\nhe took up the papers.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, father,\u201d she said, with a change in her voice, \u201csuppose I\r\nwon\u2019t stand it?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe regarded her as though this was a new idea.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuppose, for example, I go to this dance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell\u201d--her breath failed her for a moment. \u201cHow would you prevent it?\u201d\r\n she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I have forbidden it!\u201d he said, raising his voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I know. But suppose I go?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Veronica! No, no. This won\u2019t do. Understand me! I forbid it. I\r\ndo not want to hear from you even the threat of disobedience.\u201d He spoke\r\nloudly. \u201cThe thing is forbidden!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am ready to give up anything that you show to be wrong.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will give up anything I wish you to give up.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey stared at each other through a pause, and both faces were flushed\r\nand obstinate.\r\n\r\nShe was trying by some wonderful, secret, and motionless gymnastics to\r\nrestrain her tears. But when she spoke her lips quivered, and they\r\ncame. \u201cI mean to go to that dance!\u201d she blubbered. \u201cI mean to go to\r\nthat dance! I meant to reason with you, but you won\u2019t reason. You\u2019re\r\ndogmatic.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the sight of her tears his expression changed to a mingling of\r\ntriumph and concern. He stood up, apparently intending to put an\r\narm about her, but she stepped back from him quickly. She produced a\r\nhandkerchief, and with one sweep of this and a simultaneous gulp had\r\nabolished her fit of weeping. His voice now had lost its ironies.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Veronica,\u201d he pleaded, \u201cVeronica, this is most unreasonable. All\r\nwe do is for your good. Neither your aunt nor I have any other thought\r\nbut what is best for you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly you won\u2019t let me live. Only you won\u2019t let me exist!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Stanley lost patience. He bullied frankly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat nonsense is this? What raving! My dear child, you DO live, you\r\nDO exist! You have this home. You have friends, acquaintances, social\r\nstanding, brothers and sisters, every advantage! Instead of which, you\r\nwant to go to some mixed classes or other and cut up rabbits and dance\r\nabout at nights in wild costumes with casual art student friends and God\r\nknows who. That--that isn\u2019t living! You are beside yourself. You don\u2019t\r\nknow what you ask nor what you say. You have neither reason nor logic.\r\nI am sorry to seem to hurt you, but all I say is for your good. You\r\nMUST not, you SHALL not go. On this I am resolved. I put my foot down\r\nlike--like adamant. And a time will come, Veronica, mark my words, a\r\ntime will come when you will bless me for my firmness to-night. It goes\r\nto my heart to disappoint you, but this thing must not be.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe sidled toward her, but she recoiled from him, leaving him in\r\npossession of the hearth-rug.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cgood-night, father.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d he asked; \u201cnot a kiss?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe affected not to hear.\r\n\r\nThe door closed softly upon her. For a long time he remained standing\r\nbefore the fire, staring at the situation. Then he sat down and filled\r\nhis pipe slowly and thoughtfully....\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see what else I could have said,\u201d he remarked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SECOND\r\n\r\nANN VERONICA GATHERS POINTS OF VIEW\r\n\r\nPart 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you coming to the Fadden Dance, Ann Veronica?\u201d asked Constance\r\nWidgett.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica considered her answer. \u201cI mean to,\u201d she replied.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are making your dress?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuch as it is.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey were in the elder Widgett girl\u2019s bedroom; Hetty was laid up, she\r\nsaid, with a sprained ankle, and a miscellaneous party was gossiping\r\naway her tedium. It was a large, littered, self-forgetful apartment,\r\ndecorated with unframed charcoal sketches by various incipient masters;\r\nand an open bookcase, surmounted by plaster casts and the half of a\r\nhuman skull, displayed an odd miscellany of books--Shaw and Swinburne,\r\nTom Jones, Fabian Essays, Pope and Dumas, cheek by jowl. Constance\r\nWidgett\u2019s abundant copper-red hair was bent down over some dimly\r\nremunerative work--stencilling in colors upon rough, white material--at\r\na kitchen table she had dragged up-stairs for the purpose, while on her\r\nbed there was seated a slender lady of thirty or so in a dingy green\r\ndress, whom Constance had introduced with a wave of her hand as Miss\r\nMiniver. Miss Miniver looked out on the world through large emotional\r\nblue eyes that were further magnified by the glasses she wore, and her\r\nnose was pinched and pink, and her mouth was whimsically petulant. Her\r\nglasses moved quickly as her glance travelled from face to face.\r\nShe seemed bursting with the desire to talk, and watching for her\r\nopportunity. On her lapel was an ivory button, bearing the words \u201cVotes\r\nfor Women.\u201d Ann Veronica sat at the foot of the sufferer\u2019s bed, while\r\nTeddy Widgett, being something of an athlete, occupied the only\r\nbed-room chair--a decadent piece, essentially a tripod and largely a\r\nformality--and smoked cigarettes, and tried to conceal the fact that\r\nhe was looking all the time at Ann Veronica\u2019s eyebrows. Teddy was the\r\nhatless young man who had turned Ann Veronica aside from the Avenue two\r\ndays before. He was the junior of both his sisters, co-educated and\r\nmuch broken in to feminine society. A bowl of roses, just brought by\r\nAnn Veronica, adorned the communal dressing-table, and Ann Veronica was\r\nparticularly trim in preparation for a call she was to make with her\r\naunt later in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica decided to be more explicit. \u201cI\u2019ve been,\u201d she said,\r\n\u201cforbidden to come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHul-LO!\u201d said Hetty, turning her head on the pillow; and Teddy remarked\r\nwith profound emotion, \u201cMy God!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Ann Veronica, \u201cand that complicates the situation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAuntie?\u201d asked Constance, who was conversant with Ann Veronica\u2019s\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! My father. It\u2019s--it\u2019s a serious prohibition.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Hetty.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the point. I asked him why, and he hadn\u2019t a reason.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYOU ASKED YOUR FATHER FOR A REASON!\u201d said Miss Miniver, with great\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I tried to have it out with him, but he wouldn\u2019t have it out.\u201d Ann\r\nVeronica reflected for an instant \u201cThat\u2019s why I think I ought to come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou asked your father for a reason!\u201d Miss Miniver repeated.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe always have things out with OUR father, poor dear!\u201d said Hetty.\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s got almost to like it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMen,\u201d said Miss Miniver, \u201cNEVER have a reason. Never! And they don\u2019t\r\nknow it! They have no idea of it. It\u2019s one of their worst traits, one of\r\ntheir very worst.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I say, Vee,\u201d said Constance, \u201cif you come and you are forbidden to\r\ncome there\u2019ll be the deuce of a row.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica was deciding for further confidences. Her situation\r\nwas perplexing her very much, and the Widgett atmosphere was lax and\r\nsympathetic, and provocative of discussion. \u201cIt isn\u2019t only the dance,\u201d\r\n she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s the classes,\u201d said Constance, the well-informed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s the whole situation. Apparently I\u2019m not to exist yet. I\u2019m not\r\nto study, I\u2019m not to grow. I\u2019ve got to stay at home and remain in a\r\nstate of suspended animation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDUSTING!\u201d said Miss Miniver, in a sepulchral voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cUntil you marry, Vee,\u201d said Hetty.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t feel like standing it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThousands of women have married merely for freedom,\u201d said Miss Miniver.\r\n\u201cThousands! Ugh! And found it a worse slavery.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d said Constance, stencilling away at bright pink petals,\r\n\u201cit\u2019s our lot. But it\u2019s very beastly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s our lot?\u201d asked her sister.\r\n\r\n\u201cSlavery! Downtroddenness! When I think of it I feel all over boot\r\nmarks--men\u2019s boots. We hide it bravely, but so it is. Damn! I\u2019ve\r\nsplashed.\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Miniver\u2019s manner became impressive. She addressed Ann Veronica\r\nwith an air of conveying great open secrets to her. \u201cAs things are at\r\npresent,\u201d she said, \u201cit is true. We live under man-made institutions,\r\nand that is what they amount to. Every girl in the world practically,\r\nexcept a few of us who teach or type-write, and then we\u2019re underpaid and\r\nsweated--it\u2019s dreadful to think how we are sweated!\u201d She had lost her\r\ngeneralization, whatever it was. She hung for a moment, and then went\r\non, conclusively, \u201cUntil we have the vote that is how things WILL be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m all for the vote,\u201d said Teddy.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose a girl MUST be underpaid and sweated,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cI\r\nsuppose there\u2019s no way of getting a decent income--independently.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWomen have practically NO economic freedom,\u201d said Miss Miniver,\r\n\u201cbecause they have no political freedom. Men have seen to that. The one\r\nprofession, the one decent profession, I mean, for a woman--except the\r\nstage--is teaching, and there we trample on one another. Everywhere\r\nelse--the law, medicine, the Stock Exchange--prejudice bars us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s art,\u201d said Ann Veronica, \u201cand writing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery one hasn\u2019t the Gift. Even there a woman never gets a fair chance.\r\nMen are against her. Whatever she does is minimized. All the best\r\nnovels have been written by women, and yet see how men sneer at the lady\r\nnovelist still! There\u2019s only one way to get on for a woman, and that is\r\nto please men. That is what they think we are for!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re beasts,\u201d said Teddy. \u201cBeasts!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Miss Miniver took no notice of his admission.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Miss Miniver--she went on in a regularly undulating\r\nvoice--\u201cwe DO please men. We have that gift. We can see round them and\r\nbehind them and through them, and most of us use that knowledge, in the\r\nsilent way we have, for our great ends. Not all of us, but some of us.\r\nToo many. I wonder what men would say if we threw the mask aside--if\r\nwe really told them what WE thought of them, really showed them what WE\r\nwere.\u201d A flush of excitement crept into her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\u201cMaternity,\u201d she said, \u201chas been our undoing.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrom that she opened out into a long, confused emphatic discourse on the\r\nposition of women, full of wonderful statements, while Constance worked\r\nat her stencilling and Ann Veronica and Hetty listened, and Teddy\r\ncontributed sympathetic noises and consumed cheap cigarettes. As she\r\ntalked she made weak little gestures with her hands, and she thrust her\r\nface forward from her bent shoulders; and she peered sometimes at Ann\r\nVeronica and sometimes at a photograph of the Axenstrasse, near\r\nFluelen, that hung upon the wall. Ann Veronica watched her face, vaguely\r\nsympathizing with her, vaguely disliking her physical insufficiency and\r\nher convulsive movements, and the fine eyebrows were knit with a faint\r\nperplexity. Essentially the talk was a mixture of fragments of sentences\r\nheard, of passages read, or arguments indicated rather than stated, and\r\nall of it was served in a sauce of strange enthusiasm, thin yet\r\nintense. Ann Veronica had had some training at the Tredgold College in\r\ndisentangling threads from confused statements, and she had a curious\r\npersuasion that in all this fluent muddle there was something--something\r\nreal, something that signified. But it was very hard to follow. She did\r\nnot understand the note of hostility to men that ran through it all, the\r\nbitter vindictiveness that lit Miss Miniver\u2019s cheeks and eyes, the\r\nsense of some at last insupportable wrong slowly accumulated. She had no\r\ninkling of that insupportable wrong.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are the species,\u201d said Miss Miniver, \u201cmen are only incidents.\r\nThey give themselves airs, but so it is. In all the species of animals\r\nthe females are more important than the males; the males have to please\r\nthem. Look at the cock\u2019s feathers, look at the competition there is\r\neverywhere, except among humans. The stags and oxen and things all\r\nhave to fight for us, everywhere. Only in man is the male made the\r\nmost important. And that happens through our maternity; it\u2019s our very\r\nimportance that degrades us.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhile we were minding the children they stole our rights and liberties.\r\nThe children made us slaves, and the men took advantage of it.\r\nIt\u2019s--Mrs. Shalford says--the accidental conquering the essential.\r\nOriginally in the first animals there were no males, none at all. It\r\nhas been proved. Then they appear among the lower things\u201d--she made\r\nmeticulous gestures to figure the scale of life; she seemed to be\r\nholding up specimens, and peering through her glasses at them--\u201camong\r\ncrustaceans and things, just as little creatures, ever so inferior to\r\nthe females. Mere hangers on. Things you would laugh at. And among human\r\nbeings, too, women to begin with were the rulers and leaders; they owned\r\nall the property, they invented all the arts.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe primitive government was the Matriarchate. The Matriarchate! The\r\nLords of Creation just ran about and did what they were told.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut is that really so?\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt has been proved,\u201d said Miss Miniver, and added, \u201cby American\r\nprofessors.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how did they prove it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy science,\u201d said Miss Miniver, and hurried on, putting out a\r\nrhetorical hand that showed a slash of finger through its glove. \u201cAnd\r\nnow, look at us! See what we have become. Toys! Delicate trifles! A sex\r\nof invalids. It is we who have become the parasites and toys.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was, Ann Veronica felt, at once absurd and extraordinarily right.\r\nHetty, who had periods of lucid expression, put the thing for her\r\nfrom her pillow. She charged boldly into the space of Miss Miniver\u2019s\r\nrhetorical pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t quite that we\u2019re toys. Nobody toys with me. Nobody regards\r\nConstance or Vee as a delicate trifle.\u201d\r\n\r\nTeddy made some confused noise, a thoracic street row; some remark was\r\nassassinated by a rival in his throat and buried hastily under a cough.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019d better not,\u201d said Hetty. \u201cThe point is we\u2019re not toys, toys\r\nisn\u2019t the word; we\u2019re litter. We\u2019re handfuls. We\u2019re regarded as\r\ninflammable litter that mustn\u2019t be left about. We are the species, and\r\nmaternity is our game; that\u2019s all right, but nobody wants that admitted\r\nfor fear we should all catch fire, and set about fulfilling the purpose\r\nof our beings without waiting for further explanations. As if we didn\u2019t\r\nknow! The practical trouble is our ages. They used to marry us off at\r\nseventeen, rush us into things before we had time to protest. They don\u2019t\r\nnow. Heaven knows why! They don\u2019t marry most of us off now until high up\r\nin the twenties. And the age gets higher. We have to hang about in the\r\ninterval. There\u2019s a great gulf opened, and nobody\u2019s got any plans what\r\nto do with us. So the world is choked with waste and waiting daughters.\r\nHanging about! And they start thinking and asking questions, and begin\r\nto be neither one thing nor the other. We\u2019re partly human beings and\r\npartly females in suspense.\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Miniver followed with an expression of perplexity, her mouth shaped\r\nto futile expositions. The Widgett method of thought puzzled her weakly\r\nrhetorical mind. \u201cThere is no remedy, girls,\u201d she began, breathlessly,\r\n\u201cexcept the Vote. Give us that--\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica came in with a certain disregard of Miss Miniver. \u201cThat\u2019s\r\nit,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have no plans for us. They have no ideas what to do\r\nwith us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcept,\u201d said Constance, surveying her work with her head on one side,\r\n\u201cto keep the matches from the litter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd they won\u2019t let us make plans for ourselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will,\u201d said Miss Miniver, refusing to be suppressed, \u201cif some of us\r\nhave to be killed to get it.\u201d And she pressed her lips together in white\r\nresolution and nodded, and she was manifestly full of that same passion\r\nfor conflict and self-sacrifice that has given the world martyrs since\r\nthe beginning of things. \u201cI wish I could make every woman, every girl,\r\nsee this as clearly as I see it--just what the Vote means to us. Just\r\nwhat it means....\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Ann Veronica went back along the Avenue to her aunt she became aware\r\nof a light-footed pursuer running. Teddy overtook her, a little out of\r\nbreath, his innocent face flushed, his straw-colored hair disordered. He\r\nwas out of breath, and spoke in broken sentences.\r\n\r\n\u201cI say, Vee. Half a minute, Vee. It\u2019s like this: You want freedom. Look\r\nhere. You know--if you want freedom. Just an idea of mine. You know\r\nhow those Russian students do? In Russia. Just a formal marriage. Mere\r\nformality. Liberates the girl from parental control. See? You marry me.\r\nSimply. No further responsibility whatever. Without hindrance--present\r\noccupation. Why not? Quite willing. Get a license--just an idea of mine.\r\nDoesn\u2019t matter a bit to me. Do anything to please you, Vee. Anything.\r\nNot fit to be dust on your boots. Still--there you are!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe paused.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica\u2019s desire to laugh unrestrainedly was checked by the\r\ntremendous earnestness of his expression. \u201cAwfully good of you, Teddy.\u201d\r\n she said.\r\n\r\nHe nodded silently, too full for words.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t see,\u201d said Ann Veronica, \u201cjust how it fits the present\r\nsituation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! Well, I just suggested it. Threw it out. Of course, if at any\r\ntime--see reason--alter your opinion. Always at your service. No\r\noffence, I hope. All right! I\u2019m off. Due to play hockey. Jackson\u2019s.\r\nHorrid snorters! So long, Vee! Just suggested it. See? Nothing really.\r\nPassing thought.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTeddy,\u201d said Ann Veronica, \u201cyou\u2019re a dear!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, quite!\u201d said Teddy, convulsively, and lifted an imaginary hat and\r\nleft her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3\r\n\r\n\r\nThe call Ann Veronica paid with her aunt that afternoon had at first\r\nmuch the same relation to the Widgett conversation that a plaster statue\r\nof Mr. Gladstone would have to a carelessly displayed interior on a\r\ndissecting-room table. The Widgetts talked with a remarkable absence of\r\nexternal coverings; the Palsworthys found all the meanings of life on\r\nits surfaces. They seemed the most wrapped things in all Ann Veronica\u2019s\r\nwrappered world. The Widgett mental furniture was perhaps worn and\r\nshabby, but there it was before you, undisguised, fading visibly in an\r\nalmost pitiless sunlight. Lady Palsworthy was the widow of a knight\r\nwho had won his spurs in the wholesale coal trade, she was of good\r\nseventeenth-century attorney blood, a county family, and distantly\r\nrelated to Aunt Mollie\u2019s deceased curate. She was the social leader of\r\nMorningside Park, and in her superficial and euphuistic way an extremely\r\nkind and pleasant woman. With her lived a Mrs. Pramlay, a sister of\r\nthe Morningside Park doctor, and a very active and useful member of the\r\nCommittee of the Impoverished Gentlewomen\u2019s Aid Society. Both ladies\r\nwere on easy and friendly terms with all that was best in Morningside\r\nPark society; they had an afternoon once a month that was quite well\r\nattended, they sometimes gave musical evenings, they dined out and gave\r\na finish to people\u2019s dinners, they had a full-sized croquet lawn and\r\ntennis beyond, and understood the art of bringing people together.\r\nAnd they never talked of anything at all, never discussed, never even\r\nencouraged gossip. They were just nice.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica found herself walking back down the Avenue that had just\r\nbeen the scene of her first proposal beside her aunt, and speculating\r\nfor the first time in her life about that lady\u2019s mental attitudes. Her\r\nprevailing effect was one of quiet and complete assurance, as though she\r\nknew all about everything, and was only restrained by her instinctive\r\ndelicacy from telling what she knew. But the restraint exercised by her\r\ninstinctive delicacy was very great; over and above coarse or sexual\r\nmatters it covered religion and politics and any mention of money\r\nmatters or crime, and Ann Veronica found herself wondering whether these\r\nexclusions represented, after all, anything more than suppressions. Was\r\nthere anything at all in those locked rooms of her aunt\u2019s mind? Were\r\nthey fully furnished and only a little dusty and cobwebby and in need of\r\nan airing, or were they stark vacancy except, perhaps, for a cockroach\r\nor so or the gnawing of a rat? What was the mental equivalent of a rat\u2019s\r\ngnawing? The image was going astray. But what would her aunt think of\r\nTeddy\u2019s recent off-hand suggestion of marriage? What would she think of\r\nthe Widgett conversation? Suppose she was to tell her aunt quietly\r\nbut firmly about the parasitic males of degraded crustacea. The girl\r\nsuppressed a chuckle that would have been inexplicable.\r\n\r\nThere came a wild rush of anthropological lore into her brain, a flare\r\nof indecorous humor. It was one of the secret troubles of her mind, this\r\ngrotesque twist her ideas would sometimes take, as though they rebelled\r\nand rioted. After all, she found herself reflecting, behind her aunt\u2019s\r\ncomplacent visage there was a past as lurid as any one\u2019s--not, of\r\ncourse, her aunt\u2019s own personal past, which was apparently just that\r\ncurate and almost incredibly jejune, but an ancestral past with all\r\nsorts of scandalous things in it: fire and slaughterings, exogamy,\r\nmarriage by capture, corroborees, cannibalism! Ancestresses with perhaps\r\ndim anticipatory likenesses to her aunt, their hair less neatly done,\r\nno doubt, their manners and gestures as yet undisciplined, but still\r\nancestresses in the direct line, must have danced through a brief and\r\nstirring life in the woady buff. Was there no echo anywhere in Miss\r\nStanley\u2019s pacified brain? Those empty rooms, if they were empty, were\r\nthe equivalents of astoundingly decorated predecessors. Perhaps it was\r\njust as well there was no inherited memory.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica was by this time quite shocked at her own thoughts, and yet\r\nthey would go on with their freaks. Great vistas of history opened, and\r\nshe and her aunt were near reverting to the primitive and passionate and\r\nentirely indecorous arboreal--were swinging from branches by the\r\narms, and really going on quite dreadfully--when their arrival at\r\nthe Palsworthys\u2019 happily checked this play of fancy, and brought Ann\r\nVeronica back to the exigencies of the wrappered life again.\r\n\r\nLady Palsworthy liked Ann Veronica because she was never awkward,\r\nhad steady eyes, and an almost invariable neatness and dignity in her\r\nclothes. She seemed just as stiff and shy as a girl ought to be, Lady\r\nPalsworthy thought, neither garrulous nor unready, and free from nearly\r\nall the heavy aggressiveness, the overgrown, overblown quality, the\r\negotism and want of consideration of the typical modern girl. But then\r\nLady Palsworthy had never seen Ann Veronica running like the wind\r\nat hockey. She had never seen her sitting on tables nor heard her\r\ndiscussing theology, and had failed to observe that the graceful figure\r\nwas a natural one and not due to ably chosen stays. She took it for\r\ngranted Ann Veronica wore stays--mild stays, perhaps, but stays, and\r\nthought no more of the matter. She had seen her really only at teas,\r\nwith the Stanley strain in her uppermost. There are so many girls\r\nnowadays who are quite unpresentable at tea, with their untrimmed\r\nlaughs, their awful dispositions of their legs when they sit down, their\r\nslangy disrespect; they no longer smoke, it is true, like the girls of\r\nthe eighties and nineties, nevertheless to a fine intelligence they have\r\nthe flavor of tobacco. They have no amenities, they scratch the\r\nmellow surface of things almost as if they did it on purpose; and\r\nLady Palsworthy and Mrs. Pramlay lived for amenities and the mellowed\r\nsurfaces of things. Ann Veronica was one of the few young people--and\r\none must have young people just as one must have flowers--one could ask\r\nto a little gathering without the risk of a painful discord. Then the\r\ndistant relationship to Miss Stanley gave them a slight but pleasant\r\nsense of proprietorship in the girl. They had their little dreams about\r\nher.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pramlay received them in the pretty chintz drawing-room, which\r\nopened by French windows on the trim garden, with its croquet lawn, its\r\ntennis-net in the middle distance, and its remote rose alley lined\r\nwith smart dahlias and flaming sunflowers. Her eye met Miss Stanley\u2019s\r\nunderstandingly, and she was if anything a trifle more affectionate in\r\nher greeting to Ann Veronica. Then Ann Veronica passed on toward the\r\ntea in the garden, which was dotted with the elite of Morningside Park\r\nsociety, and there she was pounced upon by Lady Palsworthy and given tea\r\nand led about. Across the lawn and hovering indecisively, Ann Veronica\r\nsaw and immediately affected not to see Mr. Manning, Lady Palsworthy\u2019s\r\nnephew, a tall young man of seven-and-thirty with a handsome,\r\nthoughtful, impassive face, a full black mustache, and a certain heavy\r\nluxuriousness of gesture. The party resolved itself for Ann Veronica\r\ninto a game in which she manoeuvred unostentatiously and finally\r\nunsuccessfully to avoid talking alone with this gentleman.\r\n\r\nMr. Manning had shown on previous occasions that he found Ann Veronica\r\ninteresting and that he wished to interest her. He was a civil servant\r\nof some standing, and after a previous conversation upon aesthetics of\r\na sententious, nebulous, and sympathetic character, he had sent her a\r\nsmall volume, which he described as the fruits of his leisure and which\r\nwas as a matter of fact rather carefully finished verse. It dealt with\r\nfine aspects of Mr. Manning\u2019s feelings, and as Ann Veronica\u2019s mind\r\nwas still largely engaged with fundamentals and found no pleasure in\r\nmetrical forms, she had not as yet cut its pages. So that as she saw him\r\nshe remarked to herself very faintly but definitely, \u201cOh, golly!\u201d and\r\nset up a campaign of avoidance that Mr. Manning at last broke down by\r\ncoming directly at her as she talked with the vicar\u2019s aunt about some of\r\nthe details of the alleged smell of the new church lamps. He did not so\r\nmuch cut into this conversation as loom over it, for he was a tall, if\r\nrather studiously stooping, man.\r\n\r\nThe face that looked down upon Ann Veronica was full of amiable\r\nintention. \u201cSplendid you are looking to-day, Miss Stanley,\u201d he said.\r\n\u201cHow well and jolly you must be feeling.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe beamed over the effect of this and shook hands with effusion, and\r\nLady Palsworthy suddenly appeared as his confederate and disentangled\r\nthe vicar\u2019s aunt.\r\n\r\n\u201cI love this warm end of summer more than words can tell,\u201d he said.\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried to make words tell it. It\u2019s no good. Mild, you know, and\r\nboon. You want music.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica agreed, and tried to make the manner of her assent cover a\r\npossible knowledge of a probable poem.\r\n\r\n\u201cSplendid it must be to be a composer. Glorious! The Pastoral.\r\nBeethoven; he\u2019s the best of them. Don\u2019t you think? Tum, tay, tum, tay.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica did.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you been doing since our last talk? Still cutting up\r\nrabbits and probing into things? I\u2019ve often thought of that talk of\r\nours--often.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe did not appear to require any answer to his question.\r\n\r\n\u201cOften,\u201d he repeated, a little heavily.\r\n\r\n\u201cBeautiful these autumn flowers are,\u201d said Ann Veronica, in a wide,\r\nuncomfortable pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo come and see the Michaelmas daisies at the end of the garden,\u201d said\r\nMr. Manning, \u201cthey\u2019re a dream.\u201d And Ann Veronica found herself being\r\ncarried off to an isolation even remoter and more conspicuous than the\r\ncorner of the lawn, with the whole of the party aiding and abetting and\r\nglancing at them. \u201cDamn!\u201d said Ann Veronica to herself, rousing herself\r\nfor a conflict.\r\n\r\nMr. Manning told her he loved beauty, and extorted a similar admission\r\nfrom her; he then expatiated upon his own love of beauty. He said that\r\nfor him beauty justified life, that he could not imagine a good action\r\nthat was not a beautiful one nor any beautiful thing that could be\r\naltogether bad. Ann Veronica hazarded an opinion that as a matter of\r\nhistory some very beautiful people had, to a quite considerable extent,\r\nbeen bad, but Mr. Manning questioned whether when they were bad they\r\nwere really beautiful or when they were beautiful bad. Ann Veronica\r\nfound her attention wandering a little as he told her that he was not\r\nashamed to feel almost slavish in the presence of really beautiful\r\npeople, and then they came to the Michaelmas daisies. They were really\r\nvery fine and abundant, with a blaze of perennial sunflowers behind\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey make me want to shout,\u201d said Mr. Manning, with a sweep of the arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re very good this year,\u201d said Ann Veronica, avoiding controversial\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\u201cEither I want to shout,\u201d said Mr. Manning, \u201cwhen I see beautiful\r\nthings, or else I want to weep.\u201d He paused and looked at her, and said,\r\nwith a sudden drop into a confidential undertone, \u201cOr else I want to\r\npray.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen is Michaelmas Day?\u201d said Ann Veronica, a little abruptly.\r\n\r\n\u201cHeaven knows!\u201d said Mr. Manning; and added, \u201cthe twenty-ninth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought it was earlier,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cWasn\u2019t Parliament to\r\nreassemble?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe put out his hand and leaned against a tree and crossed his legs.\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not interested in politics?\u201d he asked, almost with a note of\r\nprotest.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, rather,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cIt seems--It\u2019s interesting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think so? I find my interest in that sort of thing decline and\r\ndecline.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m curious. Perhaps because I don\u2019t know. I suppose an intelligent\r\nperson OUGHT to be interested in political affairs. They concern us\r\nall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d said Mr. Manning, with a baffling smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think they do. After all, they\u2019re history in the making.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA sort of history,\u201d said Mr. Manning; and repeated, \u201ca sort of history.\r\nBut look at these glorious daisies!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you think political questions ARE important?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they are this afternoon, and I don\u2019t think they are to\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica turned her back on the Michaelmas daisies, and faced toward\r\nthe house with an air of a duty completed.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust come to that seat now you are here, Miss Stanley, and look down\r\nthe other path; there\u2019s a vista of just the common sort. Better even\r\nthan these.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica walked as he indicated.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m old-fashioned, Miss Stanley. I don\u2019t think women need to\r\ntrouble about political questions.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI want a vote,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cReally!\u201d said Mr. Manning, in an earnest voice, and waved his hand to\r\nthe alley of mauve and purple. \u201cI wish you didn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d She turned on him.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt jars. It jars with all my ideas. Women to me are something so\r\nserene, so fine, so feminine, and politics are so dusty, so sordid,\r\nso wearisome and quarrelsome. It seems to me a woman\u2019s duty to be\r\nbeautiful, to BE beautiful and to behave beautifully, and politics\r\nare by their very nature ugly. You see, I--I am a woman worshipper.\r\nI worshipped women long before I found any woman I might ever hope\r\nto worship. Long ago. And--the idea of committees, of hustings, of\r\nagenda-papers!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why the responsibility of beauty should all be shifted on\r\nto the women,\u201d said Ann Veronica, suddenly remembering a part of Miss\r\nMiniver\u2019s discourse.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt rests with them by the nature of things. Why should you who are\r\nqueens come down from your thrones? If you can afford it, WE can\u2019t. We\r\ncan\u2019t afford to turn our women, our Madonnas, our Saint Catherines, our\r\nMona Lisas, our goddesses and angels and fairy princesses, into a sort\r\nof man. Womanhood is sacred to me. My politics in that matter wouldn\u2019t\r\nbe to give women votes. I\u2019m a Socialist, Miss Stanley.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWHAT?\u201d said Ann Veronica, startled.\r\n\r\n\u201cA Socialist of the order of John Ruskin. Indeed I am! I would make this\r\ncountry a collective monarchy, and all the girls and women in it should\r\nbe the Queen. They should never come into contact with politics or\r\neconomics--or any of those things. And we men would work for them and\r\nserve them in loyal fealty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s rather the theory now,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cOnly so many men\r\nneglect their duties.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Mr. Manning, with an air of emerging from an elaborate\r\ndemonstration, \u201cand so each of us must, under existing conditions, being\r\nchivalrous indeed to all women, choose for himself his own particular\r\nand worshipful queen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo far as one can judge from the system in practice,\u201d said Ann\r\nVeronica, speaking in a loud, common-sense, detached tone, and beginning\r\nto walk slowly but resolutely toward the lawn, \u201cit doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery one must be experimental,\u201d said Mr. Manning, and glanced round\r\nhastily for further horticultural points of interest in secluded\r\ncorners. None presented themselves to save him from that return.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all very well when one isn\u2019t the material experimented upon,\u201d\r\n Ann Veronica had remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWomen would--they DO have far more power than they think, as\r\ninfluences, as inspirations.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica said nothing in answer to that.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou say you want a vote,\u201d said Mr. Manning, abruptly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I ought to have one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have two,\u201d said Mr. Manning--\u201cone in Oxford University and one\r\nin Kensington.\u201d He caught up and went on with a sort of clumsiness: \u201cLet\r\nme present you with them and be your voter.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere followed an instant\u2019s pause, and then Ann Veronica had decided to\r\nmisunderstand.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want a vote for myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see why I should take it\r\nsecond-hand. Though it\u2019s very kind of you. And rather unscrupulous. Have\r\nyou ever voted, Mr. Manning? I suppose there\u2019s a sort of place like a\r\nticket-office. And a ballot-box--\u201d Her face assumed an expression of\r\nintellectual conflict. \u201cWhat is a ballot-box like, exactly?\u201d she asked,\r\nas though it was very important to her.\r\n\r\nMr. Manning regarded her thoughtfully for a moment and stroked his\r\nmustache. \u201cA ballot-box, you know,\u201d he said, \u201cis very largely just a\r\nbox.\u201d He made quite a long pause, and went on, with a sigh: \u201cYou have a\r\nvoting paper given you--\u201d\r\n\r\nThey emerged into the publicity of the lawn.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Ann Veronica, \u201cyes,\u201d to his explanation, and saw across\r\nthe lawn Lady Palsworthy talking to her aunt, and both of them staring\r\nfrankly across at her and Mr. Manning as they talked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRD\r\n\r\nTHE MORNING OF THE CRISIS\r\n\r\nPart 1\r\n\r\nTwo days after came the day of the Crisis, the day of the Fadden Dance.\r\nIt would have been a crisis anyhow, but it was complicated in Ann\r\nVeronica\u2019s mind by the fact that a letter lay on the breakfast-table\r\nfrom Mr. Manning, and that her aunt focussed a brightly tactful\r\ndisregard upon this throughout the meal. Ann Veronica had come down\r\nthinking of nothing in the world but her inflexible resolution to go to\r\nthe dance in the teeth of all opposition. She did not know Mr. Manning\u2019s\r\nhandwriting, and opened his letter and read some lines before its import\r\nappeared. Then for a time she forgot the Fadden affair altogether.\r\nWith a well-simulated unconcern and a heightened color she finished her\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nShe was not obliged to go to the Tredgold College, because as yet the\r\nCollege had not settled down for the session. She was supposed to be\r\nreading at home, and after breakfast she strolled into the vegetable\r\ngarden, and having taken up a position upon the staging of a disused\r\ngreenhouse that had the double advantage of being hidden from the\r\nwindows of the house and secure from the sudden appearance of any one,\r\nshe resumed the reading of Mr. Manning\u2019s letter.\r\n\r\nMr. Manning\u2019s handwriting had an air of being clear without being easily\r\nlegible; it was large and rather roundish, with a lack of definition\r\nabout the letters and a disposition to treat the large ones as\r\nliberal-minded people nowadays treat opinions, as all amounting to the\r\nsame thing really--a years-smoothed boyish rather than an adult hand.\r\nAnd it filled seven sheets of notepaper, each written only on one side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cMY DEAR MISS STANLEY,\u201d it began,--\u201cI hope you will forgive my\r\nbothering you with a letter, but I have been thinking very much over our\r\nconversation at Lady Palsworthy\u2019s, and I feel there are things I want\r\nto say to you so much that I cannot wait until we meet again. It is the\r\nworst of talk under such social circumstances that it is always getting\r\ncut off so soon as it is beginning; and I went home that afternoon\r\nfeeling I had said nothing--literally nothing--of the things I had meant\r\nto say to you and that were coursing through my head. They were things I\r\nhad meant very much to talk to you about, so that I went home vexed and\r\ndisappointed, and only relieved myself a little by writing a few verses.\r\nI wonder if you will mind very much when I tell you they were suggested\r\nby you. You must forgive the poet\u2019s license I take. Here is one verse.\r\nThe metrical irregularity is intentional, because I want, as it were, to\r\nput you apart: to change the lilt and the mood altogether when I speak\r\nof you.\r\n\r\n     \u201c\u2018A SONG OF LADIES AND MY LADY\r\n\r\n     \u201c\u2018Saintly white and a lily is Mary,\r\n     Margaret\u2019s violets, sweet and shy;\r\n     Green and dewy is Nellie-bud fairy,\r\n     Forget-me-nots live in Gwendolen\u2019s eye.\r\n     Annabel shines like a star in the darkness,\r\n     Rosamund queens it a rose, deep rose;\r\n     But the lady I love is like sunshine in April weather,\r\n     She gleams and gladdens, she warms--and goes.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cCrude, I admit. But let that verse tell my secret. All bad\r\nverse--originally the epigram was Lang\u2019s, I believe--is written in a\r\nstate of emotion.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Miss Stanley, when I talked to you the other afternoon of work\r\nand politics and such-like things, my mind was all the time resenting it\r\nbeyond measure. There we were discussing whether you should have a vote,\r\nand I remembered the last occasion we met it was about your prospects of\r\nsuccess in the medical profession or as a Government official such as a\r\nnumber of women now are, and all the time my heart was crying out within\r\nme, \u2018Here is the Queen of your career.\u2019 I wanted, as I have never wanted\r\nbefore, to take you up, to make you mine, to carry you off and set you\r\napart from all the strain and turmoil of life. For nothing will ever\r\nconvince me that it is not the man\u2019s share in life to shield, to\r\nprotect, to lead and toil and watch and battle with the world at large.\r\nI want to be your knight, your servant, your protector, your--I dare\r\nscarcely write the word--your husband. So I come suppliant. I am\r\nfive-and-thirty, and I have knocked about in the world and tasted the\r\nquality of life. I had a hard fight to begin with to win my way into the\r\nUpper Division--I was third on a list of forty-seven--and since then I\r\nhave found myself promoted almost yearly in a widening sphere of social\r\nservice. Before I met you I never met any one whom I felt I could\r\nlove, but you have discovered depths in my own nature I had scarcely\r\nsuspected. Except for a few early ebullitions of passion, natural to\r\na warm and romantic disposition, and leaving no harmful\r\nafter-effects--ebullitions that by the standards of the higher truth I\r\nfeel no one can justly cast a stone at, and of which I for one am by no\r\nmeans ashamed--I come to you a pure and unencumbered man. I love you.\r\nIn addition to my public salary I have a certain private property and\r\nfurther expectations through my aunt, so that I can offer you a life\r\nof wide and generous refinement, travel, books, discussion, and easy\r\nrelations with a circle of clever and brilliant and thoughtful people\r\nwith whom my literary work has brought me into contact, and of which,\r\nseeing me only as you have done alone in Morningside Park, you can have\r\nno idea. I have a certain standing not only as a singer but as a critic,\r\nand I belong to one of the most brilliant causerie dinner clubs of\r\nthe day, in which successful Bohemianism, politicians, men of affairs,\r\nartists, sculptors, and cultivated noblemen generally, mingle together\r\nin the easiest and most delightful intercourse. That is my real milieu,\r\nand one that I am convinced you would not only adorn but delight in.\r\n\r\n\u201cI find it very hard to write this letter. There are so many things\r\nI want to tell you, and they stand on such different levels, that\r\nthe effect is necessarily confusing and discordant, and I find myself\r\ndoubting if I am really giving you the thread of emotion that should run\r\nthrough all this letter. For although I must confess it reads very much\r\nlike an application or a testimonial or some such thing as that, I can\r\nassure you I am writing this in fear and trembling with a sinking heart.\r\nMy mind is full of ideas and images that I have been cherishing and\r\naccumulating--dreams of travelling side by side, of lunching quietly\r\ntogether in some jolly restaurant, of moonlight and music and all that\r\nside of life, of seeing you dressed like a queen and shining in some\r\nbrilliant throng--mine; of your looking at flowers in some old-world\r\ngarden, our garden--there are splendid places to be got down in Surrey,\r\nand a little runabout motor is quite within my means. You know they say,\r\nas, indeed, I have just quoted already, that all bad poetry is written\r\nin a state of emotion, but I have no doubt that this is true of bad\r\noffers of marriage. I have often felt before that it is only when one\r\nhas nothing to say that one can write easy poetry. Witness Browning. And\r\nhow can I get into one brief letter the complex accumulated desires of\r\nwhat is now, I find on reference to my diary, nearly sixteen months of\r\nletting my mind run on you--ever since that jolly party at Surbiton,\r\nwhere we raced and beat the other boat. You steered and I rowed stroke.\r\nMy very sentences stumble and give way. But I do not even care if I am\r\nabsurd. I am a resolute man, and hitherto when I have wanted a thing I\r\nhave got it; but I have never yet wanted anything in my life as I have\r\nwanted you. It isn\u2019t the same thing. I am afraid because I love you, so\r\nthat the mere thought of failure hurts. If I did not love you so much I\r\nbelieve I could win you by sheer force of character, for people tell me\r\nI am naturally of the dominating type. Most of my successes in life have\r\nbeen made with a sort of reckless vigor.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have said what I had to say, stumblingly and badly, and baldly.\r\nBut I am sick of tearing up letters and hopeless of getting what I have\r\nto say better said. It would be easy enough for me to write an eloquent\r\nletter about something else. Only I do not care to write about anything\r\nelse. Let me put the main question to you now that I could not put the\r\nother afternoon. Will you marry me, Ann Veronica?\r\n\r\n\u201cVery sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n\u201cHUBERT MANNING.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica read this letter through with grave, attentive eyes.\r\n\r\nHer interest grew as she read, a certain distaste disappeared. Twice she\r\nsmiled, but not unkindly. Then she went back and mixed up the sheets in\r\na search for particular passages. Finally she fell into reflection.\r\n\r\n\u201cOdd!\u201d she said. \u201cI suppose I shall have to write an answer. It\u2019s so\r\ndifferent from what one has been led to expect.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe became aware of her aunt, through the panes of the greenhouse,\r\nadvancing with an air of serene unconsciousness from among the raspberry\r\ncanes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo you don\u2019t!\u201d said Ann Veronica, and walked out at a brisk and\r\nbusiness-like pace toward the house.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going for a long tramp, auntie,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlone, dear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, aunt. I\u2019ve got a lot of things to think about.\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Stanley reflected as Ann Veronica went toward the house. She\r\nthought her niece very hard and very self-possessed and self-confident.\r\nShe ought to be softened and tender and confidential at this phase of\r\nher life. She seemed to have no idea whatever of the emotional states\r\nthat were becoming to her age and position. Miss Stanley walked round\r\nthe garden thinking, and presently house and garden reverberated to Ann\r\nVeronica\u2019s slamming of the front door.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder!\u201d said Miss Stanley.\r\n\r\nFor a long time she surveyed a row of towering holly-hocks, as though\r\nthey offered an explanation. Then she went in and up-stairs, hesitated\r\non the landing, and finally, a little breathless and with an air of\r\ngreat dignity, opened the door and walked into Ann Veronica\u2019s room. It\r\nwas a neat, efficient-looking room, with a writing-table placed with a\r\nbusiness-like regard to the window, and a bookcase surmounted by a\r\npig\u2019s skull, a dissected frog in a sealed bottle, and a pile of\r\nshiny, black-covered note-books. In the corner of the room were two\r\nhockey-sticks and a tennis-racket, and upon the walls Ann Veronica,\r\nby means of autotypes, had indicated her proclivities in art. But Miss\r\nStanley took no notice of these things. She walked straight across to\r\nthe wardrobe and opened it. There, hanging among Ann Veronica\u2019s more\r\nnormal clothing, was a skimpy dress of red canvas, trimmed with cheap\r\nand tawdry braid, and short--it could hardly reach below the knee. On\r\nthe same peg and evidently belonging to it was a black velvet Zouave\r\njacket. And then! a garment that was conceivably a secondary skirt.\r\n\r\nMiss Stanley hesitated, and took first one and then another of the\r\nconstituents of this costume off its peg and surveyed it.\r\n\r\nThe third item she took with a trembling hand by its waistbelt. As she\r\nraised it, its lower portion fell apart into two baggy crimson masses.\r\n\r\n\u201cTROUSERS!\u201d she whispered.\r\n\r\nHer eyes travelled about the room as if in appeal to the very chairs.\r\n\r\nTucked under the writing-table a pair of yellow and gold Turkish\r\nslippers of a highly meretricious quality caught her eye. She walked\r\nover to them still carrying the trousers in her hands, and stooped to\r\nexamine them. They were ingenious disguises of gilt paper destructively\r\ngummed, it would seem, to Ann Veronicas\u2019 best dancing-slippers.\r\n\r\nThen she reverted to the trousers.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow CAN I tell him?\u201d whispered Miss Stanley.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica carried a light but business-like walking-stick. She walked\r\nwith an easy quickness down the Avenue and through the proletarian\r\nportion of Morningside Park, and crossing these fields came into a\r\npretty overhung lane that led toward Caddington and the Downs. And\r\nthen her pace slackened. She tucked her stick under her arm and re-read\r\nManning\u2019s letter.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me think,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cI wish this hadn\u2019t turned up to-day\r\nof all days.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe found it difficult to begin thinking, and indeed she was anything\r\nbut clear what it was she had to think about. Practically it was most\r\nof the chief interests in life that she proposed to settle in this\r\npedestrian meditation. Primarily it was her own problem, and in\r\nparticular the answer she had to give to Mr. Manning\u2019s letter, but in\r\norder to get data for that she found that she, having a logical and\r\nordered mind, had to decide upon the general relations of men to women,\r\nthe objects and conditions of marriage and its bearing upon the\r\nwelfare of the race, the purpose of the race, the purpose, if any, of\r\neverything....\r\n\r\n\u201cFrightful lot of things aren\u2019t settled,\u201d said Ann Veronica. In\r\naddition, the Fadden Dance business, all out of proportion, occupied\r\nthe whole foreground of her thoughts and threw a color of rebellion\r\nover everything. She kept thinking she was thinking about Mr. Manning\u2019s\r\nproposal of marriage and finding she was thinking of the dance.\r\n\r\nFor a time her efforts to achieve a comprehensive concentration were\r\ndispersed by the passage of the village street of Caddington, the\r\npassing of a goggled car-load of motorists, and the struggles of a\r\nstable lad mounted on one recalcitrant horse and leading another. When\r\nshe got back to her questions again in the monotonous high-road that led\r\nup the hill, she found the image of Mr. Manning central in her mind.\r\nHe stood there, large and dark, enunciating, in his clear voice from\r\nbeneath his large mustache, clear flat sentences, deliberately kindly.\r\nHe proposed, he wanted to possess her! He loved her.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica felt no repulsion at the prospect. That Mr. Manning loved\r\nher presented itself to her bloodlessly, stilled from any imaginative\r\nquiver or thrill of passion or disgust. The relationship seemed to have\r\nalmost as much to do with blood and body as a mortgage. It was something\r\nthat would create a mutual claim, a relationship. It was in another\r\nworld from that in which men will die for a kiss, and touching hands\r\nlights fires that burn up lives--the world of romance, the world of\r\npassionately beautiful things.\r\n\r\nBut that other world, in spite of her resolute exclusion of it, was\r\nalways looking round corners and peeping through chinks and crannies,\r\nand rustling and raiding into the order in which she chose to live,\r\nshining out of pictures at her, echoing in lyrics and music; it invaded\r\nher dreams, it wrote up broken and enigmatical sentences upon the\r\npassage walls of her mind. She was aware of it now as if it were a\r\nvoice shouting outside a house, shouting passionate verities in a hot\r\nsunlight, a voice that cries while people talk insincerely in a darkened\r\nroom and pretend not to hear. Its shouting now did in some occult manner\r\nconvey a protest that Mr. Manning would on no account do, though he\r\nwas tall and dark and handsome and kind, and thirty-five and adequately\r\nprosperous, and all that a husband should be. But there was, it\r\ninsisted, no mobility in his face, no movement, nothing about him that\r\nwarmed. If Ann Veronica could have put words to that song they\r\nwould have been, \u201cHot-blooded marriage or none!\u201d but she was far too\r\nindistinct in this matter to frame any words at all.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t love him,\u201d said Ann Veronica, getting a gleam. \u201cI don\u2019t see\r\nthat his being a good sort matters. That really settles about that....\r\nBut it means no end of a row.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a time she sat on a rail before leaving the road for the downland\r\nturf. \u201cBut I wish,\u201d she said, \u201cI had some idea what I was really up to.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer thoughts went into solution for a time, while she listened to a lark\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\n\u201cMarriage and mothering,\u201d said Ann Veronica, with her mind crystallizing\r\nout again as the lark dropped to the nest in the turf. \u201cAnd all the rest\r\nof it perhaps is a song.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3\r\n\r\n\r\nHer mind got back to the Fadden Ball.\r\n\r\nShe meant to go, she meant to go, she meant to go. Nothing would stop\r\nher, and she was prepared to face the consequences. Suppose her father\r\nturned her out of doors! She did not care, she meant to go. She would\r\njust walk out of the house and go....\r\n\r\nShe thought of her costume in some detail and with considerable\r\nsatisfaction, and particularly of a very jolly property dagger with\r\nlarge glass jewels in the handle, that reposed in a drawer in her room.\r\nShe was to be a Corsair\u2019s Bride. \u201cFancy stabbing a man for jealousy!\u201d\r\n she thought. \u201cYou\u2019d have to think how to get in between his bones.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe thought of her father, and with an effort dismissed him from her\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nShe tried to imagine the collective effect of the Fadden Ball; she had\r\nnever seen a fancy-dress gathering in her life. Mr. Manning came into\r\nher thoughts again, an unexpected, tall, dark, self-contained presence\r\nat the Fadden. One might suppose him turning up; he knew a lot of clever\r\npeople, and some of them might belong to the class. What would he come\r\nas?\r\n\r\nPresently she roused herself with a guilty start from the task of\r\ndressing and re-dressing Mr. Manning in fancy costume, as though he\r\nwas a doll. She had tried him as a Crusader, in which guise he seemed\r\nplausible but heavy--\u201cThere IS something heavy about him; I wonder if\r\nit\u2019s his mustache?\u201d--and as a Hussar, which made him preposterous, and\r\nas a Black Brunswicker, which was better, and as an Arab sheik. Also\r\nshe had tried him as a dragoman and as a gendarme, which seemed the most\r\nsuitable of all to his severely handsome, immobile profile. She felt\r\nhe would tell people the way, control traffic, and refuse admission\r\nto public buildings with invincible correctness and the very finest\r\nexplicit feelings possible. For each costume she had devised a suitable\r\nform of matrimonial refusal. \u201cOh, Lord!\u201d she said, discovering what she\r\nwas up to, and dropped lightly from the fence upon the turf and went on\r\nher way toward the crest.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall never marry,\u201d said Ann Veronica, resolutely; \u201cI\u2019m not the sort.\r\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important I should take my own line now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 4\r\n\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica\u2019s ideas of marriage were limited and unsystematic. Her\r\nteachers and mistresses had done their best to stamp her mind with an\r\nineradicable persuasion that it was tremendously important, and on no\r\naccount to be thought about. Her first intimations of marriage as a fact\r\nof extreme significance in a woman\u2019s life had come with the marriage of\r\nAlice and the elopement of her second sister, Gwen.\r\n\r\nThese convulsions occurred when Ann Veronica was about twelve. There\r\nwas a gulf of eight years between her and the youngest of her brace of\r\nsisters--an impassable gulf inhabited chaotically by two noisy brothers.\r\nThese sisters moved in a grown-up world inaccessible to Ann Veronica\u2019s\r\nsympathies, and to a large extent remote from her curiosity. She got\r\ninto rows through meddling with their shoes and tennis-rackets, and had\r\nmoments of carefully concealed admiration when she was privileged to see\r\nthem just before her bedtime, rather radiantly dressed in white or pink\r\nor amber and prepared to go out with her mother. She thought Alice a bit\r\nof a sneak, an opinion her brothers shared, and Gwen rather a snatch\r\nat meals. She saw nothing of their love-making, and came home from her\r\nboarding-school in a state of decently suppressed curiosity for Alice\u2019s\r\nwedding.\r\n\r\nHer impressions of this cardinal ceremony were rich and confused,\r\ncomplicated by a quite transitory passion that awakened no reciprocal\r\nfire for a fat curly headed cousin in black velveteen and a lace\r\ncollar, who assisted as a page. She followed him about persistently, and\r\nsucceeded, after a brisk, unchivalrous struggle (in which he pinched and\r\nasked her to \u201ccheese it\u201d), in kissing him among the raspberries behind\r\nthe greenhouse. Afterward her brother Roddy, also strange in velveteen,\r\nfeeling rather than knowing of this relationship, punched this Adonis\u2019s\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nA marriage in the house proved to be exciting but extremely\r\ndisorganizing. Everything seemed designed to unhinge the mind and\r\nmake the cat wretched. All the furniture was moved, all the meals were\r\ndisarranged, and everybody, Ann Veronica included, appeared in new,\r\nbright costumes. She had to wear cream and a brown sash and a short\r\nfrock and her hair down, and Gwen cream and a brown sash and a long\r\nskirt and her hair up. And her mother, looking unusually alert and\r\nhectic, wore cream and brown also, made up in a more complicated manner.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica was much impressed by a mighty trying on and altering and\r\nfussing about Alice\u2019s \u201cthings\u201d--Alice was being re-costumed from garret\r\nto cellar, with a walking-dress and walking-boots to measure, and a\r\nbride\u2019s costume of the most ravishing description, and stockings and\r\nsuch like beyond the dreams of avarice--and a constant and increasing\r\ndripping into the house of irrelevant remarkable objects, such as--\r\n\r\nReal lace bedspread;\r\n\r\nGilt travelling clock;\r\n\r\nOrnamental pewter plaque;\r\n\r\nSalad bowl (silver mounted) and servers;\r\n\r\nMadgett\u2019s \u201cEnglish Poets\u201d (twelve volumes), bound purple morocco;\r\n\r\nEtc., etc.\r\n\r\nThrough all this flutter of novelty there came and went a solicitous,\r\npreoccupied, almost depressed figure. It was Doctor Ralph, formerly\r\nthe partner of Doctor Stickell in the Avenue, and now with a thriving\r\npractice of his own in Wamblesmith. He had shaved his side-whiskers and\r\ncome over in flannels, but he was still indisputably the same person\r\nwho had attended Ann Veronica for the measles and when she swallowed\r\nthe fish-bone. But his role was altered, and he was now playing the\r\nbridegroom in this remarkable drama. Alice was going to be Mrs. Ralph.\r\nHe came in apologetically; all the old \u201cWell, and how ARE we?\u201d note\r\ngone; and once he asked Ann Veronica, almost furtively,\r\n\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s Alice getting on, Vee?\u201d Finally, on the Day, he appeared like\r\nhis old professional self transfigured, in the most beautiful light gray\r\ntrousers Ann Veronica had ever seen and a new shiny silk hat with a most\r\nbecoming roll....\r\n\r\nIt was not simply that all the rooms were rearranged and everybody\r\ndressed in unusual fashions, and all the routines of life abolished and\r\nput away: people\u2019s tempers and emotions also seemed strangely disturbed\r\nand shifted about. Her father was distinctly irascible, and disposed\r\nmore than ever to hide away among the petrological things--the study was\r\nturned out. At table he carved in a gloomy but resolute manner. On the\r\nDay he had trumpet-like outbreaks of cordiality, varied by a watchful\r\npreoccupation. Gwen and Alice were fantastically friendly, which seemed\r\nto annoy him, and Mrs. Stanley was throughout enigmatical, with an\r\nanxious eye on her husband and Alice.\r\n\r\nThere was a confused impression of livery carriages and whips with white\r\nfavors, people fussily wanting other people to get in before them,\r\nand then the church. People sat in unusual pews, and a wide margin of\r\nhassocky emptiness intervened between the ceremony and the walls.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica had a number of fragmentary impressions of Alice strangely\r\ntransfigured in bridal raiment. It seemed to make her sister downcast\r\nbeyond any precedent. The bridesmaids and pages got rather jumbled\r\nin the aisle, and she had an effect of Alice\u2019s white back and\r\nsloping shoulders and veiled head receding toward the altar. In some\r\nincomprehensible way that back view made her feel sorry for Alice. Also\r\nshe remembered very vividly the smell of orange blossom, and Alice,\r\ndrooping and spiritless, mumbling responses, facing Doctor Ralph, while\r\nthe Rev. Edward Bribble stood between them with an open book. Doctor\r\nRalph looked kind and large, and listened to Alice\u2019s responses as though\r\nhe was listening to symptoms and thought that on the whole she was\r\nprogressing favorably.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward her mother and Alice kissed long and clung to each other.\r\nAnd Doctor Ralph stood by looking considerate. He and her father shook\r\nhands manfully.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica had got quite interested in Mr. Bribble\u2019s rendering of the\r\nservice--he had the sort of voice that brings out things--and was still\r\nteeming with ideas about it when finally a wild outburst from the organ\r\nmade it clear that, whatever snivelling there might be down in the\r\nchancel, that excellent wind instrument was, in its Mendelssohnian\r\nway, as glad as ever it could be. \u201cPump, pump, per-um-pump, Pum, Pump,\r\nPer-um....\u201d\r\n\r\nThe wedding-breakfast was for Ann Veronica a spectacle of the unreal\r\nconsuming the real; she liked that part very well, until she was\r\ncarelessly served against her expressed wishes with mayonnaise. She\r\nwas caught by an uncle, whose opinion she valued, making faces at Roddy\r\nbecause he had exulted at this.\r\n\r\nOf the vast mass of these impressions Ann Veronica could make nothing\r\nat the time; there they were--Fact! She stored them away in a mind\r\nnaturally retentive, as a squirrel stores away nuts, for further\r\ndigestion. Only one thing emerged with any reasonable clarity in her\r\nmind at once, and that was that unless she was saved from drowning by\r\nan unmarried man, in which case the ceremony is unavoidable, or totally\r\ndestitute of under-clothing, and so driven to get a trousseau, in which\r\nhardship a trousseau would certainly be \u201cripping,\u201d marriage was an\r\nexperience to be strenuously evaded.\r\n\r\nWhen they were going home she asked her mother why she and Gwen and\r\nAlice had cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cSsh!\u201d said her mother, and then added, \u201cA little natural feeling,\r\ndear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut didn\u2019t Alice want to marry Doctor Ralph?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, ssh, Vee!\u201d said her mother, with an evasion as patent as an\r\nadvertisement board. \u201cI am sure she will be very happy indeed with\r\nDoctor Ralph.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Ann Veronica was by no means sure of that until she went over\r\nto Wamblesmith and saw her sister, very remote and domestic and\r\nauthoritative, in a becoming tea-gown, in command of Doctor Ralph\u2019s\r\nhome. Doctor Ralph came in to tea and put his arm round Alice and kissed\r\nher, and Alice called him \u201cSquiggles,\u201d and stood in the shelter of his\r\narms for a moment with an expression of satisfied proprietorship. She\r\nHAD cried, Ann Veronica knew. There had been fusses and scenes dimly\r\napprehended through half-open doors. She had heard Alice talking and\r\ncrying at the same time, a painful noise. Perhaps marriage hurt. But now\r\nit was all over, and Alice was getting on well. It reminded Ann Veronica\r\nof having a tooth stopped.\r\n\r\nAnd after that Alice became remoter than ever, and, after a time, ill.\r\nThen she had a baby and became as old as any really grown-up person, or\r\nolder, and very dull. Then she and her husband went off to a Yorkshire\r\npractice, and had four more babies, none of whom photographed well, and\r\nso she passed beyond the sphere of Ann Veronica\u2019s sympathies altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 5\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gwen affair happened when she was away at school at\r\nMarticombe-on-Sea, a term before she went to the High School, and was\r\nnever very clear to her.\r\n\r\nHer mother missed writing for a week, and then she wrote in an unusual\r\nkey. \u201cMy dear,\u201d the letter ran, \u201cI have to tell you that your sister\r\nGwen has offended your father very much. I hope you will always love\r\nher, but I want you to remember she has offended your father and married\r\nwithout his consent. Your father is very angry, and will not have her\r\nname mentioned in his hearing. She has married some one he could not\r\napprove of, and gone right away....\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen the next holidays came Ann Veronica\u2019s mother was ill, and Gwen was\r\nin the sick-room when Ann Veronica returned home. She was in one of her\r\nold walking-dresses, her hair was done in an unfamiliar manner, she wore\r\na wedding-ring, and she looked as if she had been crying.\r\n\r\n\u201cHello, Gwen!\u201d said Ann Veronica, trying to put every one at their ease.\r\n\u201cBeen and married?... What\u2019s the name of the happy man?\u201d\r\n\r\nGwen owned to \u201cFortescue.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGot a photograph of him or anything?\u201d said Ann Veronica, after kissing\r\nher mother.\r\n\r\nGwen made an inquiry, and, directed by Mrs. Stanley, produced a portrait\r\nfrom its hiding-place in the jewel-drawer under the mirror. It presented\r\na clean-shaven face with a large Corinthian nose, hair tremendously\r\nwaving off the forehead and more chin and neck than is good for a man.\r\n\r\n\u201cLOOKS all right,\u201d said Ann Veronica, regarding him with her head first\r\non one side and then on the other, and trying to be agreeable. \u201cWhat\u2019s\r\nthe objection?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose she ought to know?\u201d said Gwen to her mother, trying to alter\r\nthe key of the conversation.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, Vee,\u201d said Mrs. Stanley, \u201cMr. Fortescue is an actor, and your\r\nfather does not approve of the profession.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cI thought they made knights of actors?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey may of Hal some day,\u201d said Gwen. \u201cBut it\u2019s a long business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose this makes you an actress?\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether I shall go on,\u201d said Gwen, a novel note of\r\nlanguorous professionalism creeping into her voice. \u201cThe other women\r\ndon\u2019t much like it if husband and wife work together, and I don\u2019t think\r\nHal would like me to act away from him.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica regarded her sister with a new respect, but the traditions\r\nof family life are strong. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ll be able to do it\r\nmuch,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\nLater Gwen\u2019s trouble weighed so heavily on Mrs. Stanley in her illness\r\nthat her husband consented to receive Mr. Fortescue in the drawing-room,\r\nand actually shake hands with him in an entirely hopeless manner and\r\nhope everything would turn out for the best.\r\n\r\nThe forgiveness and reconciliation was a cold and formal affair, and\r\nafterwards her father went off gloomily to his study, and Mr. Fortescue\r\nrambled round the garden with soft, propitiatory steps, the Corinthian\r\nnose upraised and his hands behind his back, pausing to look long and\r\nhard at the fruit-trees against the wall.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica watched him from the dining-room window, and after some\r\nmoments of maidenly hesitation rambled out into the garden in a reverse\r\ndirection to Mr. Fortescue\u2019s steps, and encountered him with an air of\r\nartless surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cHello!\u201d said Ann Veronica, with arms akimbo and a careless, breathless\r\nmanner. \u201cYou Mr. Fortescue?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt your service. You Ann Veronica?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRather! I say--did you marry Gwen?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Fortescue raised his eyebrows and assumed a light-comedy expression.\r\n\u201cI suppose I fell in love with her, Ann Veronica.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRum,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cHave you got to keep her now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the best of my ability,\u201d said Mr. Fortescue, with a bow.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you much ability?\u201d asked Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\nMr. Fortescue tried to act embarrassment in order to conceal its\r\nreality, and Ann Veronica went on to ask a string of questions about\r\nacting, and whether her sister would act, and was she beautiful enough\r\nfor it, and who would make her dresses, and so on.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact Mr. Fortescue had not much ability to keep her\r\nsister, and a little while after her mother\u2019s death Ann Veronica\r\nmet Gwen suddenly on the staircase coming from her father\u2019s study,\r\nshockingly dingy in dusty mourning and tearful and resentful, and after\r\nthat Gwen receded from the Morningside Park world, and not even the\r\nbegging letters and distressful communications that her father and aunt\r\nreceived, but only a vague intimation of dreadfulness, a leakage of\r\nincidental comment, flashes of paternal anger at \u201cthat blackguard,\u201d came\r\nto Ann Veronica\u2019s ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 6\r\n\r\n\r\nThese were Ann Veronica\u2019s leading cases in the question of marriage.\r\nThey were the only real marriages she had seen clearly. For the rest,\r\nshe derived her ideas of the married state from the observed behavior of\r\nmarried women, which impressed her in Morningside Park as being tied and\r\ndull and inelastic in comparison with the life of the young, and from a\r\nremarkably various reading among books. As a net result she had come to\r\nthink of all married people much as one thinks of insects that have\r\nlost their wings, and of her sisters as new hatched creatures who had\r\nscarcely for a moment had wings. She evolved a dim image of herself\r\ncooped up in a house under the benevolent shadow of Mr. Manning.\r\nWho knows?--on the analogy of \u201cSquiggles\u201d she might come to call him\r\n\u201cMangles!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can ever marry any one,\u201d she said, and fell suddenly\r\ninto another set of considerations that perplexed her for a time. Had\r\nromance to be banished from life?...\r\n\r\nIt was hard to part with romance, but she had never thirsted so keenly\r\nto go on with her University work in her life as she did that day. She\r\nhad never felt so acutely the desire for free initiative, for a life\r\nunhampered by others. At any cost! Her brothers had it practically--at\r\nleast they had it far more than it seemed likely she would unless she\r\nexerted herself with quite exceptional vigor. Between her and the fair,\r\nfar prospect of freedom and self-development manoeuvred Mr. Manning, her\r\naunt and father, neighbors, customs, traditions, forces. They seemed to\r\nher that morning to be all armed with nets and prepared to throw them\r\nover her directly her movements became in any manner truly free.\r\n\r\nShe had a feeling as though something had dropped from her eyes, as\r\nthough she had just discovered herself for the first time--discovered\r\nherself as a sleep-walker might do, abruptly among dangers, hindrances,\r\nand perplexities, on the verge of a cardinal crisis.\r\n\r\nThe life of a girl presented itself to her as something happy and\r\nheedless and unthinking, yet really guided and controlled by others, and\r\ngoing on amidst unsuspected screens and concealments.\r\n\r\nAnd in its way it was very well. Then suddenly with a rush came reality,\r\ncame \u201cgrowing up\u201d; a hasty imperative appeal for seriousness, for\r\nsupreme seriousness. The Ralphs and Mannings and Fortescues came down\r\nupon the raw inexperience, upon the blinking ignorance of the newcomer;\r\nand before her eyes were fairly open, before she knew what had\r\nhappened, a new set of guides and controls, a new set of obligations and\r\nresponsibilities and limitations, had replaced the old. \u201cI want to be\r\na Person,\u201d said Ann Veronica to the downs and the open sky; \u201cI will not\r\nhave this happen to me, whatever else may happen in its place.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica had three things very definitely settled by the time when,\r\na little after mid-day, she found herself perched up on a gate between a\r\nbridle-path and a field that commanded the whole wide stretch of country\r\nbetween Chalking and Waldersham. Firstly, she did not intend to marry at\r\nall, and particularly she did not mean to marry Mr. Manning; secondly,\r\nby some measure or other, she meant to go on with her studies, not at\r\nthe Tredgold Schools but at the Imperial College; and, thirdly, she was,\r\nas an immediate and decisive act, a symbol of just exactly where she\r\nstood, a declaration of free and adult initiative, going that night to\r\nthe Fadden Ball.\r\n\r\nBut the possible attitude of her father she had still to face. So far\r\nshe had the utmost difficulty in getting on to that vitally important\r\nmatter. The whole of that relationship persisted in remaining obscure.\r\nWhat would happen when next morning she returned to Morningside Park?\r\n\r\nHe couldn\u2019t turn her out of doors. But what he could do or might do she\r\ncould not imagine. She was not afraid of violence, but she was afraid of\r\nsomething mean, some secondary kind of force. Suppose he stopped all her\r\nallowance, made it imperative that she should either stay ineffectually\r\nresentful at home or earn a living for herself at once.... It\r\nappeared highly probable to her that he would stop her allowance.\r\n\r\nWhat can a girl do?\r\n\r\nSomewhere at this point Ann Veronica\u2019s speculations were interrupted\r\nand turned aside by the approach of a horse and rider. Mr. Ramage, that\r\niron-gray man of the world, appeared dressed in a bowler hat and a suit\r\nof hard gray, astride of a black horse. He pulled rein at the sight of\r\nher, saluted, and regarded her with his rather too protuberant eyes. The\r\ngirl\u2019s gaze met his in interested inquiry.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got my view,\u201d he said, after a pensive second. \u201cI always get off\r\nhere and lean over that rail for a bit. May I do so to-day?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s your gate,\u201d she said, amiably; \u201cyou got it first. It\u2019s for you to\r\nsay if I may sit on it.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe slipped off the horse. \u201cLet me introduce you to Caesar,\u201d he said;\r\nand she patted Caesar\u2019s neck, and remarked how soft his nose was, and\r\nsecretly deplored the ugliness of equine teeth. Ramage tethered the\r\nhorse to the farther gate-post, and Caesar blew heavily and began to\r\ninvestigate the hedge.\r\n\r\nRamage leaned over the gate at Ann Veronica\u2019s side, and for a moment\r\nthere was silence.\r\n\r\nHe made some obvious comments on the wide view warming toward its\r\nautumnal blaze that spread itself in hill and valley, wood and village,\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s as broad as life,\u201d said Mr. Ramage, regarding it and putting a\r\nwell-booted foot up on the bottom rail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 7\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what are you doing here, young lady,\u201d he said, looking up at her\r\nface, \u201cwandering alone so far from home?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI like long walks,\u201d said Ann Veronica, looking down on him.\r\n\r\n\u201cSolitary walks?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the point of them. I think over all sorts of things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cProblems?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSometimes quite difficult problems.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky to live in an age when you can do so. Your mother,\r\nfor instance, couldn\u2019t. She had to do her thinking at home--under\r\ninspection.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe looked down on him thoughtfully, and he let his admiration of her\r\nfree young poise show in his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose things have changed?\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever was such an age of transition.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe wondered what to. Mr. Ramage did not know. \u201cSufficient unto me is\r\nthe change thereof,\u201d he said, with all the effect of an epigram.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must confess,\u201d he said, \u201cthe New Woman and the New Girl intrigue me\r\nprofoundly. I am one of those people who are interested in women, more\r\ninterested than I am in anything else. I don\u2019t conceal it. And the\r\nchange, the change of attitude! The way all the old clingingness\r\nhas been thrown aside is amazing. And all the old--the old trick of\r\nshrinking up like a snail at a touch. If you had lived twenty years ago\r\nyou would have been called a Young Person, and it would have been your\r\nchief duty in life not to know, never to have heard of, and never to\r\nunderstand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s quite enough still,\u201d said Ann Veronica, smiling, \u201cthat one\r\ndoesn\u2019t understand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite. But your role would have been to go about saying, \u2018I beg your\r\npardon\u2019 in a reproving tone to things you understood quite well in your\r\nheart and saw no harm in. That terrible Young Person! she\u2019s vanished.\r\nLost, stolen, or strayed, the Young Person!... I hope we may never\r\nfind her again.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe rejoiced over this emancipation. \u201cWhile that lamb was about every man\r\nof any spirit was regarded as a dangerous wolf. We wore invisible chains\r\nand invisible blinkers. Now, you and I can gossip at a gate, and Honi\r\nsoit qui mal y pense. The change has given man one good thing he never\r\nhad before,\u201d he said. \u201cGirl friends. And I am coming to believe the best\r\nas well as the most beautiful friends a man can have are girl friends.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe paused, and went on, after a keen look at her:\r\n\r\n\u201cI had rather gossip to a really intelligent girl than to any man\r\nalive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose we ARE more free than we were?\u201d said Ann Veronica, keeping\r\nthe question general.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, there\u2019s no doubt of it! Since the girls of the eighties broke\r\nbounds and sailed away on bicycles--my young days go back to the very\r\nbeginnings of that--it\u2019s been one triumphant relaxation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRelaxation, perhaps. But are we any more free?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI mean we\u2019ve long strings to tether us, but we are bound all the same.\r\nA woman isn\u2019t much freer--in reality.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Ramage demurred.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne runs about,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s on condition one doesn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!--anything.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked interrogation with a faint smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me it comes to earning one\u2019s living in the long run,\u201d said\r\nAnn Veronica, coloring faintly. \u201cUntil a girl can go away as a son does\r\nand earn her independent income, she\u2019s still on a string. It may be a\r\nlong string, long enough if you like to tangle up all sorts of people;\r\nbut there it is! If the paymaster pulls, home she must go. That\u2019s what I\r\nmean.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Ramage admitted the force of that. He was a little impressed by\r\nAnn Veronica\u2019s metaphor of the string, which, indeed, she owed to Hetty\r\nWidgett. \u201cYOU wouldn\u2019t like to be independent?\u201d he asked, abruptly. \u201cI\r\nmean REALLY independent. On your own. It isn\u2019t such fun as it seems.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery one wants to be independent,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cEvery one. Man\r\nor woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRather!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no why. It\u2019s just to feel--one owns one\u2019s self.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNobody does that,\u201d said Ramage, and kept silence for a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut a boy--a boy goes out into the world and presently stands on his\r\nown feet. He buys his own clothes, chooses his own company, makes his\r\nown way of living.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d like to do that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you like to be a boy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder! It\u2019s out of the question, any way.\u201d\r\n\r\nRamage reflected. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it might mean rather a row.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know--\u201d said Ramage, with sympathy.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd besides,\u201d said Ann Veronica, sweeping that aspect aside, \u201cwhat\r\ncould I do? A boy sails out into a trade or profession. But--it\u2019s one\r\nof the things I\u2019ve just been thinking over. Suppose--suppose a girl\r\ndid want to start in life, start in life for herself--\u201d She looked him\r\nfrankly in the eyes. \u201cWhat ought she to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuppose you--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, suppose I--\u201d\r\n\r\nHe felt that his advice was being asked. He became a little more\r\npersonal and intimate. \u201cI wonder what you could do?\u201d he said. \u201cI should\r\nthink YOU could do all sorts of things....\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat ought you to do?\u201d He began to produce his knowledge of the world\r\nfor her benefit, jerkily and allusively, and with a strong, rank flavor\r\nof \u201csavoir faire.\u201d He took an optimist view of her chances. Ann Veronica\r\nlistened thoughtfully, with her eyes on the turf, and now and then she\r\nasked a question or looked up to discuss a point. In the meanwhile,\r\nas he talked, he scrutinized her face, ran his eyes over her careless,\r\ngracious poise, wondered hard about her. He described her privately to\r\nhimself as a splendid girl. It was clear she wanted to get away from\r\nhome, that she was impatient to get away from home. Why? While the front\r\nof his mind was busy warning her not to fall into the hopeless miseries\r\nof underpaid teaching, and explaining his idea that for women of\r\ninitiative, quite as much as for men, the world of business had by far\r\nthe best chances, the back chambers of his brain were busy with the\r\nproblem of that \u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\nHis first idea as a man of the world was to explain her unrest by a\r\nlover, some secret or forbidden or impossible lover. But he dismissed\r\nthat because then she would ask her lover and not him all these things.\r\nRestlessness, then, was the trouble, simple restlessness: home bored\r\nher. He could quite understand the daughter of Mr. Stanley being bored\r\nand feeling limited. But was that enough? Dim, formless suspicions\r\nof something more vital wandered about his mind. Was the young lady\r\nimpatient for experience? Was she adventurous? As a man of the world he\r\ndid not think it becoming to accept maidenly calm as anything more than\r\na mask. Warm life was behind that always, even if it slept. If it\r\nwas not an actual personal lover, it still might be the lover not yet\r\nincarnate, not yet perhaps suspected....\r\n\r\nHe had diverged only a little from the truth when he said that his\r\nchief interest in life was women. It wasn\u2019t so much women as Woman that\r\nengaged his mind. His was the Latin turn of thinking; he had fallen\r\nin love at thirteen, and he was still capable--he prided himself--of\r\nfalling in love. His invalid wife and her money had been only the thin\r\nthread that held his life together; beaded on that permanent relation\r\nhad been an inter-weaving series of other feminine experiences,\r\ndisturbing, absorbing, interesting, memorable affairs. Each one had\r\nbeen different from the others, each had had a quality all its own, a\r\ndistinctive freshness, a distinctive beauty. He could not understand how\r\nmen could live ignoring this one predominant interest, this wonderful\r\nresearch into personality and the possibilities of pleasing, these\r\ncomplex, fascinating expeditions that began in interest and mounted to\r\nthe supremest, most passionate intimacy. All the rest of his existence\r\nwas subordinate to this pursuit; he lived for it, worked for it, kept\r\nhimself in training for it.\r\n\r\nSo while he talked to this girl of work and freedom, his slightly\r\nprotuberant eyes were noting the gracious balance of her limbs and body\r\nacross the gate, the fine lines of her chin and neck. Her grave fine\r\nface, her warm clear complexion, had already aroused his curiosity as he\r\nhad gone to and fro in Morningside Park, and here suddenly he was\r\nnear to her and talking freely and intimately. He had found her in\r\na communicative mood, and he used the accumulated skill of years in\r\nturning that to account.\r\n\r\nShe was pleased and a little flattered by his interest and sympathy. She\r\nbecame eager to explain herself, to show herself in the right light. He\r\nwas manifestly exerting his mind for her, and she found herself fully\r\ndisposed to justify his interest.\r\n\r\nShe, perhaps, displayed herself rather consciously as a fine\r\nperson unduly limited. She even touched lightly on her father\u2019s\r\nunreasonableness.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d said Ramage, \u201cthat more girls don\u2019t think as you do and want\r\nto strike out in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd then he speculated. \u201cI wonder if you will?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me say one thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf ever you do and I can help you\r\nin any way, by advice or inquiry or recommendation--You see, I\u2019m no\r\nbeliever in feminine incapacity, but I do perceive there is such a thing\r\nas feminine inexperience. As a sex you\u2019re a little under-trained--in\r\naffairs. I\u2019d take it--forgive me if I seem a little urgent--as a sort of\r\nproof of friendliness. I can imagine nothing more pleasant in life than\r\nto help you, because I know it would pay to help you. There\u2019s something\r\nabout you, a little flavor of Will, I suppose, that makes one feel--good\r\nluck about you and success....\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd while he talked and watched her as he talked, she answered, and\r\nbehind her listening watched and thought about him. She liked the\r\nanimated eagerness of his manner.\r\n\r\nHis mind seemed to be a remarkably full one; his knowledge of detailed\r\nreality came in just where her own mind was most weakly equipped.\r\nThrough all he said ran one quality that pleased her--the quality of a\r\nman who feels that things can be done, that one need not wait for the\r\nworld to push one before one moved. Compared with her father and Mr.\r\nManning and the men in \u201cfixed\u201d positions generally that she knew,\r\nRamage, presented by himself, had a fine suggestion of freedom, of\r\npower, of deliberate and sustained adventure....\r\n\r\nShe was particularly charmed by his theory of friendship. It was really\r\nvery jolly to talk to a man in this way--who saw the woman in her and\r\ndid not treat her as a child. She was inclined to think that perhaps\r\nfor a girl the converse of his method was the case; an older man, a\r\nman beyond the range of anything \u201cnonsensical,\u201d was, perhaps, the most\r\ninteresting sort of friend one could meet. But in that reservation it\r\nmay be she went a little beyond the converse of his view....\r\n\r\nThey got on wonderfully well together. They talked for the better part\r\nof an hour, and at last walked together to the junction of highroad\r\nand the bridle-path. There, after protestations of friendliness and\r\nhelpfulness that were almost ardent, he mounted a little clumsily and\r\nrode off at an amiable pace, looking his best, making a leg with\r\nhis riding gaiters, smiling and saluting, while Ann Veronica turned\r\nnorthward and so came to Micklechesil. There, in a little tea and\r\nsweet-stuff shop, she bought and consumed slowly and absent-mindedly the\r\ninsufficient nourishment that is natural to her sex on such occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FOURTH\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 1\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left Miss Stanley with Ann Veronica\u2019s fancy dress in her hands and\r\nher eyes directed to Ann Veronica\u2019s pseudo-Turkish slippers.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Stanley came home at a quarter to six--an earlier train by\r\nfifteen minutes than he affected--his sister met him in the hall with\r\na hushed expression. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here, Peter,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\r\nmeans to go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo!\u201d he said. \u201cWhere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo that ball.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat ball?\u201d The question was rhetorical. He knew.\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe she\u2019s dressing up-stairs--now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen tell her to undress, confound her!\u201d The City had been thoroughly\r\nannoying that day, and he was angry from the outset.\r\n\r\nMiss Stanley reflected on this proposal for a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she will,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe must,\u201d said Mr. Stanley, and went into his study. His sister\r\nfollowed. \u201cShe can\u2019t go now. She\u2019ll have to wait for dinner,\u201d he said,\r\nuncomfortably.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to have some sort of meal with the Widgetts down the\r\nAvenue, and go up with them.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe told you that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt tea.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you prohibit once for all the whole thing? How dared she\r\ntell you that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOut of defiance. She just sat and told me that was her arrangement.\r\nI\u2019ve never seen her quite so sure of herself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI said, \u2018My dear Veronica! how can you think of such things?\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe had two more cups of tea and some cake, and told me of her walk.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll meet somebody one of these days--walking about like that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t say she\u2019d met any one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut didn\u2019t you say some more about that ball?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI said everything I could say as soon as I realized she was trying to\r\navoid the topic. I said, \u2018It is no use your telling me about this walk\r\nand pretend I\u2019ve been told about the ball, because you haven\u2019t. Your\r\nfather has forbidden you to go!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe said, \u2018I hate being horrid to you and father, but I feel it my duty\r\nto go to that ball!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFelt it her duty!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Very well,\u2019 I said, \u2018then I wash my hands of the whole business. Your\r\ndisobedience be upon your own head.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut that is flat rebellion!\u201d said Mr. Stanley, standing on the\r\nhearthrug with his back to the unlit gas-fire. \u201cYou ought at once--you\r\nought at once to have told her that. What duty does a girl owe to any\r\none before her father? Obedience to him, that is surely the first law.\r\nWhat CAN she put before that?\u201d His voice began to rise. \u201cOne would think\r\nI had said nothing about the matter. One would think I had agreed to\r\nher going. I suppose this is what she learns in her infernal London\r\ncolleges. I suppose this is the sort of damned rubbish--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! Ssh, Peter!\u201d cried Miss Stanley.\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly. In the pause a door could be heard opening and\r\nclosing on the landing up-stairs. Then light footsteps became audible,\r\ndescending the staircase with a certain deliberation and a faint rustle\r\nof skirts.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell her,\u201d said Mr. Stanley, with an imperious gesture, \u201cto come in\r\nhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Stanley emerged from the study and stood watching Ann Veronica\r\ndescend.\r\n\r\nThe girl was flushed with excitement, bright-eyed, and braced for a\r\nstruggle; her aunt had never seen her looking so fine or so pretty.\r\nHer fancy dress, save for the green-gray stockings, the pseudo-Turkish\r\nslippers, and baggy silk trousered ends natural to a Corsair\u2019s bride,\r\nwas hidden in a large black-silk-hooded opera-cloak. Beneath the hood\r\nit was evident that her rebellious hair was bound up with red silk, and\r\nfastened by some device in her ears (unless she had them pierced, which\r\nwas too dreadful a thing to suppose!) were long brass filigree earrings.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just off, aunt,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour father is in the study and wishes to speak to you.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica hesitated, and then stood in the open doorway and regarded\r\nher father\u2019s stern presence. She spoke with an entirely false note of\r\ncheerful off-handedness. \u201cI\u2019m just in time to say good-bye before I go,\r\nfather. I\u2019m going up to London with the Widgetts to that ball.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow look here, Ann Veronica,\u201d said Mr. Stanley, \u201cjust a moment. You are\r\nNOT going to that ball!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica tried a less genial, more dignified note.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought we had discussed that, father.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are not going to that ball! You are not going out of this house in\r\nthat get-up!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica tried yet more earnestly to treat him, as she would treat\r\nany man, with an insistence upon her due of masculine respect. \u201cYou\r\nsee,\u201d she said, very gently, \u201cI AM going. I am sorry to seem to disobey\r\nyou, but I am. I wish\u201d--she found she had embarked on a bad sentence--\u201cI\r\nwish we needn\u2019t have quarrelled.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stopped abruptly, and turned about toward the front door. In a\r\nmoment he was beside her. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can have heard me, Vee,\u201d\r\n he said, with intensely controlled fury. \u201cI said you were\u201d--he\r\nshouted--\u201cNOT TO GO!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe made, and overdid, an immense effort to be a princess. She tossed\r\nher head, and, having no further words, moved toward the door. Her\r\nfather intercepted her, and for a moment she and he struggled with their\r\nhands upon the latch. A common rage flushed their faces. \u201cLet go!\u201d she\r\ngasped at him, a blaze of anger.\r\n\r\n\u201cVeronica!\u201d cried Miss Stanley, warningly, and, \u201cPeter!\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment they seemed on the verge of an altogether desperate\r\nscuffle. Never for a moment had violence come between these two since\r\nlong ago he had, in spite of her mother\u2019s protest in the background,\r\ncarried her kicking and squalling to the nursery for some forgotten\r\ncrime. With something near to horror they found themselves thus\r\nconfronted.\r\n\r\nThe door was fastened by a catch and a latch with an inside key, to\r\nwhich at night a chain and two bolts were added. Carefully abstaining\r\nfrom thrusting against each other, Ann Veronica and her father began an\r\nabsurdly desperate struggle, the one to open the door, the other to keep\r\nit fastened. She seized the key, and he grasped her hand and squeezed\r\nit roughly and painfully between the handle and the ward as she tried to\r\nturn it. His grip twisted her wrist. She cried out with the pain of it.\r\n\r\nA wild passion of shame and self-disgust swept over her. Her spirit\r\nawoke in dismay to an affection in ruins, to the immense undignified\r\ndisaster that had come to them.\r\n\r\nAbruptly she desisted, recoiled, and turned and fled up-stairs.\r\n\r\nShe made noises between weeping and laughter as she went. She gained her\r\nroom, and slammed her door and locked it as though she feared violence\r\nand pursuit.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh God!\u201d she cried, \u201cOh God!\u201d and flung aside her opera-cloak, and for\r\na time walked about the room--a Corsair\u2019s bride at a crisis of emotion.\r\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t he reason with me,\u201d she said, again and again, \u201cinstead of\r\ndoing this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3\r\n\r\n\r\nThere presently came a phase in which she said: \u201cI WON\u2019T stand it even\r\nnow. I will go to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe went as far as her door, then turned to the window. She opened\r\nthis and scrambled out--a thing she had not done for five long years of\r\nadolescence--upon the leaded space above the built-out bath-room on the\r\nfirst floor. Once upon a time she and Roddy had descended thence by the\r\ndrain-pipe.\r\n\r\nBut things that a girl of sixteen may do in short skirts are not\r\nthings to be done by a young lady of twenty-one in fancy dress and\r\nan opera-cloak, and just as she was coming unaided to an adequate\r\nrealization of this, she discovered Mr. Pragmar, the wholesale druggist,\r\nwho lived three gardens away, and who had been mowing his lawn to get\r\nan appetite for dinner, standing in a fascinated attitude beside the\r\nforgotten lawn-mower and watching her intently.\r\n\r\nShe found it extremely difficult to infuse an air of quiet correctitude\r\ninto her return through the window, and when she was safely inside she\r\nwaved clinched fists and executed a noiseless dance of rage.\r\n\r\nWhen she reflected that Mr. Pragmar probably knew Mr. Ramage, and might\r\ndescribe the affair to him, she cried \u201cOh!\u201d with renewed vexation, and\r\nrepeated some steps of her dance in a new and more ecstatic measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 4\r\n\r\n\r\nAt eight that evening Miss Stanley tapped at Ann Veronica\u2019s bedroom\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve brought you up some dinner, Vee,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica was lying on her bed in a darkling room staring at the\r\nceiling. She reflected before answering. She was frightfully hungry.\r\nShe had eaten little or no tea, and her mid-day meal had been worse than\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nShe got up and unlocked the door.\r\n\r\nHer aunt did not object to capital punishment or war, or the industrial\r\nsystem or casual wards, or flogging of criminals or the Congo Free\r\nState, because none of these things really got hold of her imagination;\r\nbut she did object, she did not like, she could not bear to think of\r\npeople not having and enjoying their meals. It was her distinctive test\r\nof an emotional state, its interference with a kindly normal digestion.\r\nAny one very badly moved choked down a few mouthfuls; the symptom of\r\nsupreme distress was not to be able to touch a bit. So that the thought\r\nof Ann Veronica up-stairs had been extremely painful for her through all\r\nthe silent dinner-time that night. As soon as dinner was over she went\r\ninto the kitchen and devoted herself to compiling a tray--not a tray\r\nmerely of half-cooled dinner things, but a specially prepared \u201cnice\u201d\r\n tray, suitable for tempting any one. With this she now entered.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica found herself in the presence of the most disconcerting\r\nfact in human experience, the kindliness of people you believe to be\r\nthoroughly wrong. She took the tray with both hands, gulped, and gave\r\nway to tears.\r\n\r\nHer aunt leaped unhappily to the thought of penitence.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d she began, with an affectionate hand on Ann Veronica\u2019s\r\nshoulder, \u201cI do SO wish you would realize how it grieves your father.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica flung away from her hand, and the pepper-pot on the tray\r\nupset, sending a puff of pepper into the air and instantly filling them\r\nboth with an intense desire to sneeze.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you see,\u201d she replied, with tears on her cheeks, and her\r\nbrows knitting, \u201chow it shames and, ah!--disgraces me--AH TISHU!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe put down the tray with a concussion on her toilet-table.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, dear, think! He is your father. SHOOH!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s no reason,\u201d said Ann Veronica, speaking through her handkerchief\r\nand stopping abruptly.\r\n\r\nNiece and aunt regarded each other for a moment over their\r\npocket-handkerchiefs with watery but antagonistic eyes, each far too\r\nprofoundly moved to see the absurdity of the position.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope,\u201d said Miss Stanley, with dignity, and turned doorward with\r\nfeatures in civil warfare. \u201cBetter state of mind,\u201d she gasped....\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica stood in the twilight room staring at the door that had\r\nslammed upon her aunt, her pocket-handkerchief rolled tightly in her\r\nhand. Her soul was full of the sense of disaster. She had made her first\r\nfight for dignity and freedom as a grown-up and independent Person, and\r\nthis was how the universe had treated her. It had neither succumbed\r\nto her nor wrathfully overwhelmed her. It had thrust her back with an\r\nundignified scuffle, with vulgar comedy, with an unendurable, scornful\r\ngrin.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy God!\u201d said Ann Veronica for the first time in her life. \u201cBut I will!\r\nI will!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIFTH\r\n\r\nTHE FLIGHT TO LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 1\r\n\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica had an impression that she did not sleep at all that night,\r\nand at any rate she got through an immense amount of feverish feeling\r\nand thinking.\r\n\r\nWhat was she going to do?\r\n\r\nOne main idea possessed her: she must get away from home, she must\r\nassert herself at once or perish. \u201cVery well,\u201d she would say, \u201cthen I\r\nmust go.\u201d To remain, she felt, was to concede everything. And she would\r\nhave to go to-morrow. It was clear it must be to-morrow. If she delayed\r\na day she would delay two days, if she delayed two days she would delay\r\na week, and after a week things would be adjusted to submission forever.\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d she vowed to the night, \u201cor I\u2019ll die!\u201d She made plans and\r\nestimated means and resources. These and her general preparations had\r\nperhaps a certain disproportion. She had a gold watch, a very good gold\r\nwatch that had been her mother\u2019s, a pearl necklace that was also pretty\r\ngood, some unpretending rings, some silver bangles and a few other such\r\ninferior trinkets, three pounds thirteen shillings unspent of her\r\ndress and book allowance and a few good salable books. So equipped, she\r\nproposed to set up a separate establishment in the world.\r\n\r\nAnd then she would find work.\r\n\r\nFor most of a long and fluctuating night she was fairly confident that\r\nshe would find work; she knew herself to be strong, intelligent, and\r\ncapable by the standards of most of the girls she knew. She was not\r\nquite clear how she should find it, but she felt she would. Then\r\nshe would write and tell her father what she had done, and put their\r\nrelationship on a new footing.\r\n\r\nThat was how she projected it, and in general terms it seemed plausible\r\nand possible. But in between these wider phases of comparative\r\nconfidence were gaps of disconcerting doubt, when the universe was\r\npresented as making sinister and threatening faces at her, defying her\r\nto defy, preparing a humiliating and shameful overthrow. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d\r\n said Ann Veronica to the darkness; \u201cI\u2019ll fight it.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe tried to plan her proceedings in detail. The only difficulties that\r\npresented themselves clearly to her were the difficulties of getting\r\naway from Morningside Park, and not the difficulties at the other end\r\nof the journey. These were so outside her experience that she found it\r\npossible to thrust them almost out of sight by saying they would be \u201call\r\nright\u201d in confident tones to herself. But still she knew they were not\r\nright, and at times they became a horrible obsession as of something\r\nwaiting for her round the corner. She tried to imagine herself \u201cgetting\r\nsomething,\u201d to project herself as sitting down at a desk and writing,\r\nor as returning after her work to some pleasantly equipped and free and\r\nindependent flat. For a time she furnished the flat. But even with\r\nthat furniture it remained extremely vague, the possible good and the\r\npossible evil as well!\r\n\r\nThe possible evil! \u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d said Ann Veronica for the hundredth time.\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go. I don\u2019t care WHAT happens.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe awoke out of a doze, as though she had never been sleeping. It was\r\ntime to get up.\r\n\r\nShe sat on the edge of her bed and looked about her, at her room, at the\r\nrow of black-covered books and the pig\u2019s skull. \u201cI must take them,\u201d\r\n she said, to help herself over her own incredulity. \u201cHow shall I get my\r\nluggage out of the house?...\u201d\r\n\r\nThe figure of her aunt, a little distant, a little propitiatory, behind\r\nthe coffee things, filled her with a sense of almost catastrophic\r\nadventure. Perhaps she might never come back to that breakfast-room\r\nagain. Never! Perhaps some day, quite soon, she might regret that\r\nbreakfast-room. She helped herself to the remainder of the slightly\r\ncongealed bacon, and reverted to the problem of getting her luggage\r\nout of the house. She decided to call in the help of Teddy Widgett, or,\r\nfailing him, of one of his sisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\n\r\nShe found the younger generation of the Widgetts engaged in languid\r\nreminiscences, and all, as they expressed it, a \u201cbit decayed.\u201d Every\r\none became tremendously animated when they heard that Ann Veronica had\r\nfailed them because she had been, as she expressed it, \u201clocked in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God!\u201d said Teddy, more impressively than ever.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what are you going to do?\u201d asked Hetty.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can one do?\u201d asked Ann Veronica. \u201cWould you stand it? I\u2019m going to\r\nclear out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cClear out?\u201d cried Hetty.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo to London,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\nShe had expected sympathetic admiration, but instead the whole Widgett\r\nfamily, except Teddy, expressed a common dismay. \u201cBut how can you?\u201d\r\n asked Constance. \u201cWho will you stop with?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall go on my own. Take a room!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI say!\u201d said Constance. \u201cBut who\u2019s going to pay for the room?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got money,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cAnything is better than this--this\r\nstifled life down here.\u201d And seeing that Hetty and Constance were\r\nobviously developing objections, she plunged at once into a demand for\r\nhelp. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing in the world to pack with except a toy size\r\nportmanteau. Can you lend me some stuff?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou ARE a chap!\u201d said Constance, and warmed only slowly from the idea\r\nof dissuasion to the idea of help. But they did what they could for her.\r\nThey agreed to lend her their hold-all and a large, formless bag which\r\nthey called the communal trunk. And Teddy declared himself ready to go\r\nto the ends of the earth for her, and carry her luggage all the way.\r\n\r\nHetty, looking out of the window--she always smoked her after-breakfast\r\ncigarette at the window for the benefit of the less advanced section of\r\nMorningside Park society--and trying not to raise objections, saw Miss\r\nStanley going down toward the shops.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you must go on with it,\u201d said Hetty, \u201cnow\u2019s your time.\u201d And Ann\r\nVeronica at once went back with the hold-all, trying not to hurry\r\nindecently but to keep up her dignified air of being a wronged person\r\ndoing the right thing at a smart trot, to pack. Teddy went round by the\r\ngarden backs and dropped the bag over the fence. All this was exciting\r\nand entertaining. Her aunt returned before the packing was done, and\r\nAnn Veronica lunched with an uneasy sense of bag and hold-all packed\r\nup-stairs and inadequately hidden from chance intruders by the valance\r\nof the bed. She went down, flushed and light-hearted, to the Widgetts\u2019\r\nafter lunch to make some final arrangements and then, as soon as her\r\naunt had retired to lie down for her usual digestive hour, took the\r\nrisk of the servants having the enterprise to report her proceedings\r\nand carried her bag and hold-all to the garden gate, whence Teddy, in\r\na state of ecstatic service, bore them to the railway station. Then she\r\nwent up-stairs again, dressed herself carefully for town, put on her\r\nmost businesslike-looking hat, and with a wave of emotion she found it\r\nhard to control, walked down to catch the 3.17 up-train.\r\n\r\nTeddy handed her into the second-class compartment her season-ticket\r\nwarranted, and declared she was \u201csimply splendid.\u201d \u201cIf you want\r\nanything,\u201d he said, \u201cor get into any trouble, wire me. I\u2019d come back\r\nfrom the ends of the earth. I\u2019d do anything, Vee. It\u2019s horrible to think\r\nof you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re an awful brick, Teddy!\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t be for you?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe train began to move. \u201cYou\u2019re splendid!\u201d said Teddy, with his hair\r\nwild in the wind. \u201cGood luck! Good luck!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe waved from the window until the bend hid him.\r\n\r\nShe found herself alone in the train asking herself what she must do\r\nnext, and trying not to think of herself as cut off from home or any\r\nrefuge whatever from the world she had resolved to face. She felt\r\nsmaller and more adventurous even than she had expected to feel. \u201cLet\r\nme see,\u201d she said to herself, trying to control a slight sinking of the\r\nheart, \u201cI am going to take a room in a lodging-house because that is\r\ncheaper.... But perhaps I had better get a room in an hotel to-night\r\nand look round....\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s bound to be all right,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\nBut her heart kept on sinking. What hotel should she go to? If she told\r\na cabman to drive to an hotel, any hotel, what would he do--or say? He\r\nmight drive to something dreadfully expensive, and not at all the quiet\r\nsort of thing she required. Finally she decided that even for an hotel\r\nshe must look round, and that meanwhile she would \u201cbook\u201d her luggage at\r\nWaterloo. She told the porter to take it to the booking-office, and it\r\nwas only after a disconcerting moment or so that she found she ought to\r\nhave directed him to go to the cloak-room. But that was soon put right,\r\nand she walked out into London with a peculiar exaltation of mind, an\r\nexaltation that partook of panic and defiance, but was chiefly a sense\r\nof vast unexampled release.\r\n\r\nShe inhaled a deep breath of air--London air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3\r\n\r\n\r\nShe dismissed the first hotels she passed, she scarcely knew why, mainly\r\nperhaps from the mere dread of entering them, and crossed Waterloo\r\nBridge at a leisurely pace. It was high afternoon, there was no great\r\nthrong of foot-passengers, and many an eye from omnibus and pavement\r\nrested gratefully on her fresh, trim presence as she passed young\r\nand erect, with the light of determination shining through the quiet\r\nself-possession of her face. She was dressed as English girls do dress\r\nfor town, without either coquetry or harshness: her collarless blouse\r\nconfessed a pretty neck, her eyes were bright and steady, and her dark\r\nhair waved loosely and graciously over her ears....\r\n\r\nIt seemed at first the most beautiful afternoon of all time to her,\r\nand perhaps the thrill of her excitement did add a distinctive and\r\nculminating keenness to the day. The river, the big buildings on the\r\nnorth bank, Westminster, and St. Paul\u2019s, were rich and wonderful with\r\nthe soft sunshine of London, the softest, the finest grained, the most\r\npenetrating and least emphatic sunshine in the world. The very carts\r\nand vans and cabs that Wellington Street poured out incessantly upon\r\nthe bridge seemed ripe and good in her eyes. A traffic of copious barges\r\nslumbered over the face of the river-barges either altogether stagnant\r\nor dreaming along in the wake of fussy tugs; and above circled, urbanely\r\nvoracious, the London seagulls. She had never been there before at that\r\nhour, in that light, and it seemed to her as if she came to it all for\r\nthe first time. And this great mellow place, this London, now was hers,\r\nto struggle with, to go where she pleased in, to overcome and live in.\r\n\u201cI am glad,\u201d she told herself, \u201cI came.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe marked an hotel that seemed neither opulent nor odd in a little side\r\nstreet opening on the Embankment, made up her mind with an effort, and,\r\nreturning by Hungerford Bridge to Waterloo, took a cab to this chosen\r\nrefuge with her two pieces of luggage. There was just a minute\u2019s\r\nhesitation before they gave her a room.\r\n\r\nThe young lady in the bureau said she would inquire, and Ann Veronica,\r\nwhile she affected to read the appeal on a hospital collecting-box upon\r\nthe bureau counter, had a disagreeable sense of being surveyed from\r\nbehind by a small, whiskered gentleman in a frock-coat, who came out of\r\nthe inner office and into the hall among a number of equally observant\r\ngreen porters to look at her and her bags. But the survey was\r\nsatisfactory, and she found herself presently in Room No. 47,\r\nstraightening her hat and waiting for her luggage to appear.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right so far,\u201d she said to herself....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 4\r\n\r\n\r\nBut presently, as she sat on the one antimacassared red silk chair\r\nand surveyed her hold-all and bag in that tidy, rather vacant, and\r\ndehumanized apartment, with its empty wardrobe and desert toilet-table\r\nand pictureless walls and stereotyped furnishings, a sudden blankness\r\ncame upon her as though she didn\u2019t matter, and had been thrust away into\r\nthis impersonal corner, she and her gear....\r\n\r\nShe decided to go out into the London afternoon again and get something\r\nto eat in an Aerated Bread shop or some such place, and perhaps find a\r\ncheap room for herself. Of course that was what she had to do; she had\r\nto find a cheap room for herself and work!\r\n\r\nThis Room No. 47 was no more than a sort of railway compartment on the\r\nway to that.\r\n\r\nHow does one get work?\r\n\r\nShe walked along the Strand and across Trafalgar Square, and by the\r\nHaymarket to Piccadilly, and so through dignified squares and palatial\r\nalleys to Oxford Street; and her mind was divided between a speculative\r\ntreatment of employment on the one hand, and breezes--zephyr breezes--of\r\nthe keenest appreciation for London, on the other. The jolly part of it\r\nwas that for the first time in her life so far as London was concerned,\r\nshe was not going anywhere in particular; for the first time in her life\r\nit seemed to her she was taking London in.\r\n\r\nShe tried to think how people get work. Ought she to walk into some\r\nof these places and tell them what she could do? She hesitated at the\r\nwindow of a shipping-office in Cockspur Street and at the Army and\r\nNavy Stores, but decided that perhaps there would be some special and\r\ncustomary hour, and that it would be better for her to find this out\r\nbefore she made her attempt. And, besides, she didn\u2019t just immediately\r\nwant to make her attempt.\r\n\r\nShe fell into a pleasant dream of positions and work. Behind every one\r\nof these myriad fronts she passed there must be a career or careers. Her\r\nideas of women\u2019s employment and a modern woman\u2019s pose in life were based\r\nlargely on the figure of Vivie Warren in Mrs. Warren\u2019s Profession. She\r\nhad seen Mrs. Warren\u2019s Profession furtively with Hetty Widgett from the\r\ngallery of a Stage Society performance one Monday afternoon. Most of\r\nit had been incomprehensible to her, or comprehensible in a way that\r\nchecked further curiosity, but the figure of Vivien, hard, capable,\r\nsuccessful, and bullying, and ordering about a veritable Teddy in the\r\nperson of Frank Gardner, appealed to her. She saw herself in very much\r\nVivie\u2019s position--managing something.\r\n\r\nHer thoughts were deflected from Vivie Warren by the peculiar behavior\r\nof a middle-aged gentleman in Piccadilly. He appeared suddenly from\r\nthe infinite in the neighborhood of the Burlington Arcade, crossing\r\nthe pavement toward her and with his eyes upon her. He seemed to her\r\nindistinguishably about her father\u2019s age. He wore a silk hat a little\r\ntilted, and a morning coat buttoned round a tight, contained figure;\r\nand a white slip gave a finish to his costume and endorsed the quiet\r\ndistinction of his tie. His face was a little flushed perhaps, and his\r\nsmall, brown eyes were bright. He stopped on the curb-stone, not facing\r\nher but as if he was on his way to cross the road, and spoke to her\r\nsuddenly over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhither away?\u201d he said, very distinctly in a curiously wheedling voice.\r\nAnn Veronica stared at his foolish, propitiatory smile, his hungry gaze,\r\nthrough one moment of amazement, then stepped aside and went on her way\r\nwith a quickened step. But her mind was ruffled, and its mirror-like\r\nsurface of satisfaction was not easily restored.\r\n\r\nQueer old gentleman!\r\n\r\nThe art of ignoring is one of the accomplishments of every well-bred\r\ngirl, so carefully instilled that at last she can even ignore her own\r\nthoughts and her own knowledge. Ann Veronica could at the same time ask\r\nherself what this queer old gentleman could have meant by speaking to\r\nher, and know--know in general terms, at least--what that accosting\r\nsignified. About her, as she had gone day by day to and from the\r\nTredgold College, she had seen and not seen many an incidental aspect\r\nof those sides of life about which girls are expected to know nothing,\r\naspects that were extraordinarily relevant to her own position and\r\noutlook on the world, and yet by convention ineffably remote. For all\r\nthat she was of exceptional intellectual enterprise, she had never\r\nyet considered these things with unaverted eyes. She had viewed them\r\naskance, and without exchanging ideas with any one else in the world\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nShe went on her way now no longer dreaming and appreciative, but\r\ndisturbed and unwillingly observant behind her mask of serene\r\ncontentment.\r\n\r\nThat delightful sense of free, unembarrassed movement was gone.\r\n\r\nAs she neared the bottom of the dip in Piccadilly she saw a woman\r\napproaching her from the opposite direction--a tall woman who at the\r\nfirst glance seemed altogether beautiful and fine. She came along with\r\nthe fluttering assurance of some tall ship. Then as she drew nearer\r\npaint showed upon her face, and a harsh purpose behind the quiet\r\nexpression of her open countenance, and a sort of unreality in her\r\nsplendor betrayed itself for which Ann Veronica could not recall the\r\nright word--a word, half understood, that lurked and hid in her mind,\r\nthe word \u201cmeretricious.\u201d Behind this woman and a little to the side\r\nof her, walked a man smartly dressed, with desire and appraisal in his\r\neyes. Something insisted that those two were mysteriously linked--that\r\nthe woman knew the man was there.\r\n\r\nIt was a second reminder that against her claim to go free and\r\nuntrammelled there was a case to be made, that after all it was true\r\nthat a girl does not go alone in the world unchallenged, nor ever has\r\ngone freely alone in the world, that evil walks abroad and dangers, and\r\npetty insults more irritating than dangers, lurk.\r\n\r\nIt was in the quiet streets and squares toward Oxford Street that\r\nit first came into her head disagreeably that she herself was being\r\nfollowed. She observed a man walking on the opposite side of the way and\r\nlooking toward her.\r\n\r\n\u201cBother it all!\u201d she swore. \u201cBother!\u201d and decided that this was not so,\r\nand would not look to right or left again.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Circus Ann Veronica went into a British Tea-Table Company\r\nshop to get some tea. And as she was yet waiting for her tea to come she\r\nsaw this man again. Either it was an unfortunate recovery of a trail, or\r\nhe had followed her from Mayfair. There was no mistaking his intentions\r\nthis time. He came down the shop looking for her quite obviously, and\r\ntook up a position on the other side against a mirror in which he was\r\nable to regard her steadfastly.\r\n\r\nBeneath the serene unconcern of Ann Veronica\u2019s face was a boiling\r\ntumult. She was furiously angry. She gazed with a quiet detachment\r\ntoward the window and the Oxford Street traffic, and in her heart she\r\nwas busy kicking this man to death. He HAD followed her! What had he\r\nfollowed her for? He must have followed her all the way from beyond\r\nGrosvenor Square.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall man and fair, with bluish eyes that were rather\r\nprotuberant, and long white hands of which he made a display. He had\r\nremoved his silk hat, and now sat looking at Ann Veronica over an\r\nuntouched cup of tea; he sat gloating upon her, trying to catch her eye.\r\nOnce, when he thought he had done so, he smiled an ingratiating smile.\r\nHe moved, after quiet intervals, with a quick little movement, and ever\r\nand again stroked his small mustache and coughed a self-conscious cough.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat he should be in the same world with me!\u201d said Ann Veronica,\r\nreduced to reading the list of good things the British Tea-Table Company\r\nhad priced for its patrons.\r\n\r\nHeaven knows what dim and tawdry conceptions of passion and desire were\r\nin that blond cranium, what romance-begotten dreams of intrigue and\r\nadventure! but they sufficed, when presently Ann Veronica went out\r\ninto the darkling street again, to inspire a flitting, dogged pursuit,\r\nidiotic, exasperating, indecent.\r\n\r\nShe had no idea what she should do. If she spoke to a policeman she did\r\nnot know what would ensue. Perhaps she would have to charge this man and\r\nappear in a police-court next day.\r\n\r\nShe became angry with herself. She would not be driven in by this\r\npersistent, sneaking aggression. She would ignore him. Surely she could\r\nignore him. She stopped abruptly, and looked in a flower-shop window. He\r\npassed, and came loitering back and stood beside her, silently looking\r\ninto her face.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon had passed now into twilight. The shops were lighting\r\nup into gigantic lanterns of color, the street lamps were glowing\r\ninto existence, and she had lost her way. She had lost her sense of\r\ndirection, and was among unfamiliar streets. She went on from street to\r\nstreet, and all the glory of London had departed. Against the sinister,\r\nthe threatening, monstrous inhumanity of the limitless city, there was\r\nnothing now but this supreme, ugly fact of a pursuit--the pursuit of the\r\nundesired, persistent male.\r\n\r\nFor a second time Ann Veronica wanted to swear at the universe.\r\n\r\nThere were moments when she thought of turning upon this man and\r\ntalking to him. But there was something in his face at once stupid and\r\ninvincible that told her he would go on forcing himself upon her, that\r\nhe would esteem speech with her a great point gained. In the twilight\r\nhe had ceased to be a person one could tackle and shame; he had become\r\nsomething more general, a something that crawled and sneaked toward her\r\nand would not let her alone....\r\n\r\nThen, when the tension was getting unendurable, and she was on the verge\r\nof speaking to some casual passer-by and demanding help, her follower\r\nvanished. For a time she could scarcely believe he was gone. He had. The\r\nnight had swallowed him up, but his work on her was done. She had lost\r\nher nerve, and there was no more freedom in London for her that night.\r\nShe was glad to join in the stream of hurrying homeward workers that was\r\nnow welling out of a thousand places of employment, and to imitate their\r\ndriven, preoccupied haste. She had followed a bobbing white hat and gray\r\njacket until she reached the Euston Road corner of Tottenham Court Road,\r\nand there, by the name on a bus and the cries of a conductor, she made\r\na guess of her way. And she did not merely affect to be driven--she felt\r\ndriven. She was afraid people would follow her, she was afraid of the\r\ndark, open doorways she passed, and afraid of the blazes of light; she\r\nwas afraid to be alone, and she knew not what it was she feared.\r\n\r\nIt was past seven when she got back to her hotel. She thought then that\r\nshe had shaken off the man of the bulging blue eyes forever, but that\r\nnight she found he followed her into her dreams. He stalked her, he\r\nstared at her, he craved her, he sidled slinking and propitiatory\r\nand yet relentlessly toward her, until at last she awoke from the\r\nsuffocating nightmare nearness of his approach, and lay awake in fear\r\nand horror listening to the unaccustomed sounds of the hotel.\r\n\r\nShe came very near that night to resolving that she would return to\r\nher home next morning. But the morning brought courage again, and those\r\nfirst intimations of horror vanished completely from her mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 5\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had sent her father a telegram from the East Strand post-office\r\nworded thus:\r\n\r\n     |   All   |    is     |   well   |   with   |   me    |\r\n     |---------|-----------|----------|----------|---------|\r\n     |   and   |   quite   |   safe   | Veronica |         |\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nand afterward she had dined a la carte upon a cutlet, and had then set\r\nherself to write an answer to Mr. Manning\u2019s proposal of marriage. But\r\nshe had found it very difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cDEAR MR. MANNING,\u201d she had begun. So far it had been plain sailing,\r\nand it had seemed fairly evident to go on: \u201cI find it very difficult to\r\nanswer your letter.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut after that neither ideas nor phrases had come and she had fallen\r\nthinking of the events of the day. She had decided that she would spend\r\nthe next morning answering advertisements in the papers that abounded in\r\nthe writing-room; and so, after half an hour\u2019s perusal of back numbers\r\nof the Sketch in the drawing-room, she had gone to bed.\r\n\r\nShe found next morning, when she came to this advertisement answering,\r\nthat it was more difficult than she had supposed. In the first place\r\nthere were not so many suitable advertisements as she had expected.\r\nShe sat down by the paper-rack with a general feeling of resemblance\r\nto Vivie Warren, and looked through the Morning Post and Standard and\r\nTelegraph, and afterward the half-penny sheets. The Morning Post was\r\nhungry for governesses and nursery governesses, but held out no other\r\nhopes; the Daily Telegraph that morning seemed eager only for skirt\r\nhands. She went to a writing-desk and made some memoranda on a sheet of\r\nnote-paper, and then remembered that she had no address as yet to which\r\nletters could be sent.\r\n\r\nShe decided to leave this matter until the morrow and devote the morning\r\nto settling up with Mr. Manning. At the cost of quite a number of torn\r\ndrafts she succeeded in evolving this:\r\n\r\n\u201cDEAR MR. MANNING,--I find it very difficult to answer your letter.\r\nI hope you won\u2019t mind if I say first that I think it does me an\r\nextraordinary honor that you should think of any one like myself\r\nso highly and seriously, and, secondly, that I wish it had not been\r\nwritten.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe surveyed this sentence for some time before going on. \u201cI wonder,\u201d\r\n she said, \u201cwhy one writes him sentences like that? It\u2019ll have to go,\u201d\r\n she decided, \u201cI\u2019ve written too many already.\u201d She went on, with a\r\ndesperate attempt to be easy and colloquial:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, we were rather good friends, I thought, and now perhaps it\r\nwill be difficult for us to get back to the old friendly footing. But if\r\nthat can possibly be done I want it to be done. You see, the plain fact\r\nof the case is that I think I am too young and ignorant for marriage.\r\nI have been thinking these things over lately, and it seems to me that\r\nmarriage for a girl is just the supremest thing in life. It isn\u2019t just\r\none among a number of important things; for her it is the important\r\nthing, and until she knows far more than I know of the facts of life,\r\nhow is she to undertake it? So please; if you will, forget that you\r\nwrote that letter, and forgive this answer. I want you to think of me\r\njust as if I was a man, and quite outside marriage altogether.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do hope you will be able to do this, because I value men friends.\r\nI shall be very sorry if I cannot have you for a friend. I think that\r\nthere is no better friend for a girl than a man rather older than\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps by this time you will have heard of the step I have taken in\r\nleaving my home. Very likely you will disapprove highly of what I have\r\ndone--I wonder? You may, perhaps, think I have done it just in a fit of\r\nchildish petulance because my father locked me in when I wanted to go\r\nto a ball of which he did not approve. But really it is much more\r\nthan that. At Morningside Park I feel as though all my growing up was\r\npresently to stop, as though I was being shut in from the light of life,\r\nand, as they say in botany, etiolated. I was just like a sort of dummy\r\nthat does things as it is told--that is to say, as the strings are\r\npulled. I want to be a person by myself, and to pull my own strings. I\r\nhad rather have trouble and hardship like that than be taken care of by\r\nothers. I want to be myself. I wonder if a man can quite understand that\r\npassionate feeling? It is quite a passionate feeling. So I am already\r\nno longer the girl you knew at Morningside Park. I am a young person\r\nseeking employment and freedom and self-development, just as in quite\r\nour first talk of all I said I wanted to be.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do hope you will see how things are, and not be offended with me or\r\nfrightfully shocked and distressed by what I have done.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n\u201cANN VERONICA STANLEY.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 6\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon she resumed her search for apartments. The intoxicating\r\nsense of novelty had given place to a more business-like mood. She\r\ndrifted northward from the Strand, and came on some queer and dingy\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nShe had never imagined life was half so sinister as it looked to her in\r\nthe beginning of these investigations. She found herself again in the\r\npresence of some element in life about which she had been trained not\r\nto think, about which she was perhaps instinctively indisposed to think;\r\nsomething which jarred, in spite of all her mental resistance, with\r\nall her preconceptions of a clean and courageous girl walking out from\r\nMorningside Park as one walks out of a cell into a free and spacious\r\nworld. One or two landladies refused her with an air of conscious virtue\r\nthat she found hard to explain. \u201cWe don\u2019t let to ladies,\u201d they said.\r\n\r\nShe drifted, via Theobald\u2019s Road, obliquely toward the region about\r\nTitchfield Street. Such apartments as she saw were either scandalously\r\ndirty or unaccountably dear, or both. And some were adorned with\r\nengravings that struck her as being more vulgar and undesirable than\r\nanything she had ever seen in her life. Ann Veronica loved beautiful\r\nthings, and the beauty of undraped loveliness not least among them; but\r\nthese were pictures that did but insist coarsely upon the roundness of\r\nwomen\u2019s bodies. The windows of these rooms were obscured with draperies,\r\ntheir floors a carpet patchwork; the china ornaments on their mantels\r\nwere of a class apart. After the first onset several of the women who\r\nhad apartments to let said she would not do for them, and in effect\r\ndismissed her. This also struck her as odd.\r\n\r\nAbout many of these houses hung a mysterious taint as of something\r\nweakly and commonly and dustily evil; the women who negotiated the rooms\r\nlooked out through a friendly manner as though it was a mask, with hard,\r\ndefiant eyes. Then one old crone, short-sighted and shaky-handed, called\r\nAnn Veronica \u201cdearie,\u201d and made some remark, obscure and slangy, of\r\nwhich the spirit rather than the words penetrated to her understanding.\r\n\r\nFor a time she looked at no more apartments, and walked through\r\ngaunt and ill-cleaned streets, through the sordid under side of life,\r\nperplexed and troubled, ashamed of her previous obtuseness.\r\n\r\nShe had something of the feeling a Hindoo must experience who has been\r\ninto surroundings or touched something that offends his caste. She\r\npassed people in the streets and regarded them with a quickening\r\napprehension, once or twice came girls dressed in slatternly finery,\r\ngoing toward Regent Street from out these places. It did not occur to\r\nher that they at least had found a way of earning a living, and had that\r\nmuch economic superiority to herself. It did not occur to her that save\r\nfor some accidents of education and character they had souls like her\r\nown.\r\n\r\nFor a time Ann Veronica went on her way gauging the quality of sordid\r\nstreets. At last, a little way to the northward of Euston Road, the\r\nmoral cloud seemed to lift, the moral atmosphere to change; clean blinds\r\nappeared in the windows, clean doorsteps before the doors, a different\r\nappeal in the neatly placed cards bearing the word\r\n\r\n     --------------------------\r\n     |        APARTMENTS        |\r\n     --------------------------\r\n\r\nin the clear bright windows. At last in a street near the Hampstead Road\r\nshe hit upon a room that had an exceptional quality of space and order,\r\nand a tall woman with a kindly face to show it. \u201cYou\u2019re a student,\r\nperhaps?\u201d said the tall woman. \u201cAt the Tredgold Women\u2019s College,\u201d said\r\nAnn Veronica. She felt it would save explanations if she did not state\r\nshe had left her home and was looking for employment. The room was\r\npapered with green, large-patterned paper that was at worst a trifle\r\ndingy, and the arm-chair and the seats of the other chairs were covered\r\nwith the unusual brightness of a large-patterned chintz, which also\r\nsupplied the window-curtain. There was a round table covered, not with\r\nthe usual \u201ctapestry\u201d cover, but with a plain green cloth that went\r\npassably with the wall-paper. In the recess beside the fireplace\r\nwere some open bookshelves. The carpet was a quiet drugget and not\r\nexcessively worn, and the bed in the corner was covered by a white\r\nquilt. There were neither texts nor rubbish on the walls, but only a\r\nstirring version of Belshazzar\u2019s feast, a steel engraving in the early\r\nVictorian manner that had some satisfactory blacks. And the woman who\r\nshowed this room was tall, with an understanding eye and the quiet\r\nmanner of the well-trained servant.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica brought her luggage in a cab from the hotel; she tipped the\r\nhotel porter sixpence and overpaid the cabman eighteenpence, unpacked\r\nsome of her books and possessions, and so made the room a little\r\nhomelike, and then sat down in a by no means uncomfortable arm-chair\r\nbefore the fire. She had arranged for a supper of tea, a boiled egg, and\r\nsome tinned peaches. She had discussed the general question of supplies\r\nwith the helpful landlady. \u201cAnd now,\u201d said Ann Veronica surveying her\r\napartment with an unprecedented sense of proprietorship, \u201cwhat is the\r\nnext step?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe spent the evening in writing--it was a little difficult--to her\r\nfather and--which was easier--to the Widgetts. She was greatly heartened\r\nby doing this. The necessity of defending herself and assuming a\r\nconfident and secure tone did much to dispell the sense of being\r\nexposed and indefensible in a huge dingy world that abounded in sinister\r\npossibilities. She addressed her letters, meditated on them for a time,\r\nand then took them out and posted them. Afterward she wanted to get her\r\nletter to her father back in order to read it over again, and, if it\r\ntallied with her general impression of it, re-write it.\r\n\r\nHe would know her address to-morrow. She reflected upon that with a\r\nthrill of terror that was also, somehow, in some faint remote way,\r\ngleeful.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear old Daddy,\u201d she said, \u201che\u2019ll make a fearful fuss. Well, it had to\r\nhappen somewhen.... Somehow. I wonder what he\u2019ll say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SIXTH\r\n\r\nEXPOSTULATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 1\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning opened calmly, and Ann Veronica sat in her own room,\r\nher very own room, and consumed an egg and marmalade, and read the\r\nadvertisements in the Daily Telegraph. Then began expostulations,\r\npreluded by a telegram and headed by her aunt. The telegram reminded\r\nAnn Veronica that she had no place for interviews except her\r\nbed-sitting-room, and she sought her landlady and negotiated hastily for\r\nthe use of the ground floor parlor, which very fortunately was vacant.\r\nShe explained she was expecting an important interview, and asked that\r\nher visitor should be duly shown in. Her aunt arrived about half-past\r\nten, in black and with an unusually thick spotted veil. She raised this\r\nwith the air of a conspirator unmasking, and displayed a tear-flushed\r\nface. For a moment she remained silent.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d she said, when she could get her breath, \u201cyou must come home\r\nat once.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica closed the door quite softly and stood still.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis has almost killed your father.... After Gwen!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI sent a telegram.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe cares so much for you. He did so care for you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI sent a telegram to say I was all right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right! And I never dreamed anything of the sort was going on. I\r\nhad no idea!\u201d She sat down abruptly and threw her wrists limply upon the\r\ntable. \u201cOh, Veronica!\u201d she said, \u201cto leave your home!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe had been weeping. She was weeping now. Ann Veronica was overcome by\r\nthis amount of emotion.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d her aunt urged. \u201cWhy could you not confide in us?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo what?\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat you have done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what have I done?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cElope! Go off in this way. We had no idea. We had such a pride in\r\nyou, such hope in you. I had no idea you were not the happiest girl.\r\nEverything I could do! Your father sat up all night. Until at last I\r\npersuaded him to go to bed. He wanted to put on his overcoat and come\r\nafter you and look for you--in London. We made sure it was just like\r\nGwen. Only Gwen left a letter on the pincushion. You didn\u2019t even do that\r\nVee; not even that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI sent a telegram, aunt,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cLike a stab. You didn\u2019t even put the twelve words.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI said I was all right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGwen said she was happy. Before that came your father didn\u2019t even\r\nknow you were gone. He was just getting cross about your being late for\r\ndinner--you know his way--when it came. He opened it--just off-hand, and\r\nthen when he saw what it was he hit at the table and sent his soup spoon\r\nflying and splashing on to the tablecloth. \u2018My God!\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019ll go\r\nafter them and kill him. I\u2019ll go after them and kill him.\u2019 For the\r\nmoment I thought it was a telegram from Gwen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what did father imagine?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course he imagined! Any one would! \u2018What has happened, Peter?\u2019 I\r\nasked. He was standing up with the telegram crumpled in his hand. He\r\nused a most awful word! Then he said, \u2018It\u2019s Ann Veronica gone to join\r\nher sister!\u2019 \u2018Gone!\u2019 I said. \u2018Gone!\u2019 he said. \u2018Read that,\u2019 and threw the\r\ntelegram at me, so that it went into the tureen. He swore when I tried\r\nto get it out with the ladle, and told me what it said. Then he sat\r\ndown again in a chair and said that people who wrote novels ought to be\r\nstrung up. It was as much as I could do to prevent him flying out of the\r\nhouse there and then and coming after you. Never since I was a girl have\r\nI seen your father so moved. \u2018Oh! little Vee!\u2019 he cried, \u2018little Vee!\u2019\r\nand put his face between his hands and sat still for a long time before\r\nhe broke out again.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica had remained standing while her aunt spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean, aunt,\u201d she asked, \u201cthat my father thought I had gone\r\noff--with some man?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat else COULD he think? Would any one DREAM you would be so mad as to\r\ngo off alone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter--after what had happened the night before?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, why raise up old scores? If you could see him this morning, his\r\npoor face as white as a sheet and all cut about with shaving! He was\r\nfor coming up by the very first train and looking for you, but I said to\r\nhim, \u2018Wait for the letters,\u2019 and there, sure enough, was yours. He could\r\nhardly open the envelope, he trembled so. Then he threw the letter at\r\nme. \u2018Go and fetch her home,\u2019 he said; \u2018it isn\u2019t what we thought! It\u2019s\r\njust a practical joke of hers.\u2019 And with that he went off to the City,\r\nstern and silent, leaving his bacon on his plate--a great slice of bacon\r\nhardly touched. No breakfast, he\u2019s had no dinner, hardly a mouthful of\r\nsoup--since yesterday at tea.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stopped. Aunt and niece regarded each other silently.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must come home to him at once,\u201d said Miss Stanley.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica looked down at her fingers on the claret-colored\r\ntable-cloth. Her aunt had summoned up an altogether too vivid picture\r\nof her father as the masterful man, overbearing, emphatic, sentimental,\r\nnoisy, aimless. Why on earth couldn\u2019t he leave her to grow in her own\r\nway? Her pride rose at the bare thought of return.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I CAN do that,\u201d she said. She looked up and said, a\r\nlittle breathlessly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, aunt, but I don\u2019t think I can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\n\r\nThen it was the expostulations really began.\r\n\r\nFrom first to last, on this occasion, her aunt expostulated for about\r\ntwo hours. \u201cBut, my dear,\u201d she began, \u201cit is Impossible! It is quite out\r\nof the Question. You simply can\u2019t.\u201d And to that, through vast rhetorical\r\nmeanderings, she clung. It reached her only slowly that Ann Veronica was\r\nstanding to her resolution. \u201cHow will you live?\u201d she appealed. \u201cThink\r\nof what people will say!\u201d That became a refrain. \u201cThink of what Lady\r\nPalsworthy will say! Think of what\u201d--So-and-so--\u201cwill say! What are we\r\nto tell people?\r\n\r\n\u201cBesides, what am I to tell your father?\u201d\r\n\r\nAt first it had not been at all clear to Ann Veronica that she would\r\nrefuse to return home; she had had some dream of a capitulation that\r\nshould leave her an enlarged and defined freedom, but as her aunt put\r\nthis aspect and that of her flight to her, as she wandered illogically\r\nand inconsistently from one urgent consideration to another, as she\r\nmingled assurances and aspects and emotions, it became clearer and\r\nclearer to the girl that there could be little or no change in the\r\nposition of things if she returned. \u201cAnd what will Mr. Manning think?\u201d\r\n said her aunt.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what any one thinks,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what has come over you,\u201d said her aunt. \u201cI can\u2019t\r\nconceive what you want. You foolish girl!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica took that in silence. At the back of her mind, dim and yet\r\ndisconcerting, was the perception that she herself did not know what she\r\nwanted. And yet she knew it was not fair to call her a foolish girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you care for Mr. Manning?\u201d said her aunt.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see what he has to do with my coming to London?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe--he worships the ground you tread on. You don\u2019t deserve it, but he\r\ndoes. Or at least he did the day before yesterday. And here you are!\u201d\r\n\r\nHer aunt opened all the fingers of her gloved hand in a rhetorical\r\ngesture. \u201cIt seems to me all madness--madness! Just because your\r\nfather--wouldn\u2019t let you disobey him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the task of expostulation was taken up by Mr. Stanley\r\nin person. Her father\u2019s ideas of expostulation were a little harsh and\r\nforcible, and over the claret-colored table-cloth and under the gas\r\nchandelier, with his hat and umbrella between them like the mace in\r\nParliament, he and his daughter contrived to have a violent quarrel. She\r\nhad intended to be quietly dignified, but he was in a smouldering rage\r\nfrom the beginning, and began by assuming, which alone was more than\r\nflesh and blood could stand, that the insurrection was over and that she\r\nwas coming home submissively. In his desire to be emphatic and to avenge\r\nhimself for his over-night distresses, he speedily became brutal, more\r\nbrutal than she had ever known him before.\r\n\r\n\u201cA nice time of anxiety you\u2019ve given me, young lady,\u201d he said, as he\r\nentered the room. \u201cI hope you\u2019re satisfied.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was frightened--his anger always did frighten her--and in her\r\nresolve to conceal her fright she carried a queen-like dignity to what\r\nshe felt even at the time was a preposterous pitch. She said she hoped\r\nshe had not distressed him by the course she had felt obliged to take,\r\nand he told her not to be a fool. She tried to keep her side up by\r\ndeclaring that he had put her into an impossible position, and he\r\nreplied by shouting, \u201cNonsense! Nonsense! Any father in my place would\r\nhave done what I did.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen he went on to say: \u201cWell, you\u2019ve had your little adventure, and I\r\nhope now you\u2019ve had enough of it. So go up-stairs and get your things\r\ntogether while I look out for a hansom.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo which the only possible reply seemed to be, \u201cI\u2019m not coming home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot coming home!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d And, in spite of her resolve to be a Person, Ann Veronica began\r\nto weep with terror at herself. Apparently she was always doomed to weep\r\nwhen she talked to her father. But he was always forcing her to say and\r\ndo such unexpectedly conclusive things. She feared he might take her\r\ntears as a sign of weakness. So she said: \u201cI won\u2019t come home. I\u2019d rather\r\nstarve!\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment the conversation hung upon that declaration. Then Mr.\r\nStanley, putting his hands on the table in the manner rather of a\r\nbarrister than a solicitor, and regarding her balefully through his\r\nglasses with quite undisguised animosity, asked, \u201cAnd may I presume to\r\ninquire, then, what you mean to do?--how do you propose to live?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall live,\u201d sobbed Ann Veronica. \u201cYou needn\u2019t be anxious about that!\r\nI shall contrive to live.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I AM anxious,\u201d said Mr. Stanley, \u201cI am anxious. Do you think it\u2019s\r\nnothing to me to have my daughter running about London looking for odd\r\njobs and disgracing herself?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSha\u2019n\u2019t get odd jobs,\u201d said Ann Veronica, wiping her eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd from that point they went on to a thoroughly embittering wrangle.\r\nMr. Stanley used his authority, and commanded Ann Veronica to come home,\r\nto which, of course, she said she wouldn\u2019t; and then he warned her not\r\nto defy him, warned her very solemnly, and then commanded her again.\r\nHe then said that if she would not obey him in this course she should\r\n\u201cnever darken his doors again,\u201d and was, indeed, frightfully abusive.\r\nThis threat terrified Ann Veronica so much that she declared with sobs\r\nand vehemence that she would never come home again, and for a time both\r\ntalked at once and very wildly. He asked her whether she understood what\r\nshe was saying, and went on to say still more precisely that she should\r\nnever touch a penny of his money until she came home again--not one\r\npenny. Ann Veronica said she didn\u2019t care.\r\n\r\nThen abruptly Mr. Stanley changed his key. \u201cYou poor child!\u201d he said;\r\n\u201cdon\u2019t you see the infinite folly of these proceedings? Think! Think of\r\nthe love and affection you abandon! Think of your aunt, a second mother\r\nto you. Think if your own mother was alive!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe paused, deeply moved.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf my own mother was alive,\u201d sobbed Ann Veronica, \u201cshe would\r\nunderstand.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe talk became more and more inconclusive and exhausting. Ann Veronica\r\nfound herself incompetent, undignified, and detestable, holding on\r\ndesperately to a hardening antagonism to her father, quarrelling with\r\nhim, wrangling with him, thinking of repartees--almost as if he was a\r\nbrother. It was horrible, but what could she do? She meant to live\r\nher own life, and he meant, with contempt and insults, to prevent her.\r\nAnything else that was said she now regarded only as an aspect of or\r\ndiversion from that.\r\n\r\nIn the retrospect she was amazed to think how things had gone to pieces,\r\nfor at the outset she had been quite prepared to go home again upon\r\nterms. While waiting for his coming she had stated her present\r\nand future relations with him with what had seemed to her the most\r\nsatisfactory lucidity and completeness. She had looked forward to an\r\nexplanation. Instead had come this storm, this shouting, this weeping,\r\nthis confusion of threats and irrelevant appeals. It was not only that\r\nher father had said all sorts of inconsistent and unreasonable things,\r\nbut that by some incomprehensible infection she herself had replied in\r\nthe same vein. He had assumed that her leaving home was the point at\r\nissue, that everything turned on that, and that the sole alternative was\r\nobedience, and she had fallen in with that assumption until rebellion\r\nseemed a sacred principle. Moreover, atrociously and inexorably, he\r\nallowed it to appear ever and again in horrible gleams that he suspected\r\nthere was some man in the case.... Some man!\r\n\r\nAnd to conclude it all was the figure of her father in the doorway,\r\ngiving her a last chance, his hat in one hand, his umbrella in the\r\nother, shaken at her to emphasize his point.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou understand, then,\u201d he was saying, \u201cyou understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand,\u201d said Ann Veronica, tear-wet and flushed with a\r\nreciprocal passion, but standing up to him with an equality that amazed\r\neven herself, \u201cI understand.\u201d She controlled a sob. \u201cNot a penny--not\r\none penny--and never darken your doors again!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 4\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day her aunt came again and expostulated, and was just saying\r\nit was \u201can unheard-of thing\u201d for a girl to leave her home as Ann\r\nVeronica had done, when her father arrived, and was shown in by the\r\npleasant-faced landlady.\r\n\r\nHer father had determined on a new line. He put down his hat and\r\numbrella, rested his hands on his hips, and regarded Ann Veronica\r\nfirmly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d he said, quietly, \u201cit\u2019s time we stopped this nonsense.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica was about to reply, when he went on, with a still more\r\ndeadly quiet: \u201cI am not here to bandy words with you. Let us have no\r\nmore of this humbug. You are to come home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought I explained--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can have heard me,\u201d said her father; \u201cI have told you\r\nto come home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought I explained--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome home!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said her father.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think this ends the business,\u201d he said, turning to his sister.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for us to supplicate any more. She must learn wisdom--as God\r\npleases.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, my dear Peter!\u201d said Miss Stanley.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said her brother, conclusively, \u201cit\u2019s not for a parent to go on\r\npersuading a child.\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Stanley rose and regarded Ann Veronica fixedly. The girl stood with\r\nher hands behind her back, sulky, resolute, and intelligent, a strand\r\nof her black hair over one eye and looking more than usually\r\ndelicate-featured, and more than ever like an obdurate child.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe does.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what makes you fly out against everything like this,\u201d\r\n said Miss Stanley to her niece.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the good of talking?\u201d said her brother. \u201cShe must go her own\r\nway. A man\u2019s children nowadays are not his own. That\u2019s the fact of the\r\nmatter. Their minds are turned against him.... Rubbishy novels and\r\npernicious rascals. We can\u2019t even protect them from themselves.\u201d\r\n\r\nAn immense gulf seemed to open between father and daughter as he said\r\nthese words.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d gasped Ann Veronica, \u201cwhy parents and children...\r\nshouldn\u2019t be friends.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFriends!\u201d said her father. \u201cWhen we see you going through disobedience\r\nto the devil! Come, Molly, she must go her own way. I\u2019ve tried to use my\r\nauthority. And she defies me. What more is there to be said? She defies\r\nme!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was extraordinary. Ann Veronica felt suddenly an effect of tremendous\r\npathos; she would have given anything to have been able to frame and\r\nmake some appeal, some utterance that should bridge this bottomless\r\nchasm that had opened between her and her father, and she could find\r\nnothing whatever to say that was in the least sincere and appealing.\r\n\r\n\u201cFather,\u201d she cried, \u201cI have to live!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe misunderstood her. \u201cThat,\u201d he said, grimly, with his hand on the\r\ndoor-handle, \u201cmust be your own affair, unless you choose to live at\r\nMorningside Park.\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Stanley turned to her. \u201cVee,\u201d she said, \u201ccome home. Before it is\r\ntoo late.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, Molly,\u201d said Mr. Stanley, at the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cVee!\u201d said Miss Stanley, \u201cyou hear what your father says!\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Stanley struggled with emotion. She made a curious movement toward\r\nher niece, then suddenly, convulsively, she dabbed down something lumpy\r\non the table and turned to follow her brother. Ann Veronica stared for a\r\nmoment in amazement at this dark-green object that clashed as it was\r\nput down. It was a purse. She made a step forward. \u201cAunt!\u201d she said, \u201cI\r\ncan\u2019t--\u201d\r\n\r\nThen she caught a wild appeal in her aunt\u2019s blue eye, halted, and the\r\ndoor clicked upon them.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and then the front door slammed....\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica realized that she was alone with the world. And this time\r\nthe departure had a tremendous effect of finality. She had to resist an\r\nimpulse of sheer terror, to run out after them and give in.\r\n\r\n\u201cGods,\u201d she said, at last, \u201cI\u2019ve done it this time!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d She took up the neat morocco purse, opened it, and examined the\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\nIt contained three sovereigns, six and fourpence, two postage stamps, a\r\nsmall key, and her aunt\u2019s return half ticket to Morningside Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 5\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the interview Ann Veronica considered herself formally cut off\r\nfrom home. If nothing else had clinched that, the purse had.\r\n\r\nNevertheless there came a residuum of expostulations. Her brother Roddy,\r\nwho was in the motor line, came to expostulate; her sister Alice wrote.\r\nAnd Mr. Manning called.\r\n\r\nHer sister Alice seemed to have developed a religious sense away there\r\nin Yorkshire, and made appeals that had no meaning for Ann Veronica\u2019s\r\nmind. She exhorted Ann Veronica not to become one of \u201cthose unsexed\r\nintellectuals, neither man nor woman.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica meditated over that phrase. \u201cThat\u2019s HIM,\u201d said Ann\r\nVeronica, in sound, idiomatic English. \u201cPoor old Alice!\u201d\r\n\r\nHer brother Roddy came to her and demanded tea, and asked her to state\r\na case. \u201cBit thick on the old man, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Roddy, who had\r\ndeveloped a bluff, straightforward style in the motor shop.\r\n\r\n\u201cMind my smoking?\u201d said Roddy. \u201cI don\u2019t see quite what your game is,\r\nVee, but I suppose you\u2019ve got a game on somewhere.\r\n\r\n\u201cRummy lot we are!\u201d said Roddy. \u201cAlice--Alice gone dotty, and all over\r\nkids. Gwen--I saw Gwen the other day, and the paint\u2019s thicker than ever.\r\nJim is up to the neck in Mahatmas and Theosophy and Higher Thought and\r\nrot--writes letters worse than Alice. And now YOU\u2019RE on the war-path. I\r\nbelieve I\u2019m the only sane member of the family left. The G.V.\u2019s as mad\r\nas any of you, in spite of all his respectability; not a bit of him\r\nstraight anywhere, not one bit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStraight?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it! He\u2019s been out after eight per cent. since the\r\nbeginning. Eight per cent.! He\u2019ll come a cropper one of these days,\r\nif you ask me. He\u2019s been near it once or twice already. That\u2019s got his\r\nnerves to rags. I suppose we\u2019re all human beings really, but what price\r\nthe sacred Institution of the Family! Us as a bundle! Eh?... I don\u2019t\r\nhalf disagree with you, Vee, really; only thing is, I don\u2019t see\r\nhow you\u2019re going to pull it off. A home MAY be a sort of cage, but\r\nstill--it\u2019s a home. Gives you a right to hang on to the old man until he\r\nbusts--practically. Jolly hard life for a girl, getting a living. Not MY\r\naffair.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe asked questions and listened to her views for a time.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d chuck this lark right off if I were you, Vee,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m five\r\nyears older than you, and no end wiser, being a man. What you\u2019re after\r\nis too risky. It\u2019s a damned hard thing to do. It\u2019s all very handsome\r\nstarting out on your own, but it\u2019s too damned hard. That\u2019s my opinion,\r\nif you ask me. There\u2019s nothing a girl can do that isn\u2019t sweated to the\r\nbone. You square the G.V., and go home before you have to. That\u2019s my\r\nadvice. If you don\u2019t eat humble-pie now you may live to fare worse\r\nlater. _I_ can\u2019t help you a cent. Life\u2019s hard enough nowadays for an\r\nunprotected male. Let alone a girl. You got to take the world as it is,\r\nand the only possible trade for a girl that isn\u2019t sweated is to get hold\r\nof a man and make him do it for her. It\u2019s no good flying out at that,\r\nVee; _I_ didn\u2019t arrange it. It\u2019s Providence. That\u2019s how things are;\r\nthat\u2019s the order of the world. Like appendicitis. It isn\u2019t pretty, but\r\nwe\u2019re made so. Rot, no doubt; but we can\u2019t alter it. You go home and\r\nlive on the G.V., and get some other man to live on as soon as possible.\r\nIt isn\u2019t sentiment but it\u2019s horse sense. All this Woman-who-Diddery--no\r\ndamn good. After all, old P.--Providence, I mean--HAS arranged it so\r\nthat men will keep you, more or less. He made the universe on those\r\nlines. You\u2019ve got to take what you can get.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat was the quintessence of her brother Roddy.\r\n\r\nHe played variations on this theme for the better part of an hour.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou go home,\u201d he said, at parting; \u201cyou go home. It\u2019s all very fine and\r\nall that, Vee, this freedom, but it isn\u2019t going to work. The world isn\u2019t\r\nready for girls to start out on their own yet; that\u2019s the plain fact of\r\nthe case. Babies and females have got to keep hold of somebody or go\r\nunder--anyhow, for the next few generations. You go home and wait a\r\ncentury, Vee, and then try again. Then you may have a bit of a chance.\r\nNow you haven\u2019t the ghost of one--not if you play the game fair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 6\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was remarkable to Ann Veronica how completely Mr. Manning, in his\r\nentirely different dialect, indorsed her brother Roddy\u2019s view of things.\r\nHe came along, he said, just to call, with large, loud apologies,\r\nradiantly kind and good. Miss Stanley, it was manifest, had given him\r\nAnn Veronica\u2019s address. The kindly faced landlady had failed to catch\r\nhis name, and said he was a tall, handsome gentleman with a great black\r\nmustache. Ann Veronica, with a sigh at the cost of hospitality, made a\r\nhasty negotiation for an extra tea and for a fire in the ground-floor\r\napartment, and preened herself carefully for the interview. In the\r\nlittle apartment, under the gas chandelier, his inches and his stoop\r\nwere certainly very effective. In the bad light he looked at once\r\nmilitary and sentimental and studious, like one of Ouida\u2019s guardsmen\r\nrevised by Mr. Haldane and the London School of Economics and finished\r\nin the Keltic school.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s unforgivable of me to call, Miss Stanley,\u201d he said, shaking hands\r\nin a peculiar, high, fashionable manner; \u201cbut you know you said we might\r\nbe friends.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s dreadful for you to be here,\u201d he said, indicating the yellow\r\npresence of the first fog of the year without, \u201cbut your aunt told me\r\nsomething of what had happened. It\u2019s just like your Splendid Pride to do\r\nit. Quite!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe sat in the arm-chair and took tea, and consumed several of the\r\nextra cakes which she had sent out for and talked to her and expressed\r\nhimself, looking very earnestly at her with his deep-set eyes, and\r\ncarefully avoiding any crumbs on his mustache the while. Ann Veronica\r\nsat firelit by her tea-tray with, quite unconsciously, the air of an\r\nexpert hostess.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how is it all going to end?\u201d said Mr. Manning.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour father, of course,\u201d he said, \u201cmust come to realize just how\r\nSplendid you are! He doesn\u2019t understand. I\u2019ve seen him, and he doesn\u2019t\r\na bit understand. _I_ didn\u2019t understand before that letter. It makes me\r\nwant to be just everything I CAN be to you. You\u2019re like some splendid\r\nPrincess in Exile in these Dreadful Dingy apartments!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m anything but a Princess when it comes to earning a\r\nsalary,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cBut frankly, I mean to fight this through\r\nif I possibly can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God!\u201d said Manning, in a stage-aside. \u201cEarning a salary!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re like a Princess in Exile!\u201d he repeated, overruling her. \u201cYou\r\ncome into these sordid surroundings--you mustn\u2019t mind my calling them\r\nsordid--and it makes them seem as though they didn\u2019t matter.... I\r\ndon\u2019t think they do matter. I don\u2019t think any surroundings could throw a\r\nshadow on you.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica felt a slight embarrassment. \u201cWon\u2019t you have some more tea,\r\nMr. Manning?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know--,\u201d said Mr. Manning, relinquishing his cup without answering\r\nher question, \u201cwhen I hear you talk of earning a living, it\u2019s as if I\r\nheard of an archangel going on the Stock Exchange--or Christ selling\r\ndoves.... Forgive my daring. I couldn\u2019t help the thought.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very good image,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut does it correspond with the facts of the case? You know, Mr.\r\nManning, all this sort of thing is very well as sentiment, but does it\r\ncorrespond with the realities? Are women truly such angelic things and\r\nmen so chivalrous? You men have, I know, meant to make us Queens and\r\nGoddesses, but in practice--well, look, for example, at the stream of\r\ngirls one meets going to work of a morning, round-shouldered, cheap, and\r\nunderfed! They aren\u2019t queens, and no one is treating them as queens.\r\nAnd look, again, at the women one finds letting lodgings.... I was\r\nlooking for rooms last week. It got on my nerves--the women I saw. Worse\r\nthan any man. Everywhere I went and rapped at a door I found behind it\r\nanother dreadful dingy woman--another fallen queen, I suppose--dingier\r\nthan the last, dirty, you know, in grain. Their poor hands!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Mr. Manning, with entirely suitable emotion.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd think of the ordinary wives and mothers, with their anxiety, their\r\nlimitations, their swarms of children!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Manning displayed distress. He fended these things off from him with\r\nthe rump of his fourth piece of cake. \u201cI know that our social order is\r\ndreadful enough,\u201d he said, \u201cand sacrifices all that is best and most\r\nbeautiful in life. I don\u2019t defend it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd besides, when it comes to the idea of queens,\u201d Ann Veronica went\r\non, \u201cthere\u2019s twenty-one and a half million women to twenty million men.\r\nSuppose our proper place is a shrine. Still, that leaves over a million\r\nshrines short, not reckoning widows who re-marry. And more boys die than\r\ngirls, so that the real disproportion among adults is even greater.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Mr Manning, \u201cI know these Dreadful Statistics. I know\r\nthere\u2019s a sort of right in your impatience at the slowness of Progress.\r\nBut tell me one thing I don\u2019t understand--tell me one thing: How can you\r\nhelp it by coming down into the battle and the mire? That\u2019s the thing\r\nthat concerns me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not trying to help it,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cI\u2019m only arguing\r\nagainst your position of what a woman should be, and trying to get\r\nit clear in my own mind. I\u2019m in this apartment and looking for work\r\nbecause--Well, what else can I do, when my father practically locks me\r\nup?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Mr. Manning, \u201cI know. Don\u2019t think I can\u2019t sympathize and\r\nunderstand. Still, here we are in this dingy, foggy city. Ye gods! what\r\na wilderness it is! Every one trying to get the better of every one,\r\nevery one regardless of every one--it\u2019s one of those days when every one\r\nbumps against you--every one pouring coal smoke into the air and making\r\nconfusion worse confounded, motor omnibuses clattering and smelling,\r\na horse down in the Tottenham Court Road, an old woman at the corner\r\ncoughing dreadfully--all the painful sights of a great city, and here\r\nyou come into it to take your chances. It\u2019s too valiant, Miss Stanley,\r\ntoo valiant altogether!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica meditated. She had had two days of employment-seeking now.\r\n\u201cI wonder if it is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d said Mr. Manning, \u201cthat I mind Courage in a Woman--I love\r\nand admire Courage. What could be more splendid than a beautiful girl\r\nfacing a great, glorious tiger? Una and the Lion again, and all that!\r\nBut this isn\u2019t that sort of thing; this is just a great, ugly, endless\r\nwilderness of selfish, sweating, vulgar competition!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat you want to keep me out of?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly!\u201d said Mr. Manning.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn a sort of beautiful garden-close--wearing lovely dresses and picking\r\nbeautiful flowers?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! If one could!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhile those other girls trudge to business and those other women let\r\nlodgings. And in reality even that magic garden-close resolves itself\r\ninto a villa at Morningside Park and my father being more and more\r\ncross and overbearing at meals--and a general feeling of insecurity and\r\nfutility.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Manning relinquished his cup, and looked meaningly at Ann Veronica.\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d he said, \u201cyou don\u2019t treat me fairly, Miss Stanley. My\r\ngarden-close would be a better thing than that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SEVENTH\r\n\r\nIDEALS AND A REALITY\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 1\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now for some weeks Ann Veronica was to test her market value in the\r\nworld. She went about in a negligent November London that had become\r\nvery dark and foggy and greasy and forbidding indeed, and tried to find\r\nthat modest but independent employment she had so rashly assumed. She\r\nwent about, intent-looking and self-possessed, trim and fine, concealing\r\nher emotions whatever they were, as the realities of her position opened\r\nout before her. Her little bed-sitting-room was like a lair, and she\r\nwent out from it into this vast, dun world, with its smoke-gray houses,\r\nits glaring streets of shops, its dark streets of homes, its orange-lit\r\nwindows, under skies of dull copper or muddy gray or black, much as an\r\nanimal goes out to seek food. She would come back and write letters,\r\ncarefully planned and written letters, or read some book she had fetched\r\nfrom Mudie\u2019s--she had invested a half-guinea with Mudie\u2019s--or sit over\r\nher fire and think.\r\n\r\nSlowly and reluctantly she came to realize that Vivie Warren was what\r\nis called an \u201cideal.\u201d There were no such girls and no such positions. No\r\nwork that offered was at all of the quality she had vaguely postulated\r\nfor herself. With such qualifications as she possessed, two chief\r\nchannels of employment lay open, and neither attracted her, neither\r\nseemed really to offer a conclusive escape from that subjection to\r\nmankind against which, in the person of her father, she was rebelling.\r\nOne main avenue was for her to become a sort of salaried accessory wife\r\nor mother, to be a governess or an assistant schoolmistress, or a very\r\nhigh type of governess-nurse. The other was to go into business--into a\r\nphotographer\u2019s reception-room, for example, or a costumer\u2019s or hat-shop.\r\nThe first set of occupations seemed to her to be altogether too domestic\r\nand restricted; for the latter she was dreadfully handicapped by her\r\nwant of experience. And also she didn\u2019t like them. She didn\u2019t like the\r\nshops, she didn\u2019t like the other women\u2019s faces; she thought the\r\nsmirking men in frock-coats who dominated these establishments the\r\nmost intolerable persons she had ever had to face. One called her very\r\ndistinctly \u201cMy dear!\u201d\r\n\r\nTwo secretarial posts did indeed seem to offer themselves in which, at\r\nleast, there was no specific exclusion of womanhood; one was under\r\na Radical Member of Parliament, and the other under a Harley Street\r\ndoctor, and both men declined her proffered services with the utmost\r\ncivility and admiration and terror. There was also a curious interview\r\nat a big hotel with a middle-aged, white-powdered woman, all covered\r\nwith jewels and reeking of scent, who wanted a Companion. She did not\r\nthink Ann Veronica would do as her companion.\r\n\r\nAnd nearly all these things were fearfully ill-paid. They carried no\r\nmore than bare subsistence wages; and they demanded all her time and\r\nenergy. She had heard of women journalists, women writers, and so\r\nforth; but she was not even admitted to the presence of the editors she\r\ndemanded to see, and by no means sure that if she had been she could\r\nhave done any work they might have given her. One day she desisted from\r\nher search and went unexpectedly to the Tredgold College. Her place\r\nwas not filled; she had been simply noted as absent, and she did a\r\ncomforting day of admirable dissection upon the tortoise. She was so\r\ninterested, and this was such a relief from the trudging anxiety of her\r\nsearch for work, that she went on for a whole week as if she was still\r\nliving at home. Then a third secretarial opening occurred and renewed\r\nher hopes again: a position as amanuensis--with which some of the\r\nlighter duties of a nurse were combined--to an infirm gentleman of means\r\nliving at Twickenham, and engaged upon a great literary research to\r\nprove that the \u201cFaery Queen\u201d was really a treatise upon molecular\r\nchemistry written in a peculiar and picturesquely handled cipher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, while Ann Veronica was taking these soundings in the industrial\r\nsea, and measuring herself against the world as it is, she was also\r\nmaking extensive explorations among the ideas and attitudes of a number\r\nof human beings who seemed to be largely concerned with the world as it\r\nought to be. She was drawn first by Miss Miniver, and then by her own\r\nnatural interest, into a curious stratum of people who are busied with\r\ndreams of world progress, of great and fundamental changes, of a New Age\r\nthat is to replace all the stresses and disorders of contemporary life.\r\n\r\nMiss Miniver learned of her flight and got her address from the\r\nWidgetts. She arrived about nine o\u2019clock the next evening in a state of\r\ntremulous enthusiasm. She followed the landlady half way up-stairs, and\r\ncalled up to Ann Veronica, \u201cMay I come up? It\u2019s me! You know--Nettie\r\nMiniver!\u201d She appeared before Ann Veronica could clearly recall who\r\nNettie Miniver might be.\r\n\r\nThere was a wild light in her eye, and her straight hair was out\r\ndemonstrating and suffragetting upon some independent notions of its\r\nown. Her fingers were bursting through her gloves, as if to get at once\r\ninto touch with Ann Veronica. \u201cYou\u2019re Glorious!\u201d said Miss Miniver in\r\ntones of rapture, holding a hand in each of hers and peering up into Ann\r\nVeronica\u2019s face. \u201cGlorious! You\u2019re so calm, dear, and so resolute, so\r\nserene!\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s girls like you who will show them what We are,\u201d said Miss Miniver;\r\n\u201cgirls whose spirits have not been broken!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica sunned herself a little in this warmth.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was watching you at Morningside Park, dear,\u201d said Miss Miniver. \u201cI am\r\ngetting to watch all women. I thought then perhaps you didn\u2019t care, that\r\nyou were like so many of them. NOW it\u2019s just as though you had grown up\r\nsuddenly.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stopped, and then suggested: \u201cI wonder--I should love--if it was\r\nanything _I_ said.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe did not wait for Ann Veronica\u2019s reply. She seemed to assume that it\r\nmust certainly be something she had said. \u201cThey all catch on,\u201d she said.\r\n\u201cIt spreads like wildfire. This is such a grand time! Such a glorious\r\ntime! There never was such a time as this! Everything seems so close to\r\nfruition, so coming on and leading on! The Insurrection of Women! They\r\nspring up everywhere. Tell me all that happened, one sister-woman to\r\nanother.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe chilled Ann Veronica a little by that last phrase, and yet the\r\nmagnetism of her fellowship and enthusiasm was very strong; and it was\r\npleasant to be made out a heroine after so much expostulation and so\r\nmany secret doubts.\r\n\r\nBut she did not listen long; she wanted to talk. She sat, crouched\r\ntogether, by the corner of the hearthrug under the bookcase that\r\nsupported the pig\u2019s skull, and looked into the fire and up at Ann\r\nVeronica\u2019s face, and let herself go. \u201cLet us put the lamp out,\u201d she\r\nsaid; \u201cthe flames are ever so much better for talking,\u201d and Ann Veronica\r\nagreed. \u201cYou are coming right out into life--facing it all.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica sat with her chin on her hand, red-lit and saying little,\r\nand Miss Miniver discoursed. As she talked, the drift and significance\r\nof what she was saying shaped itself slowly to Ann Veronica\u2019s\r\napprehension. It presented itself in the likeness of a great, gray, dull\r\nworld--a brutal, superstitious, confused, and wrong-headed world,\r\nthat hurt people and limited people unaccountably. In remote times and\r\ncountries its evil tendencies had expressed themselves in the form of\r\ntyrannies, massacres, wars, and what not; but just at present in England\r\nthey shaped as commercialism and competition, silk hats, suburban\r\nmorals, the sweating system, and the subjection of women. So far the\r\nthing was acceptable enough. But over against the world Miss Miniver\r\nassembled a small but energetic minority, the Children of Light--people\r\nshe described as \u201cbeing in the van,\u201d or \u201caltogether in the van,\u201d about\r\nwhom Ann Veronica\u2019s mind was disposed to be more sceptical.\r\n\r\nEverything, Miss Miniver said, was \u201cworking up,\u201d everything was \u201ccoming\r\non\u201d--the Higher Thought, the Simple Life, Socialism, Humanitarianism, it\r\nwas all the same really. She loved to be there, taking part in it all,\r\nbreathing it, being it. Hitherto in the world\u2019s history there had been\r\nprecursors of this Progress at great intervals, voices that had spoken\r\nand ceased, but now it was all coming on together in a rush. She\r\nmentioned, with familiar respect, Christ and Buddha and Shelley and\r\nNietzsche and Plato. Pioneers all of them. Such names shone brightly in\r\nthe darkness, with black spaces of unilluminated emptiness about them,\r\nas stars shine in the night; but now--now it was different; now it was\r\ndawn--the real dawn.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe women are taking it up,\u201d said Miss Miniver; \u201cthe women and the\r\ncommon people, all pressing forward, all roused.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica listened with her eyes on the fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cEverybody is taking it up,\u201d said Miss Miniver. \u201cYOU had to come in. You\r\ncouldn\u2019t help it. Something drew you. Something draws everybody. From\r\nsuburbs, from country towns--everywhere. I see all the Movements. As\r\nfar as I can, I belong to them all. I keep my finger on the pulse of\r\nthings.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica said nothing.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe dawn!\u201d said Miss Miniver, with her glasses reflecting the fire like\r\npools of blood-red flame.\r\n\r\n\u201cI came to London,\u201d said Ann Veronica, \u201crather because of my own\r\ndifficulty. I don\u2019t know that I understand altogether.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course you don\u2019t,\u201d said Miss Miniver, gesticulating triumphantly\r\nwith her thin hand and thinner wrist, and patting Ann Veronica\u2019s knee.\r\n\u201cOf course you don\u2019t. That\u2019s the wonder of it. But you will, you\r\nwill. You must let me take you to things--to meetings and things, to\r\nconferences and talks. Then you will begin to see. You will begin to see\r\nit all opening out. I am up to the ears in it all--every moment I can\r\nspare. I throw up work--everything! I just teach in one school, one good\r\nschool, three days a week. All the rest--Movements! I can live now on\r\nfourpence a day. Think how free that leaves me to follow things up! I\r\nmust take you everywhere. I must take you to the Suffrage people, and\r\nthe Tolstoyans, and the Fabians.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have heard of the Fabians,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s THE Society!\u201d said Miss Miniver. \u201cIt\u2019s the centre of the\r\nintellectuals. Some of the meetings are wonderful! Such earnest,\r\nbeautiful women! Such deep-browed men!... And to think that there\r\nthey are making history! There they are putting together the plans of a\r\nnew world. Almost light-heartedly. There is Shaw, and Webb, and Wilkins\r\nthe author, and Toomer, and Doctor Tumpany--the most wonderful people!\r\nThere you see them discussing, deciding, planning! Just think--THEY ARE\r\nMAKING A NEW WORLD!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut ARE these people going to alter everything?\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat else can happen?\u201d asked Miss Miniver, with a little weak gesture\r\nat the glow. \u201cWhat else can possibly happen--as things are going now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Miniver let Ann Veronica into her peculiar levels of the world\r\nwith so enthusiastic a generosity that it seemed ingratitude to remain\r\ncritical. Indeed, almost insensibly Ann Veronica became habituated to\r\nthe peculiar appearance and the peculiar manners of the people \u201cin the\r\nvan.\u201d The shock of their intellectual attitude was over, usage robbed\r\nit of the first quaint effect of deliberate unreason. They were in many\r\nrespects so right; she clung to that, and shirked more and more the\r\nparadoxical conviction that they were also somehow, and even in direct\r\nrelation to that rightness, absurd.\r\n\r\nVery central in Miss Miniver\u2019s universe were the Goopes. The Goopes were\r\nthe oddest little couple conceivable, following a fruitarian career upon\r\nan upper floor in Theobald\u2019s Road. They were childless and servantless,\r\nand they had reduced simple living to the finest of fine arts. Mr.\r\nGoopes, Ann Veronica gathered, was a mathematical tutor and visited\r\nschools, and his wife wrote a weekly column in New Ideas upon vegetarian\r\ncookery, vivisection, degeneration, the lacteal secretion, appendicitis,\r\nand the Higher Thought generally, and assisted in the management of\r\na fruit shop in the Tottenham Court Road. Their very furniture had\r\nmysteriously a high-browed quality, and Mr. Goopes when at home dressed\r\nsimply in a pajama-shaped suit of canvas sacking tied with brown\r\nribbons, while his wife wore a purple djibbah with a richly\r\nembroidered yoke. He was a small, dark, reserved man, with a large\r\ninflexible-looking convex forehead, and his wife was very pink and\r\nhigh-spirited, with one of those chins that pass insensibly into a full,\r\nstrong neck. Once a week, every Saturday, they had a little gathering\r\nfrom nine till the small hours, just talk and perhaps reading aloud and\r\nfruitarian refreshments--chestnut sandwiches buttered with nut tose,\r\nand so forth--and lemonade and unfermented wine; and to one of these\r\nsymposia Miss Miniver after a good deal of preliminary solicitude,\r\nconducted Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\nShe was introduced, perhaps a little too obviously for her taste, as\r\na girl who was standing out against her people, to a gathering that\r\nconsisted of a very old lady with an extremely wrinkled skin and a deep\r\nvoice who was wearing what appeared to Ann Veronica\u2019s inexperienced\r\neye to be an antimacassar upon her head, a shy, blond young man with a\r\nnarrow forehead and glasses, two undistinguished women in plain skirts\r\nand blouses, and a middle-aged couple, very fat and alike in black, Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Alderman Dunstable, of the Borough Council of Marylebone.\r\nThese were seated in an imperfect semicircle about a very copper-adorned\r\nfireplace, surmounted by a carved wood inscription:\r\n\r\n\u201cDO IT NOW.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd to them were presently added a roguish-looking young man, with\r\nreddish hair, an orange tie, and a fluffy tweed suit, and others who,\r\nin Ann Veronica\u2019s memory, in spite of her efforts to recall details,\r\nremained obstinately just \u201cothers.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe talk was animated, and remained always brilliant in form even when\r\nit ceased to be brilliant in substance. There were moments when Ann\r\nVeronica rather more than suspected the chief speakers to be, as\r\nschool-boys say, showing off at her.\r\n\r\nThey talked of a new substitute for dripping in vegetarian cookery that\r\nMrs. Goopes was convinced exercised an exceptionally purifying influence\r\non the mind. And then they talked of Anarchism and Socialism, and\r\nwhether the former was the exact opposite of the latter or only a higher\r\nform. The reddish-haired young man contributed allusions to the Hegelian\r\nphilosophy that momentarily confused the discussion. Then Alderman\r\nDunstable, who had hitherto been silent, broke out into speech and went\r\noff at a tangent, and gave his personal impressions of quite a number\r\nof his fellow-councillors. He continued to do this for the rest of the\r\nevening intermittently, in and out, among other topics. He addressed\r\nhimself chiefly to Goopes, and spoke as if in reply to long-sustained\r\ninquiries on the part of Goopes into the personnel of the Marylebone\r\nBorough Council. \u201cIf you were to ask me,\u201d he would say, \u201cI should say\r\nBlinders is straight. An ordinary type, of course--\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Dunstable\u2019s contributions to the conversation were entirely in the\r\nform of nods; whenever Alderman Dunstable praised or blamed she nodded\r\ntwice or thrice, according to the requirements of his emphasis. And\r\nshe seemed always to keep one eye on Ann Veronica\u2019s dress. Mrs.\r\nGoopes disconcerted the Alderman a little by abruptly challenging the\r\nroguish-looking young man in the orange tie (who, it seemed, was the\r\nassistant editor of New Ideas) upon a critique of Nietzsche and Tolstoy\r\nthat had appeared in his paper, in which doubts had been cast upon the\r\nperfect sincerity of the latter. Everybody seemed greatly concerned\r\nabout the sincerity of Tolstoy.\r\n\r\nMiss Miniver said that if once she lost her faith in Tolstoy\u2019s\r\nsincerity, nothing she felt would really matter much any more, and she\r\nappealed to Ann Veronica whether she did not feel the same; and Mr.\r\nGoopes said that we must distinguish between sincerity and irony, which\r\nwas often indeed no more than sincerity at the sublimated level.\r\n\r\nAlderman Dunstable said that sincerity was often a matter of\r\nopportunity, and illustrated the point to the fair young man with an\r\nanecdote about Blinders on the Dust Destructor Committee, during which\r\nthe young man in the orange tie succeeded in giving the whole discussion\r\na daring and erotic flavor by questioning whether any one could be\r\nperfectly sincere in love.\r\n\r\nMiss Miniver thought that there was no true sincerity except in love,\r\nand appealed to Ann Veronica, but the young man in the orange tie went\r\non to declare that it was quite possible to be sincerely in love with\r\ntwo people at the same time, although perhaps on different planes with\r\neach individual, and deceiving them both. But that brought Mrs. Goopes\r\ndown on him with the lesson Titian teaches so beautifully in his \u201cSacred\r\nand Profane Love,\u201d and became quite eloquent upon the impossibility of\r\nany deception in the former.\r\n\r\nThen they discoursed on love for a time, and Alderman Dunstable, turning\r\nback to the shy, blond young man and speaking in undertones of the\r\nutmost clearness, gave a brief and confidential account of an unfounded\r\nrumor of the bifurcation of the affections of Blinders that had led to a\r\nsituation of some unpleasantness upon the Borough Council.\r\n\r\nThe very old lady in the antimacassar touched Ann Veronica\u2019s arm\r\nsuddenly, and said, in a deep, arch voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cTalking of love again; spring again, love again. Oh! you young people!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young man with the orange tie, in spite of Sisyphus-like efforts\r\non the part of Goopes to get the topic on to a higher plane, displayed\r\ngreat persistence in speculating upon the possible distribution of the\r\naffections of highly developed modern types.\r\n\r\nThe old lady in the antimacassar said, abruptly, \u201cAh! you young people,\r\nyou young people, if you only knew!\u201d and then laughed and then mused in\r\na marked manner; and the young man with the narrow forehead and glasses\r\ncleared his throat and asked the young man in the orange tie whether he\r\nbelieved that Platonic love was possible. Mrs. Goopes said she believed\r\nin nothing else, and with that she glanced at Ann Veronica, rose a\r\nlittle abruptly, and directed Goopes and the shy young man in the\r\nhanding of refreshments.\r\n\r\nBut the young man with the orange tie remained in his place, disputing\r\nwhether the body had not something or other which he called its\r\nlegitimate claims. And from that they came back by way of the Kreutzer\r\nSonata and Resurrection to Tolstoy again.\r\n\r\nSo the talk went on. Goopes, who had at first been a little reserved,\r\nresorted presently to the Socratic method to restrain the young man with\r\nthe orange tie, and bent his forehead over him, and brought out at last\r\nvery clearly from him that the body was only illusion and everything\r\nnothing but just spirit and molecules of thought. It became a sort of\r\nduel at last between them, and all the others sat and listened--every\r\none, that is, except the Alderman, who had got the blond young man into\r\na corner by the green-stained dresser with the aluminum things, and was\r\nsitting with his back to every one else, holding one hand over his mouth\r\nfor greater privacy, and telling him, with an accent of confidential\r\nadmission, in whispers of the chronic struggle between the natural\r\nmodesty and general inoffensiveness of the Borough Council and the\r\nsocial evil in Marylebone.\r\n\r\nSo the talk went on, and presently they were criticising novelists, and\r\ncertain daring essays of Wilkins got their due share of attention,\r\nand then they were discussing the future of the theatre. Ann Veronica\r\nintervened a little in the novelist discussion with a defence of Esmond\r\nand a denial that the Egoist was obscure, and when she spoke every one\r\nelse stopped talking and listened. Then they deliberated whether Bernard\r\nShaw ought to go into Parliament. And that brought them to vegetarianism\r\nand teetotalism, and the young man in the orange tie and Mrs. Goopes\r\nhad a great set-to about the sincerity of Chesterton and Belloc that was\r\nended by Goopes showing signs of resuming the Socratic method.\r\n\r\nAnd at last Ann Veronica and Miss Miniver came down the dark staircase\r\nand out into the foggy spaces of the London squares, and crossed Russell\r\nSquare, Woburn Square, Gordon Square, making an oblique route to Ann\r\nVeronica\u2019s lodging. They trudged along a little hungry, because of the\r\nfruitarian refreshments, and mentally very active. And Miss Miniver fell\r\ndiscussing whether Goopes or Bernard Shaw or Tolstoy or Doctor Tumpany\r\nor Wilkins the author had the more powerful and perfect mind in\r\nexistence at the present time. She was clear there were no other minds\r\nlike them in all the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 4\r\n\r\n\r\nThen one evening Ann Veronica went with Miss Miniver into the back seats\r\nof the gallery at Essex Hall, and heard and saw the giant leaders of the\r\nFabian Society who are re-making the world: Bernard Shaw and Toomer and\r\nDoctor Tumpany and Wilkins the author, all displayed upon a platform.\r\nThe place was crowded, and the people about her were almost equally\r\nmade up of very good-looking and enthusiastic young people and a great\r\nvariety of Goopes-like types. In the discussion there was the oddest\r\nmixture of things that were personal and petty with an idealist devotion\r\nthat was fine beyond dispute. In nearly every speech she heard was the\r\nsame implication of great and necessary changes in the world--changes\r\nto be won by effort and sacrifice indeed, but surely to be won. And\r\nafterward she saw a very much larger and more enthusiastic gathering,\r\na meeting of the advanced section of the woman movement in Caxton Hall,\r\nwhere the same note of vast changes in progress sounded; and she went\r\nto a soiree of the Dress Reform Association and visited a Food Reform\r\nExhibition, where imminent change was made even alarmingly visible.\r\nThe women\u2019s meeting was much more charged with emotional force than the\r\nSocialists\u2019. Ann Veronica was carried off her intellectual and critical\r\nfeet by it altogether, and applauded and uttered cries that subsequent\r\nreflection failed to endorse. \u201cI knew you would feel it,\u201d said Miss\r\nMiniver, as they came away flushed and heated. \u201cI knew you would begin\r\nto see how it all falls into place together.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt did begin to fall into place together. She became more and more\r\nalive, not so much to a system of ideas as to a big diffused\r\nimpulse toward change, to a great discontent with and criticism of\r\nlife as it is lived, to a clamorous confusion of ideas for\r\nreconstruction--reconstruction of the methods of business, of economic\r\ndevelopment, of the rules of property, of the status of children, of the\r\nclothing and feeding and teaching of every one; she developed a quite\r\nexaggerated consciousness of a multitude of people going about the\r\nswarming spaces of London with their minds full, their talk and gestures\r\nfull, their very clothing charged with the suggestion of the urgency of\r\nthis pervasive project of alteration. Some indeed carried themselves,\r\ndressed themselves even, rather as foreign visitors from the land\r\nof \u201cLooking Backward\u201d and \u201cNews from Nowhere\u201d than as the indigenous\r\nLondoners they were. For the most part these were detached people: men\r\npractising the plastic arts, young writers, young men in employment, a\r\nvery large proportion of girls and women--self-supporting women or girls\r\nof the student class. They made a stratum into which Ann Veronica was\r\nnow plunged up to her neck; it had become her stratum.\r\n\r\nNone of the things they said and did were altogether new to Ann\r\nVeronica, but now she got them massed and alive, instead of by glimpses\r\nor in books--alive and articulate and insistent. The London backgrounds,\r\nin Bloomsbury and Marylebone, against which these people went to\r\nand fro, took on, by reason of their gray facades, their implacably\r\nrespectable windows and window-blinds, their reiterated unmeaning iron\r\nrailings, a stronger and stronger suggestion of the flavor of her father\r\nat his most obdurate phase, and of all that she felt herself fighting\r\nagainst.\r\n\r\nShe was already a little prepared by her discursive reading and\r\ndiscussion under the Widgett influence for ideas and \u201cmovements,\u201d though\r\ntemperamentally perhaps she was rather disposed to resist and criticise\r\nthan embrace them. But the people among whom she was now thrown through\r\nthe social exertions of Miss Miniver and the Widgetts--for Teddy and\r\nHetty came up from Morningside Park and took her to an eighteen-penny\r\ndinner in Soho and introduced her to some art students, who were also\r\nSocialists, and so opened the way to an evening of meandering talk in a\r\nstudio--carried with them like an atmosphere this implication, not only\r\nthat the world was in some stupid and even obvious way WRONG, with which\r\nindeed she was quite prepared to agree, but that it needed only a\r\nfew pioneers to behave as such and be thoroughly and indiscriminately\r\n\u201cadvanced,\u201d for the new order to achieve itself.\r\n\r\nWhen ninety per cent. out of the ten or twelve people one meets in a\r\nmonth not only say but feel and assume a thing, it is very hard not\r\nto fall into the belief that the thing is so. Imperceptibly almost Ann\r\nVeronica began to acquire the new attitude, even while her mind still\r\nresisted the felted ideas that went with it. And Miss Miniver began to\r\nsway her.\r\n\r\nThe very facts that Miss Miniver never stated an argument clearly, that\r\nshe was never embarrassed by a sense of self-contradiction, and had\r\nlittle more respect for consistency of statement than a washerwoman\r\nhas for wisps of vapor, which made Ann Veronica critical and hostile at\r\ntheir first encounter in Morningside Park, became at last with constant\r\nassociation the secret of Miss Miniver\u2019s growing influence. The brain\r\ntires of resistance, and when it meets again and again, incoherently\r\nactive, the same phrases, the same ideas that it has already slain,\r\nexposed and dissected and buried, it becomes less and less energetic to\r\nrepeat the operation. There must be something, one feels, in ideas that\r\nachieve persistently a successful resurrection. What Miss Miniver would\r\nhave called the Higher Truth supervenes.\r\n\r\nYet through these talks, these meetings and conferences, these movements\r\nand efforts, Ann Veronica, for all that she went with her friend, and\r\nat times applauded with her enthusiastically, yet went nevertheless with\r\neyes that grew more and more puzzled, and fine eyebrows more and more\r\ndisposed to knit. She was with these movements--akin to them, she felt\r\nit at times intensely--and yet something eluded her. Morningside Park\r\nhad been passive and defective; all this rushed about and was active,\r\nbut it was still defective. It still failed in something. It did seem\r\ngermane to the matter that so many of the people \u201cin the van\u201d were plain\r\npeople, or faded people, or tired-looking people. It did affect the\r\nbusiness that they all argued badly and were egotistical in their\r\nmanners and inconsistent in their phrases. There were moments when she\r\ndoubted whether the whole mass of movements and societies and gatherings\r\nand talks was not simply one coherent spectacle of failure protecting\r\nitself from abjection by the glamour of its own assertions. It happened\r\nthat at the extremest point of Ann Veronica\u2019s social circle from the\r\nWidgetts was the family of the Morningside Park horse-dealer, a company\r\nof extremely dressy and hilarious young women, with one equestrian\r\nbrother addicted to fancy waistcoats, cigars, and facial spots. These\r\ngirls wore hats at remarkable angles and bows to startle and kill; they\r\nliked to be right on the spot every time and up to everything that\r\nwas it from the very beginning and they rendered their conception of\r\nSocialists and all reformers by the words \u201cpositively frightening\u201d\r\n and \u201cweird.\u201d Well, it was beyond dispute that these words did convey\r\na certain quality of the Movements in general amid which Miss Miniver\r\ndisported herself. They WERE weird. And yet for all that--\r\n\r\nIt got into Ann Veronica\u2019s nights at last and kept her awake, the\r\nperplexing contrast between the advanced thought and the advanced\r\nthinker. The general propositions of Socialism, for example, struck her\r\nas admirable, but she certainly did not extend her admiration to any\r\nof its exponents. She was still more stirred by the idea of the equal\r\ncitizenship of men and women, by the realization that a big and growing\r\norganization of women were giving form and a generalized expression\r\nto just that personal pride, that aspiration for personal freedom and\r\nrespect which had brought her to London; but when she heard Miss Miniver\r\ndiscoursing on the next step in the suffrage campaign, or read of women\r\nbadgering Cabinet Ministers, padlocked to railings, or getting up in a\r\npublic meeting to pipe out a demand for votes and be carried out kicking\r\nand screaming, her soul revolted. She could not part with dignity.\r\nSomething as yet unformulated within her kept her estranged from all\r\nthese practical aspects of her beliefs.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot for these things, O Ann Veronica, have you revolted,\u201d it said; \u201cand\r\nthis is not your appropriate purpose.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was as if she faced a darkness in which was something very beautiful\r\nand wonderful as yet unimagined. The little pucker in her brows became\r\nmore perceptible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 5\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of December Ann Veronica began to speculate privately\r\nupon the procedure of pawning. She had decided that she would begin\r\nwith her pearl necklace. She spent a very disagreeable afternoon and\r\nevening--it was raining fast outside, and she had very unwisely left\r\nher soundest pair of boots in the boothole of her father\u2019s house in\r\nMorningside Park--thinking over the economic situation and planning a\r\ncourse of action. Her aunt had secretly sent on to Ann Veronica some new\r\nwarm underclothing, a dozen pairs of stockings, and her last winter\u2019s\r\njacket, but the dear lady had overlooked those boots.\r\n\r\nThese things illuminated her situation extremely. Finally she decided\r\nupon a step that had always seemed reasonable to her, but that hitherto\r\nshe had, from motives too faint for her to formulate, refrained from\r\ntaking. She resolved to go into the City to Ramage and ask for his\r\nadvice. And next morning she attired herself with especial care and\r\nneatness, found his address in the Directory at a post-office, and went\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nShe had to wait some minutes in an outer office, wherein three young\r\nmen of spirited costume and appearance regarded her with ill-concealed\r\ncuriosity and admiration. Then Ramage appeared with effusion, and\r\nushered her into his inner apartment. The three young men exchanged\r\nexpressive glances.\r\n\r\nThe inner apartment was rather gracefully furnished with a thick, fine\r\nTurkish carpet, a good brass fender, a fine old bureau, and on the walls\r\nwere engravings of two young girls\u2019 heads by Greuze, and of some modern\r\npicture of boys bathing in a sunlit pool.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut this is a surprise!\u201d said Ramage. \u201cThis is wonderful! I\u2019ve been\r\nfeeling that you had vanished from my world. Have you been away from\r\nMorningside Park?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not interrupting you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are. Splendidly. Business exists for such interruptions. There you\r\nare, the best client\u2019s chair.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica sat down, and Ramage\u2019s eager eyes feasted on her.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been looking out for you,\u201d he said. \u201cI confess it.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe had not, she reflected, remembered how prominent his eyes were.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want some advice,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou remember once, how we talked--at a gate on the Downs? We talked\r\nabout how a girl might get an independent living.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you see, something has happened at home.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe paused.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing has happened to Mr. Stanley?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve fallen out with my father. It was about--a question of what I\r\nmight do or might not do. He--In fact, he--he locked me in my room.\r\nPractically.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer breath left her for a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cI SAY!\u201d said Mr. Ramage.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wanted to go to an art-student ball of which he disapproved.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why shouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI felt that sort of thing couldn\u2019t go on. So I packed up and came to\r\nLondon next day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo a friend?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo lodgings--alone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI say, you know, you have some pluck. You did it on your own?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica smiled. \u201cQuite on my own,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s magnificent!\u201d He leaned back and regarded her with his head a\r\nlittle on one side. \u201cBy Jove!\u201d he said, \u201cthere is something direct about\r\nyou. I wonder if I should have locked you up if I\u2019d been your father.\r\nLuckily I\u2019m not. And you started out forthwith to fight the world and be\r\na citizen on your own basis?\u201d He came forward again and folded his hands\r\nunder him on his desk.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow has the world taken it?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf I was the world I think I\r\nshould have put down a crimson carpet, and asked you to say what you\r\nwanted, and generally walk over me. But the world didn\u2019t do that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot exactly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt presented a large impenetrable back, and went on thinking about\r\nsomething else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt offered from fifteen to two-and-twenty shillings a week--for\r\ndrudgery.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe world has no sense of what is due to youth and courage. It never\r\nhas had.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cBut the thing is, I want a job.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly! And so you came along to me. And you see, I don\u2019t turn my\r\nback, and I am looking at you and thinking about you from top to toe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what do you think I ought to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly!\u201d He lifted a paper-weight and dabbed it gently down again.\r\n\u201cWhat ought you to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve hunted up all sorts of things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe point to note is that fundamentally you don\u2019t want particularly to\r\ndo it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou want to be free and so forth, yes. But you don\u2019t particularly\r\nwant to do the job that sets you free--for its own sake. I mean that it\r\ndoesn\u2019t interest you in itself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of our differences. We men are like children. We can get\r\nabsorbed in play, in games, in the business we do. That\u2019s really why\r\nwe do them sometimes rather well and get on. But women--women as a rule\r\ndon\u2019t throw themselves into things like that. As a matter of fact it\r\nisn\u2019t their affair. And as a natural consequence, they don\u2019t do so well,\r\nand they don\u2019t get on--and so the world doesn\u2019t pay them. They don\u2019t\r\ncatch on to discursive interests, you see, because they are more\r\nserious, they are concentrated on the central reality of life, and a\r\nlittle impatient of its--its outer aspects. At least that, I think, is\r\nwhat makes a clever woman\u2019s independent career so much more difficult\r\nthan a clever man\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t develop a specialty.\u201d Ann Veronica was doing her best to\r\nfollow him.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe has one, that\u2019s why. Her specialty is the central thing in life, it\r\nis life itself, the warmth of life, sex--and love.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe pronounced this with an air of profound conviction and with his\r\neyes on Ann Veronica\u2019s face. He had an air of having told her a deep,\r\npersonal secret. She winced as he thrust the fact at her, was about to\r\nanswer, and checked herself. She colored faintly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t touch the question I asked you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may be\r\ntrue, but it isn\u2019t quite what I have in mind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Ramage, as one who rouses himself from deep\r\npreoccupations And he began to question her in a business-like way upon\r\nthe steps she had taken and the inquiries she had made. He displayed\r\nnone of the airy optimism of their previous talk over the downland gate.\r\nHe was helpful, but gravely dubious. \u201cYou see,\u201d he said, \u201cfrom my point\r\nof view you\u2019re grown up--you\u2019re as old as all the goddesses and the\r\ncontemporary of any man alive. But from the--the economic point of view\r\nyou\u2019re a very young and altogether inexperienced person.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe returned to and developed that idea. \u201cYou\u2019re still,\u201d he said, \u201cin the\r\neducational years. From the point of view of most things in the world\r\nof employment which a woman can do reasonably well and earn a living\r\nby, you\u2019re unripe and half-educated. If you had taken your degree, for\r\nexample.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe spoke of secretarial work, but even there she would need to be able\r\nto do typing and shorthand. He made it more and more evident to her that\r\nher proper course was not to earn a salary but to accumulate equipment.\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are like an inaccessible gold-mine in all this\r\nsort of matter. You\u2019re splendid stuff, you know, but you\u2019ve got nothing\r\nready to sell. That\u2019s the flat business situation.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe thought. Then he slapped his hand on his desk and looked up with\r\nthe air of a man struck by a brilliant idea. \u201cLook here,\u201d he said,\r\nprotruding his eyes; \u201cwhy get anything to do at all just yet? Why, if\r\nyou must be free, why not do the sensible thing? Make yourself worth\r\na decent freedom. Go on with your studies at the Imperial College,\r\nfor example, get a degree, and make yourself good value. Or become a\r\nthorough-going typist and stenographer and secretarial expert.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t do that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, if I do go home my father objects to the College, and as for\r\ntyping--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t go home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but you forget; how am I to live?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEasily. Easily.... Borrow.... From me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t do that,\u201d said Ann Veronica, sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see no reason why you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs one friend to another. Men are always doing it, and if you set up to\r\nbe a man--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s absolutely out of the question, Mr. Ramage.\u201d And Ann\r\nVeronica\u2019s face was hot.\r\n\r\nRamage pursed his rather loose lips and shrugged his shoulders, with\r\nhis eyes fixed steadily upon her. \u201cWell anyhow--I don\u2019t see the force of\r\nyour objection, you know. That\u2019s my advice to you. Here I am. Consider\r\nyou\u2019ve got resources deposited with me. Perhaps at the first blush--it\r\nstrikes you as odd. People are brought up to be so shy about money. As\r\nthough it was indelicate--it\u2019s just a sort of shyness. But here I am to\r\ndraw upon. Here I am as an alternative either to nasty work--or going\r\nhome.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very kind of you--\u201d began Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit. Just a friendly polite suggestion. I don\u2019t suggest any\r\nphilanthropy. I shall charge you five per cent., you know, fair and\r\nsquare.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica opened her lips quickly and did not speak. But the five per\r\ncent. certainly did seem to improve the aspect of Ramage\u2019s suggestion.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, anyhow, consider it open.\u201d He dabbed with his paper-weight again,\r\nand spoke in an entirely indifferent tone. \u201cAnd now tell me, please, how\r\nyou eloped from Morningside Park. How did you get your luggage out of\r\nthe house? Wasn\u2019t it--wasn\u2019t it rather in some respects--rather a lark?\r\nIt\u2019s one of my regrets for my lost youth. I never ran away from anywhere\r\nwith anybody anywhen. And now--I suppose I should be considered too\r\nold. I don\u2019t feel it.... Didn\u2019t you feel rather EVENTFUL--in the\r\ntrain--coming up to Waterloo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 6\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Christmas Ann Veronica had gone to Ramage again and accepted this\r\noffer she had at first declined.\r\n\r\nMany little things had contributed to that decision. The chief influence\r\nwas her awakening sense of the need of money. She had been forced to buy\r\nherself that pair of boots and a walking-skirt, and the pearl necklace\r\nat the pawnbrokers\u2019 had yielded very disappointingly. And, also, she\r\nwanted to borrow that money. It did seem in so many ways exactly what\r\nRamage said it was--the sensible thing to do. There it was--to be\r\nborrowed. It would put the whole adventure on a broader and better\r\nfooting; it seemed, indeed, almost the only possible way in which she\r\nmight emerge from her rebellion with anything like success. If only for\r\nthe sake of her argument with her home, she wanted success. And why,\r\nafter all, should she not borrow money from Ramage?\r\n\r\nIt was so true what he said; middle-class people WERE ridiculously\r\nsqueamish about money. Why should they be?\r\n\r\nShe and Ramage were friends, very good friends. If she was in a position\r\nto help him she would help him; only it happened to be the other way\r\nround. He was in a position to help her. What was the objection?\r\n\r\nShe found it impossible to look her own diffidence in the face. So she\r\nwent to Ramage and came to the point almost at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you spare me forty pounds?\u201d she said.\r\n\r\nMr. Ramage controlled his expression and thought very quickly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d he said, \u201ccertainly,\u201d and drew a checkbook toward him.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s best,\u201d he said, \u201cto make it a good round sum.\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t give you a check though--Yes, I will. I\u2019ll give you an\r\nuncrossed check, and then you can get it at the bank here, quite close\r\nby.... You\u2019d better not have all the money on you; you had better\r\nopen a small account in the post-office and draw it out a fiver at a\r\ntime. That won\u2019t involve references, as a bank account would--and all\r\nthat sort of thing. The money will last longer, and--it won\u2019t bother\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stood up rather close to her and looked into her eyes. He seemed to\r\nbe trying to understand something very perplexing and elusive. \u201cIt\u2019s\r\njolly,\u201d he said, \u201cto feel you have come to me. It\u2019s a sort of guarantee\r\nof confidence. Last time--you made me feel snubbed.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, and went off at a tangent. \u201cThere\u2019s no end of things I\u2019d\r\nlike to talk over with you. It\u2019s just upon my lunch-time. Come and have\r\nlunch with me.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica fenced for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t want to take up your time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe won\u2019t go to any of these City places. They\u2019re just all men, and no\r\none is safe from scandal. But I know a little place where we\u2019ll get a\r\nlittle quiet talk.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica for some indefinable reason did not want to lunch with him,\r\na reason indeed so indefinable that she dismissed it, and Ramage went\r\nthrough the outer office with her, alert and attentive, to the vivid\r\ninterest of the three clerks. The three clerks fought for the only\r\nwindow, and saw her whisked into a hansom. Their subsequent conversation\r\nis outside the scope of our story.\r\n\r\n\u201cRitter\u2019s!\u201d said Ramage to the driver, \u201cDean Street.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was rare that Ann Veronica used hansoms, and to be in one was itself\r\neventful and exhilarating. She liked the high, easy swing of the thing\r\nover its big wheels, the quick clatter-patter of the horse, the passage\r\nof the teeming streets. She admitted her pleasure to Ramage.\r\n\r\nAnd Ritter\u2019s, too, was very amusing and foreign and discreet; a little\r\nrambling room with a number of small tables, with red electric light\r\nshades and flowers. It was an overcast day, albeit not foggy, and\r\nthe electric light shades glowed warmly, and an Italian waiter with\r\ninsufficient English took Ramage\u2019s orders, and waited with an appearance\r\nof affection. Ann Veronica thought the whole affair rather jolly. Ritter\r\nsold better food than most of his compatriots, and cooked it better, and\r\nRamage, with a fine perception of a feminine palate, ordered Vero Capri.\r\nIt was, Ann Veronica felt, as a sip or so of that remarkable blend\r\nwarmed her blood, just the sort of thing that her aunt would not\r\napprove, to be lunching thus, tete-a-tete with a man; and yet at the\r\nsame time it was a perfectly innocent as well as agreeable proceeding.\r\n\r\nThey talked across their meal in an easy and friendly manner about Ann\r\nVeronica\u2019s affairs. He was really very bright and clever, with a sort of\r\nconversational boldness that was just within the limits of permissible\r\ndaring. She described the Goopes and the Fabians to him, and gave him\r\na sketch of her landlady; and he talked in the most liberal and\r\nentertaining way of a modern young woman\u2019s outlook. He seemed to know\r\na great deal about life. He gave glimpses of possibilities. He roused\r\ncuriosities. He contrasted wonderfully with the empty showing-off of\r\nTeddy. His friendship seemed a thing worth having....\r\n\r\nBut when she was thinking it over in her room that evening vague and\r\nbaffling doubts came drifting across this conviction. She doubted how\r\nshe stood toward him and what the restrained gleam of his face might\r\nsignify. She felt that perhaps, in her desire to play an adequate part\r\nin the conversation, she had talked rather more freely than she ought to\r\nhave done, and given him a wrong impression of herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 7\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was two days before Christmas Eve. The next morning came a compact\r\nletter from her father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cMY DEAR DAUGHTER,\u201d it ran,--\u201cHere, on the verge of the season\r\nof forgiveness I hold out a last hand to you in the hope of a\r\nreconciliation. I ask you, although it is not my place to ask you, to\r\nreturn home. This roof is still open to you. You will not be taunted\r\nif you return and everything that can be done will be done to make you\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, I must implore you to return. This adventure of yours has gone\r\non altogether too long; it has become a serious distress to both your\r\naunt and myself. We fail altogether to understand your motives in doing\r\nwhat you are doing, or, indeed, how you are managing to do it, or what\r\nyou are managing on. If you will think only of one trifling aspect--the\r\ninconvenience it must be to us to explain your absence--I think you may\r\nbegin to realize what it all means for us. I need hardly say that your\r\naunt joins with me very heartily in this request.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease come home. You will not find me unreasonable with you.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour affectionate\r\n\r\n\u201cFATHER.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica sat over her fire with her father\u2019s note in her hand.\r\n\u201cQueer letters he writes,\u201d she said. \u201cI suppose most people\u2019s letters\r\nare queer. Roof open--like a Noah\u2019s Ark. I wonder if he really wants me\r\nto go home. It\u2019s odd how little I know of him, and of how he feels and\r\nwhat he feels.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder how he treated Gwen.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer mind drifted into a speculation about her sister. \u201cI ought to look\r\nup Gwen,\u201d she said. \u201cI wonder what happened.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen she fell to thinking about her aunt. \u201cI would like to go home,\u201d she\r\ncried, \u201cto please her. She has been a dear. Considering how little he\r\nlets her have.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe truth prevailed. \u201cThe unaccountable thing is that I wouldn\u2019t go home\r\nto please her. She is, in her way, a dear. One OUGHT to want to please\r\nher. And I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t care. I can\u2019t even make myself care.\u201d\r\n\r\nPresently, as if for comparison with her father\u2019s letter, she got out\r\nRamage\u2019s check from the box that contained her papers. For so far she\r\nhad kept it uncashed. She had not even endorsed it.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuppose I chuck it,\u201d she remarked, standing with the mauve slip in her\r\nhand--\u201csuppose I chuck it, and surrender and go home! Perhaps, after\r\nall, Roddy was right!\r\n\r\n\u201cFather keeps opening the door and shutting it, but a time will come--\r\n\r\n\u201cI could still go home!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe held Ramage\u2019s check as if to tear it across. \u201cNo,\u201d she said at last;\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a human being--not a timid female. What could I do at home? The\r\nother\u2019s a crumple-up--just surrender. Funk! I\u2019ll see it out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE EIGHTH\r\n\r\nBIOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 1\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary found Ann Veronica a student in the biological laboratory of the\r\nCentral Imperial College that towers up from among the back streets in\r\nthe angle between Euston Road and Great Portland Street. She was working\r\nvery steadily at the Advanced Course in Comparative Anatomy, wonderfully\r\nrelieved to have her mind engaged upon one methodically developing theme\r\nin the place of the discursive uncertainties of the previous two months,\r\nand doing her utmost to keep right in the back of her mind and out\r\nof sight the facts, firstly, that she had achieved this haven of\r\nsatisfactory activity by incurring a debt to Ramage of forty pounds,\r\nand, secondly, that her present position was necessarily temporary and\r\nher outlook quite uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe biological laboratory had an atmosphere that was all its own.\r\n\r\nIt was at the top of the building, and looked clear over a clustering\r\nmass of inferior buildings toward Regent\u2019s Park. It was long and narrow,\r\na well-lit, well-ventilated, quiet gallery of small tables and sinks,\r\npervaded by a thin smell of methylated spirit and of a mitigated\r\nand sterilized organic decay. Along the inner side was a wonderfully\r\narranged series of displayed specimens that Russell himself had\r\nprepared. The supreme effect for Ann Veronica was its surpassing\r\nrelevance; it made every other atmosphere she knew seem discursive and\r\nconfused. The whole place and everything in it aimed at one thing--to\r\nillustrate, to elaborate, to criticise and illuminate, and make ever\r\nplainer and plainer the significance of animal and vegetable structure.\r\nIt dealt from floor to ceiling and end to end with the Theory of the\r\nForms of Life; the very duster by the blackboard was there to do its\r\nshare in that work, the very washers in the taps; the room was more\r\nsimply concentrated in aim even than a church. To that, perhaps, a\r\nlarge part of its satisfyingness was due. Contrasted with the confused\r\nmovement and presences of a Fabian meeting, or the inexplicable\r\nenthusiasm behind the suffrage demand, with the speeches that were\r\npartly egotistical displays, partly artful manoeuvres, and partly\r\nincoherent cries for unsoundly formulated ends, compared with the\r\ncomings and goings of audiences and supporters that were like the\r\neddy-driven drift of paper in the street, this long, quiet, methodical\r\nchamber shone like a star seen through clouds.\r\n\r\nDay after day for a measured hour in the lecture-theatre, with elaborate\r\npower and patience, Russell pieced together difficulty and suggestion,\r\ninstance and counter-instance, in the elaborate construction of the\r\nfamily tree of life. And then the students went into the long laboratory\r\nand followed out these facts in almost living tissue with microscope and\r\nscalpel, probe and microtome, and the utmost of their skill and care,\r\nmaking now and then a raid into the compact museum of illustration next\r\ndoor, in which specimens and models and directions stood in disciplined\r\nranks, under the direction of the demonstrator Capes. There was a couple\r\nof blackboards at each end of the aisle of tables, and at these Capes,\r\nwith quick and nervous speech that contrasted vividly with Russell\u2019s\r\nslow, definitive articulation, directed the dissection and made\r\nilluminating comments on the structures under examination. Then he\r\nwould come along the laboratory, sitting down by each student in\r\nturn, checking the work and discussing its difficulties, and answering\r\nquestions arising out of Russell\u2019s lecture.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica had come to the Imperial College obsessed by the\r\ngreat figure of Russell, by the part he had played in the Darwinian\r\ncontroversies, and by the resolute effect of the grim-lipped, yellow,\r\nleonine face beneath the mane of silvery hair. Capes was rather a\r\ndiscovery. Capes was something superadded. Russell burned like a beacon,\r\nbut Capes illuminated by darting flashes and threw light, even if it\r\nwas but momentary light, into a hundred corners that Russell left\r\nsteadfastly in the shade.\r\n\r\nCapes was an exceptionally fair man of two or three-and-thirty, so\r\nruddily blond that it was a mercy he had escaped light eyelashes, and\r\nwith a minor but by no means contemptible reputation of his own. He\r\ntalked at the blackboard in a pleasant, very slightly lisping voice with\r\na curious spontaneity, and was sometimes very clumsy in his exposition,\r\nand sometimes very vivid. He dissected rather awkwardly and hurriedly,\r\nbut, on the whole, effectively, and drew with an impatient directness\r\nthat made up in significance what it lacked in precision. Across the\r\nblackboard the colored chalks flew like flights of variously tinted\r\nrockets as diagram after diagram flickered into being.\r\n\r\nThere happened that year to be an unusual proportion of girls and women\r\nin the advanced laboratory, perhaps because the class as a whole was an\r\nexceptionally small one. It numbered nine, and four of these were women\r\nstudents. As a consequence of its small size, it was possible to get\r\nalong with the work on a much easier and more colloquial footing than\r\na larger class would have permitted. And a custom had grown up of a\r\ngeneral tea at four o\u2019clock, under the auspices of a Miss Garvice, a\r\ntall and graceful girl of distinguished intellectual incompetence, in\r\nwhom the hostess instinct seemed to be abnormally developed.\r\n\r\nCapes would come to these teas; he evidently liked to come, and he\r\nwould appear in the doorway of the preparation-room, a pleasing note of\r\nshyness in his manner, hovering for an invitation.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, Ann Veronica found him an exceptionally interesting man.\r\nTo begin with, he struck her as being the most variable person she had\r\never encountered. At times he was brilliant and masterful, talked round\r\nand over every one, and would have been domineering if he had not\r\nbeen extraordinarily kindly; at times he was almost monosyllabic, and\r\ndefeated Miss Garvice\u2019s most skilful attempts to draw him out. Sometimes\r\nhe was obviously irritable and uncomfortable and unfortunate in his\r\nefforts to seem at ease. And sometimes he overflowed with a peculiarly\r\nmalignant wit that played, with devastating effect, upon any topics that\r\nhad the courage to face it. Ann Veronica\u2019s experiences of men had been\r\namong more stable types--Teddy, who was always absurd; her father,\r\nwho was always authoritative and sentimental; Manning, who was always\r\nManning. And most of the others she had met had, she felt, the same\r\nsteadfastness. Goopes, she was sure was always high-browed and slow and\r\nSocratic. And Ramage too--about Ramage there would always be that air of\r\navidity, that air of knowledge and inquiry, the mixture of things in his\r\ntalk that were rather good with things that were rather poor. But one\r\ncould not count with any confidence upon Capes.\r\n\r\nThe five men students were a mixed company. There was a very white-faced\r\nyoungster of eighteen who brushed back his hair exactly in Russell\u2019s\r\nmanner, and was disposed to be uncomfortably silent when he was\r\nnear her, and to whom she felt it was only Christian kindness to be\r\nconsistently pleasant; and a lax young man of five-and-twenty in navy\r\nblue, who mingled Marx and Bebel with the more orthodox gods of the\r\nbiological pantheon. There was a short, red-faced, resolute youth who\r\ninherited an authoritative attitude upon bacteriology from his father;\r\na Japanese student of unassuming manners who drew beautifully and had\r\nan imperfect knowledge of English; and a dark, unwashed Scotchman\r\nwith complicated spectacles, who would come every morning as a sort of\r\nvolunteer supplementary demonstrator, look very closely at her work\r\nand her, tell her that her dissections were \u201cfairish,\u201d or \u201cvery fairish\r\nindeed,\u201d or \u201chigh above the normal female standard,\u201d hover as if for\r\nsome outbreak of passionate gratitude and with admiring retrospects\r\nthat made the facetted spectacles gleam like diamonds, return to his own\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe women, Ann Veronica thought, were not quite so interesting as the\r\nmen. There were two school-mistresses, one of whom--Miss Klegg--might\r\nhave been a first cousin to Miss Miniver, she had so many Miniver\r\ntraits; there was a preoccupied girl whose name Ann Veronica never\r\nlearned, but who worked remarkably well; and Miss Garvice, who began\r\nby attracting her very greatly--she moved so beautifully--and ended by\r\ngiving her the impression that moving beautifully was the beginning and\r\nend of her being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next few weeks were a time of the very liveliest thought and growth\r\nfor Ann Veronica. The crowding impressions of the previous weeks seemed\r\nto run together directly her mind left the chaotic search for employment\r\nand came into touch again with a coherent and systematic development\r\nof ideas. The advanced work at the Central Imperial College was in the\r\nclosest touch with living interests and current controversies; it drew\r\nits illustrations and material from Russell\u2019s two great researches--upon\r\nthe relation of the brachiopods to the echinodermata, and upon the\r\nsecondary and tertiary mammalian and pseudo-mammalian factors in the\r\nfree larval forms of various marine organisms. Moreover, a vigorous fire\r\nof mutual criticism was going on now between the Imperial College and\r\nthe Cambridge Mendelians and echoed in the lectures. From beginning to\r\nend it was first-hand stuff.\r\n\r\nBut the influence of the science radiated far beyond its own special\r\nfield--beyond those beautiful but highly technical problems with which\r\nwe do not propose for a moment to trouble the naturally terrified\r\nreader. Biology is an extraordinarily digestive science. It throws out a\r\nnumber of broad experimental generalizations, and then sets out to\r\nbring into harmony or relation with these an infinitely multifarious\r\ncollection of phenomena. The little streaks upon the germinating area\r\nof an egg, the nervous movements of an impatient horse, the trick of\r\na calculating boy, the senses of a fish, the fungus at the root of a\r\ngarden flower, and the slime upon a sea-wet rock--ten thousand such\r\nthings bear their witness and are illuminated. And not only did these\r\ntentacular generalizations gather all the facts of natural history and\r\ncomparative anatomy together, but they seemed always stretching out\r\nfurther and further into a world of interests that lay altogether\r\noutside their legitimate bounds.\r\n\r\nIt came to Ann Veronica one night after a long talk with Miss Miniver,\r\nas a sudden remarkable thing, as a grotesque, novel aspect, that this\r\nslowly elaborating biological scheme had something more than an academic\r\ninterest for herself. And not only so, but that it was after all, a more\r\nsystematic and particular method of examining just the same questions\r\nthat underlay the discussions of the Fabian Society, the talk of the\r\nWest Central Arts Club, the chatter of the studios and the deep, the\r\nbottomless discussions of the simple-life homes. It was the same Bios\r\nwhose nature and drift and ways and methods and aspects engaged\r\nthem all. And she, she in her own person too, was this eternal Bios,\r\nbeginning again its recurrent journey to selection and multiplication\r\nand failure or survival.\r\n\r\nBut this was but a momentary gleam of personal application, and at this\r\ntime she followed it up no further.\r\n\r\nAnd now Ann Veronica\u2019s evenings were also becoming very busy. She\r\npursued her interest in the Socialist movement and in the Suffragist\r\nagitation in the company of Miss Miniver. They went to various central\r\nand local Fabian gatherings, and to a number of suffrage meetings. Teddy\r\nWidgett hovered on the fringe of all these gatherings, blinking at Ann\r\nVeronica and occasionally making a wildly friendly dash at her, and\r\ncarrying her and Miss Miniver off to drink cocoa with a choice diversity\r\nof other youthful and congenial Fabians after the meetings. Then Mr.\r\nManning loomed up ever and again into her world, full of a futile\r\nsolicitude, and almost always declaring she was splendid, splendid, and\r\nwishing he could talk things out with her. Teas he contributed to the\r\ncommissariat of Ann Veronica\u2019s campaign--quite a number of teas. He\r\nwould get her to come to tea with him, usually in a pleasant tea-room\r\nover a fruit-shop in Tottenham Court Road, and he would discuss his own\r\npoint of view and hint at a thousand devotions were she but to command\r\nhim. And he would express various artistic sensibilities and aesthetic\r\nappreciations in carefully punctuated sentences and a large, clear\r\nvoice. At Christmas he gave her a set of a small edition of Meredith\u2019s\r\nnovels, very prettily bound in flexible leather, being guided in the\r\nchoice of an author, as he intimated, rather by her preferences than his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThere was something markedly and deliberately liberal-minded in his\r\nmanner in all their encounters. He conveyed not only his sense of the\r\nextreme want of correctitude in their unsanctioned meetings, but also\r\nthat, so far as he was concerned, this irregularity mattered not at\r\nall, that he had flung--and kept on flinging--such considerations to the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nAnd, in addition, she was now seeing and talking to Ramage almost\r\nweekly, on a theory which she took very gravely, that they were\r\nexceptionally friends. He would ask her to come to dinner with him in\r\nsome little Italian or semi-Bohemian restaurant in the district toward\r\nSoho, or in one of the more stylish and magnificent establishments about\r\nPiccadilly Circus, and for the most part she did not care to refuse.\r\nNor, indeed, did she want to refuse. These dinners, from their lavish\r\ndisplay of ambiguous hors d\u2019oeuvre to their skimpy ices in dishes of\r\nfrilled paper, with their Chianti flasks and Parmesan dishes and their\r\npolyglot waiters and polyglot clientele, were very funny and bright;\r\nand she really liked Ramage, and valued his help and advice. It was\r\ninteresting to see how different and characteristic his mode of approach\r\nwas to all sorts of questions that interested her, and it was amusing to\r\ndiscover this other side to the life of a Morningside Park inhabitant.\r\nShe had thought that all Morningside Park householders came home before\r\nseven at the latest, as her father usually did. Ramage talked always\r\nabout women or some woman\u2019s concern, and very much about Ann Veronica\u2019s\r\nown outlook upon life. He was always drawing contrasts between a woman\u2019s\r\nlot and a man\u2019s, and treating her as a wonderful new departure in this\r\ncomparison. Ann Veronica liked their relationship all the more because\r\nit was an unusual one.\r\n\r\nAfter these dinners they would have a walk, usually to the Thames\r\nEmbankment to see the two sweeps of river on either side of Waterloo\r\nBridge; and then they would part at Westminster Bridge, perhaps, and\r\nhe would go on to Waterloo. Once he suggested they should go to a\r\nmusic-hall and see a wonderful new dancer, but Ann Veronica did not feel\r\nshe cared to see a new dancer. So, instead, they talked of dancing\r\nand what it might mean in a human life. Ann Veronica thought it was\r\na spontaneous release of energy expressive of well-being, but Ramage\r\nthought that by dancing, men, and such birds and animals as dance, come\r\nto feel and think of their bodies.\r\n\r\nThis intercourse, which had been planned to warm Ann Veronica to a\r\nfamiliar affection with Ramage, was certainly warming Ramage to a\r\nconstantly deepening interest in Ann Veronica. He felt that he was\r\ngetting on with her very slowly indeed, but he did not see how he could\r\nget on faster. He had, he felt, to create certain ideas and vivify\r\ncertain curiosities and feelings in her. Until that was done a certain\r\nexperience of life assured him that a girl is a locked coldness against\r\na man\u2019s approach. She had all the fascination of being absolutely\r\nperplexing in this respect. On the one hand, she seemed to think plainly\r\nand simply, and would talk serenely and freely about topics that most\r\nwomen have been trained either to avoid or conceal; and on the other she\r\nwas unconscious, or else she had an air of being unconscious--that was\r\nthe riddle--to all sorts of personal applications that almost any girl\r\nor woman, one might have thought, would have made. He was always doing\r\nhis best to call her attention to the fact that he was a man of spirit\r\nand quality and experience, and she a young and beautiful woman, and\r\nthat all sorts of constructions upon their relationship were possible,\r\ntrusting her to go on from that to the idea that all sorts of\r\nrelationships were possible. She responded with an unfaltering\r\nappearance of insensibility, and never as a young and beautiful woman\r\nconscious of sex; always in the character of an intelligent girl\r\nstudent.\r\n\r\nHis perception of her personal beauty deepened and quickened with each\r\nencounter. Every now and then her general presence became radiantly\r\ndazzling in his eyes; she would appear in the street coming toward him,\r\na surprise, so fine and smiling and welcoming was she, so expanded and\r\nilluminated and living, in contrast with his mere expectation. Or he\r\nwould find something--a wave in her hair, a little line in the contour\r\nof her brow or neck, that made an exquisite discovery.\r\n\r\nHe was beginning to think about her inordinately. He would sit in\r\nhis inner office and compose conversations with her, penetrating,\r\nilluminating, and nearly conclusive--conversations that never proved to\r\nbe of the slightest use at all with her when he met her face to face.\r\nAnd he began also at times to wake at night and think about her.\r\n\r\nHe thought of her and himself, and no longer in that vein of incidental\r\nadventure in which he had begun. He thought, too, of the fretful invalid\r\nwho lay in the next room to his, whose money had created his business\r\nand made his position in the world.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve had most of the things I wanted,\u201d said Ramage, in the stillness of\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a time Ann Veronica\u2019s family had desisted from direct offers of a\r\nfree pardon; they were evidently waiting for her resources to come to\r\nan end. Neither father, aunt, nor brothers made a sign, and then\r\none afternoon in early February her aunt came up in a state between\r\nexpostulation and dignified resentment, but obviously very anxious for\r\nAnn Veronica\u2019s welfare. \u201cI had a dream in the night,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw\r\nyou in a sort of sloping, slippery place, holding on by your hands and\r\nslipping. You seemed to me to be slipping and slipping, and your face\r\nwas white. It was really most vivid, most vivid! You seemed to be\r\nslipping and just going to tumble and holding on. It made me wake up,\r\nand there I lay thinking of you, spending your nights up here all alone,\r\nand no one to look after you. I wondered what you could be doing and\r\nwhat might be happening to you. I said to myself at once, \u2018Either this\r\nis a coincidence or the caper sauce.\u2019 But I made sure it was you. I felt\r\nI MUST do something anyhow, and up I came just as soon as I could to see\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe had spoken rather rapidly. \u201cI can\u2019t help saying it,\u201d she said, with\r\nthe quality of her voice altering, \u201cbut I do NOT think it is right for\r\nan unprotected girl to be in London alone as you are.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m quite equal to taking care of myself, aunt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must be most uncomfortable here. It is most uncomfortable for every\r\none concerned.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe spoke with a certain asperity. She felt that Ann Veronica had duped\r\nher in that dream, and now that she had come up to London she might as\r\nwell speak her mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo Christmas dinner,\u201d she said, \u201cor anything nice! One doesn\u2019t even\r\nknow what you are doing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going on working for my degree.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you do that at home?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m working at the Imperial College. You see, aunt, it\u2019s the only\r\npossible way for me to get a good degree in my subjects, and father\r\nwon\u2019t hear of it. There\u2019d only be endless rows if I was at home. And how\r\ncould I come home--when he locks me in rooms and all that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do wish this wasn\u2019t going on,\u201d said Miss Stanley, after a pause. \u201cI\r\ndo wish you and your father could come to some agreement.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica responded with conviction: \u201cI wish so, too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t we arrange something? Can\u2019t we make a sort of treaty?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t keep it. He would get very cross one evening and no one\r\nwould dare to remind him of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can you say such things?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut he would!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStill, it isn\u2019t your place to say so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt prevents a treaty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t _I_ make a treaty?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica thought, and could not see any possible treaty that would\r\nleave it open for her to have quasi-surreptitious dinners with Ramage\r\nor go on walking round the London squares discussing Socialism with Miss\r\nMiniver toward the small hours. She had tasted freedom now, and so far\r\nshe had not felt the need of protection. Still, there certainly was\r\nsomething in the idea of a treaty.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see at all how you can be managing,\u201d said Miss Stanley, and Ann\r\nVeronica hastened to reply, \u201cI do on very little.\u201d Her mind went back to\r\nthat treaty.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd aren\u2019t there fees to pay at the Imperial College?\u201d her aunt was\r\nsaying--a disagreeable question.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are a few fees.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen how have you managed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBother!\u201d said Ann Veronica to herself, and tried not to look guilty. \u201cI\r\nwas able to borrow the money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBorrow the money! But who lent you the money?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA friend,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\nShe felt herself getting into a corner. She sought hastily in her mind\r\nfor a plausible answer to an obvious question that didn\u2019t come. Her aunt\r\nwent off at a tangent. \u201cBut my dear Ann Veronica, you will be getting\r\ninto debt!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica at once, and with a feeling of immense relief, took refuge\r\nin her dignity. \u201cI think, aunt,\u201d she said, \u201cyou might trust to my\r\nself-respect to keep me out of that.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor the moment her aunt could not think of any reply to this\r\ncounterstroke, and Ann Veronica followed up her advantage by a sudden\r\ninquiry about her abandoned boots.\r\n\r\nBut in the train going home her aunt reasoned it out.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf she is borrowing money,\u201d said Miss Stanley, \u201cshe MUST be getting\r\ninto debt. It\u2019s all nonsense....\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 4\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was by imperceptible degrees that Capes became important in Ann\r\nVeronica\u2019s thoughts. But then he began to take steps, and, at last,\r\nstrides to something more and more like predominance. She began by being\r\ninterested in his demonstrations and his biological theory, then she was\r\nattracted by his character, and then, in a manner, she fell in love with\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\nOne day they were at tea in the laboratory and a discussion sprang up\r\nabout the question of women\u2019s suffrage. The movement was then in its\r\nearlier militant phases, and one of the women only, Miss Garvice,\r\nopposed it, though Ann Veronica was disposed to be lukewarm. But a man\u2019s\r\nopposition always inclined her to the suffrage side; she had a curious\r\nfeeling of loyalty in seeing the more aggressive women through. Capes\r\nwas irritatingly judicial in the matter, neither absurdly against, in\r\nwhich case one might have smashed him, or hopelessly undecided, but\r\ntepidly sceptical. Miss Klegg and the youngest girl made a vigorous\r\nattack on Miss Garvice, who had said she thought women lost something\r\ninfinitely precious by mingling in the conflicts of life. The discussion\r\nwandered, and was punctuated with bread and butter. Capes was inclined\r\nto support Miss Klegg until Miss Garvice cornered him by quoting him\r\nagainst himself, and citing a recent paper in the Nineteenth Century, in\r\nwhich, following Atkinson, he had made a vigorous and damaging attack\r\non Lester Ward\u2019s case for the primitive matriarchate and the predominant\r\nimportance of the female throughout the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica was not aware of this literary side of her teacher; she had\r\na little tinge of annoyance at Miss Garvice\u2019s advantage. Afterwards\r\nshe hunted up the article in question, and it seemed to her quite\r\ndelightfully written and argued. Capes had the gift of easy, unaffected\r\nwriting, coupled with very clear and logical thinking, and to follow\r\nhis written thought gave her the sensation of cutting things with a\r\nperfectly new, perfectly sharp knife. She found herself anxious to read\r\nmore of him, and the next Wednesday she went to the British Museum and\r\nhunted first among the half-crown magazines for his essays and then\r\nthrough various scientific quarterlies for his research papers. The\r\nordinary research paper, when it is not extravagant theorizing, is apt\r\nto be rather sawdusty in texture, and Ann Veronica was delighted to find\r\nthe same easy and confident luminosity that distinguished his work for\r\nthe general reader. She returned to these latter, and at the back of\r\nher mind, as she looked them over again, was a very distinct resolve\r\nto quote them after the manner of Miss Garvice at the very first\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nWhen she got home to her lodgings that evening she reflected with\r\nsomething like surprise upon her half-day\u2019s employment, and decided\r\nthat it showed nothing more nor less than that Capes was a really very\r\ninteresting person indeed.\r\n\r\nAnd then she fell into a musing about Capes. She wondered why he was so\r\ndistinctive, so unlike other men, and it never occurred to her for some\r\ntime that this might be because she was falling in love with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 5\r\n\r\n\r\nYet Ann Veronica was thinking a very great deal about love. A dozen\r\nshynesses and intellectual barriers were being outflanked or broken\r\ndown in her mind. All the influences about her worked with her own\r\npredisposition and against all the traditions of her home and upbringing\r\nto deal with the facts of life in an unabashed manner. Ramage, by a\r\nhundred skilful hints had led her to realize that the problem of her own\r\nlife was inseparably associated with, and indeed only one special case\r\nof, the problems of any woman\u2019s life, and that the problem of a woman\u2019s\r\nlife is love.\r\n\r\n\u201cA young man comes into life asking how best he may place himself,\u201d\r\n Ramage had said; \u201ca woman comes into life thinking instinctively how\r\nbest she may give herself.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe noted that as a good saying, and it germinated and spread tentacles\r\nof explanation through her brain. The biological laboratory, perpetually\r\nviewing life as pairing and breeding and selection, and again pairing\r\nand breeding, seemed only a translated generalization of that assertion.\r\nAnd all the talk of the Miniver people and the Widgett people seemed\r\nalways to be like a ship in adverse weather on the lee shore of love.\r\n\u201cFor seven years,\u201d said Ann Veronica, \u201cI have been trying to keep myself\r\nfrom thinking about love....\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been training myself to look askance at beautiful things.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe gave herself permission now to look at this squarely. She made\r\nherself a private declaration of liberty. \u201cThis is mere nonsense, mere\r\ntongue-tied fear!\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the slavery of the veiled life.\r\nI might as well be at Morningside Park. This business of love is the\r\nsupreme affair in life, it is the woman\u2019s one event and crisis that\r\nmakes up for all her other restrictions, and I cower--as we all\r\ncower--with a blushing and paralyzed mind until it overtakes me!...\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be hanged if I do.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut she could not talk freely about love, she found, for all that\r\nmanumission.\r\n\r\nRamage seemed always fencing about the forbidden topic, probing for\r\nopenings, and she wondered why she did not give him them. But something\r\ninstinctive prevented that, and with the finest resolve not to be\r\n\u201csilly\u201d and prudish she found that whenever he became at all bold\r\nin this matter she became severely scientific and impersonal, almost\r\nentomological indeed, in her method; she killed every remark as he made\r\nit and pinned it out for examination. In the biological laboratory that\r\nwas their invincible tone. But she disapproved more and more of her own\r\nmental austerity. Here was an experienced man of the world, her friend,\r\nwho evidently took a great interest in this supreme topic and was\r\nwilling to give her the benefit of his experiences! Why should not she\r\nbe at her ease with him? Why should not she know things? It is hard\r\nenough anyhow for a human being to learn, she decided, but it is a dozen\r\ntimes more difficult than it need be because of all this locking of the\r\nlips and thoughts.\r\n\r\nShe contrived to break down the barriers of shyness at last in one\r\ndirection, and talked one night of love and the facts of love with Miss\r\nMiniver.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Miniver was highly unsatisfactory. She repeated phrases of Mrs.\r\nGoopes\u2019s: \u201cAdvanced people,\u201d she said, with an air of great elucidation,\r\n\u201ctend to GENERALIZE love. \u2018He prayeth best who loveth best--all things\r\nboth great and small.\u2019 For my own part I go about loving.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but men;\u201d said Ann Veronica, plunging; \u201cdon\u2019t you want the love of\r\nmen?\u201d\r\n\r\nFor some seconds they remained silent, both shocked by this question.\r\n\r\nMiss Miniver looked over her glasses at her friend almost balefully.\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d she said, at last, with something in her voice that reminded Ann\r\nVeronica of a sprung tennis-racket.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through all that,\u201d she went on, after a pause.\r\n\r\nShe spoke slowly. \u201cI have never yet met a man whose intellect I could\r\nrespect.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica looked at her thoughtfully for a moment, and decided to\r\npersist on principle.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut if you had?\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine it,\u201d said Miss Miniver. \u201cAnd think, think\u201d--her voice\r\nsank--\u201cof the horrible coarseness!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat coarseness?\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Vee!\u201d Her voice became very low. \u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! I know--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell--\u201d Her face was an unaccustomed pink.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica ignored her friend\u2019s confusion.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t we all rather humbug about the coarseness? All we women, I mean,\u201d\r\n said she. She decided to go on, after a momentary halt. \u201cWe pretend\r\nbodies are ugly. Really they are the most beautiful things in the world.\r\nWe pretend we never think of everything that makes us what we are.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d cried Miss Miniver, almost vehemently. \u201cYou are wrong! I did not\r\nthink you thought such things. Bodies! Bodies! Horrible things! We are\r\nsouls. Love lives on a higher plane. We are not animals. If ever I\r\ndid meet a man I could love, I should love him\u201d--her voice dropped\r\nagain--\u201cplatonically.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe made her glasses glint. \u201cAbsolutely platonically,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cSoul to soul.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe turned her face to the fire, gripped her hands upon her elbows, and\r\ndrew her thin shoulders together in a shrug. \u201cUgh!\u201d she said.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica watched her and wondered about her.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe do not want the men,\u201d said Miss Miniver; \u201cwe do not want them, with\r\ntheir sneers and loud laughter. Empty, silly, coarse brutes. Brutes!\r\nThey are the brute still with us! Science some day may teach us a way\r\nto do without them. It is only the women matter. It is not every sort of\r\ncreature needs--these males. Some have no males.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s green-fly,\u201d admitted Ann Veronica. \u201cAnd even then--\u201d\r\n\r\nThe conversation hung for a thoughtful moment.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica readjusted her chin on her hand. \u201cI wonder which of us is\r\nright,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t a scrap--of this sort of aversion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTolstoy is so good about this,\u201d said Miss Miniver, regardless of her\r\nfriend\u2019s attitude. \u201cHe sees through it all. The Higher Life and the\r\nLower. He sees men all defiled by coarse thoughts, coarse ways of living\r\ncruelties. Simply because they are hardened by--by bestiality,\r\nand poisoned by the juices of meat slain in anger and fermented\r\ndrinks--fancy! drinks that have been swarmed in by thousands and\r\nthousands of horrible little bacteria!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s yeast,\u201d said Ann Veronica--\u201ca vegetable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all the same,\u201d said Miss Miniver. \u201cAnd then they are swollen up\r\nand inflamed and drunken with matter. They are blinded to all fine\r\nand subtle things--they look at life with bloodshot eyes and dilated\r\nnostrils. They are arbitrary and unjust and dogmatic and brutish and\r\nlustful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut do you really think men\u2019s minds are altered by the food they eat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know it,\u201d said Miss Miniver. \u201cExperte credo. When I am leading a true\r\nlife, a pure and simple life free of all stimulants and excitements, I\r\nthink--I think--oh! with pellucid clearness; but if I so much as take a\r\nmouthful of meat--or anything--the mirror is all blurred.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 6\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, arising she knew not how, like a new-born appetite, came a craving\r\nin Ann Veronica for the sight and sound of beauty.\r\n\r\nIt was as if her aesthetic sense had become inflamed. Her mind turned\r\nand accused itself of having been cold and hard. She began to look for\r\nbeauty and discover it in unexpected aspects and places. Hitherto she\r\nhad seen it chiefly in pictures and other works of art, incidentally,\r\nand as a thing taken out of life. Now the sense of beauty was spreading\r\nto a multitude of hitherto unsuspected aspects of the world about her.\r\n\r\nThe thought of beauty became an obsession. It interwove with her\r\nbiological work. She found herself asking more and more curiously, \u201cWhy,\r\non the principle of the survival of the fittest, have I any sense of\r\nbeauty at all?\u201d That enabled her to go on thinking about beauty when it\r\nseemed to her right that she should be thinking about biology.\r\n\r\nShe was very greatly exercised by the two systems of values--the two\r\nseries of explanations that her comparative anatomy on the one hand and\r\nher sense of beauty on the other, set going in her thoughts. She could\r\nnot make up her mind which was the finer, more elemental thing, which\r\ngave its values to the other. Was it that the struggle of things\r\nto survive produced as a sort of necessary by-product these intense\r\npreferences and appreciations, or was it that some mystical outer thing,\r\nsome great force, drove life beautyward, even in spite of expediency,\r\nregardless of survival value and all the manifest discretions of life?\r\nShe went to Capes with that riddle and put it to him very carefully and\r\nclearly, and he talked well--he always talked at some length when she\r\ntook a difficulty to him--and sent her to a various literature upon the\r\nmarkings of butterflies, the incomprehensible elaboration and splendor\r\nof birds of Paradise and humming-birds\u2019 plumes, the patterning of\r\ntigers, and a leopard\u2019s spots. He was interesting and inconclusive, and\r\nthe original papers to which he referred her discursive were at best\r\nonly suggestive. Afterward, one afternoon, he hovered about her, and\r\ncame and sat beside her and talked of beauty and the riddle of beauty\r\nfor some time. He displayed a quite unprofessional vein of mysticism in\r\nthe matter. He contrasted with Russell, whose intellectual methods were,\r\nso to speak, sceptically dogmatic. Their talk drifted to the beauty of\r\nmusic, and they took that up again at tea-time.\r\n\r\nBut as the students sat about Miss Garvice\u2019s tea-pot and drank tea or\r\nsmoked cigarettes, the talk got away from Capes. The Scotchman informed\r\nAnn Veronica that your view of beauty necessarily depended on your\r\nmetaphysical premises, and the young man with the Russell-like hair\r\nbecame anxious to distinguish himself by telling the Japanese student\r\nthat Western art was symmetrical and Eastern art asymmetrical, and that\r\namong the higher organisms the tendency was toward an external symmetry\r\nveiling an internal want of balance. Ann Veronica decided she would have\r\nto go on with Capes another day, and, looking up, discovered him sitting\r\non a stool with his hands in his pockets and his head a little on one\r\nside, regarding her with a thoughtful expression. She met his eye for a\r\nmoment in curious surprise.\r\n\r\nHe turned his eyes and stared at Miss Garvice like one who wakes from\r\na reverie, and then got up and strolled down the laboratory toward his\r\nrefuge, the preparation-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 7\r\n\r\n\r\nThen one day a little thing happened that clothed itself in\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nShe had been working upon a ribbon of microtome sections of the\r\ndeveloping salamander, and he came to see what she had made of them. She\r\nstood up and he sat down at the microscope, and for a time he was busy\r\nscrutinizing one section after another. She looked down at him and saw\r\nthat the sunlight was gleaming from his cheeks, and that all over\r\nhis cheeks was a fine golden down of delicate hairs. And at the sight\r\nsomething leaped within her.\r\n\r\nSomething changed for her.\r\n\r\nShe became aware of his presence as she had never been aware of any\r\nhuman being in her life before. She became aware of the modelling of his\r\near, of the muscles of his neck and the textures of the hair that came\r\noff his brow, the soft minute curve of eyelid that she could just see\r\nbeyond his brow; she perceived all these familiar objects as though\r\nthey were acutely beautiful things. They WERE, she realized, acutely\r\nbeautiful things. Her sense followed the shoulders under his coat, down\r\nto where his flexible, sensitive-looking hand rested lightly upon the\r\ntable. She felt him as something solid and strong and trustworthy beyond\r\nmeasure. The perception of him flooded her being.\r\n\r\nHe got up. \u201cHere\u2019s something rather good,\u201d he said, and with a start and\r\nan effort she took his place at the microscope, while he stood beside\r\nher and almost leaning over her.\r\n\r\nShe found she was trembling at his nearness and full of a thrilling\r\ndread that he might touch her. She pulled herself together and put her\r\neye to the eye-piece.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see the pointer?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see the pointer,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like this,\u201d he said, and dragged a stool beside her and sat down\r\nwith his elbow four inches from hers and made a sketch. Then he got up\r\nand left her.\r\n\r\nShe had a feeling at his departure as of an immense cavity, of something\r\nenormously gone; she could not tell whether it was infinite regret or\r\ninfinite relief....\r\n\r\nBut now Ann Veronica knew what was the matter with her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 8\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd as she sat on her bed that night, musing and half-undressed, she\r\nbegan to run one hand down her arm and scrutinize the soft flow of\r\nmuscle under her skin. She thought of the marvellous beauty of skin,\r\nand all the delightfulness of living texture. Oh the back of her arm she\r\nfound the faintest down of hair in the world. \u201cEtherialized monkey,\u201d she\r\nsaid. She held out her arm straight before her, and turned her hand this\r\nway and that.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy should one pretend?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy should one pretend?\r\n\r\n\u201cThink of all the beauty in the world that is covered up and overlaid.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe glanced shyly at the mirror above her dressing-table, and then about\r\nher at the furniture, as though it might penetrate to the thoughts that\r\npeeped in her mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d said Ann Veronica at last, \u201cif I am beautiful? I wonder if I\r\nshall ever shine like a light, like a translucent goddess?--\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder--\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose girls and women have prayed for this, have come to this--In\r\nBabylon, in Nineveh.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t one face the facts of one\u2019s self?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stood up. She posed herself before her mirror and surveyed herself\r\nwith gravely thoughtful, gravely critical, and yet admiring eyes. \u201cAnd,\r\nafter all, I am just one common person!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe watched the throb of the arteries in the stem of her neck, and\r\nput her hand at last gently and almost timidly to where her heart beat\r\nbeneath her breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 9\r\n\r\n\r\nThe realization that she was in love flooded Ann Veronica\u2019s mind, and\r\naltered the quality of all its topics.\r\n\r\nShe began to think persistently of Capes, and it seemed to her now that\r\nfor some weeks at least she must have been thinking persistently of\r\nhim unawares. She was surprised to find how stored her mind was with\r\nimpressions and memories of him, how vividly she remembered his gestures\r\nand little things that he had said. It occurred to her that it was\r\nabsurd and wrong to be so continuously thinking of one engrossing topic,\r\nand she made a strenuous effort to force her mind to other questions.\r\n\r\nBut it was extraordinary what seemingly irrelevant things could restore\r\nher to the thought of Capes again. And when she went to sleep, then\r\nalways Capes became the novel and wonderful guest of her dreams.\r\n\r\nFor a time it really seemed all-sufficient to her that she should love.\r\nThat Capes should love her seemed beyond the compass of her imagination.\r\nIndeed, she did not want to think of him as loving her. She wanted to\r\nthink of him as her beloved person, to be near him and watch him,\r\nto have him going about, doing this and that, saying this and that,\r\nunconscious of her, while she too remained unconscious of herself. To\r\nthink of him as loving her would make all that different. Then he would\r\nturn his face to her, and she would have to think of herself in his\r\neyes. She would become defensive--what she did would be the thing that\r\nmattered. He would require things of her, and she would be passionately\r\nconcerned to meet his requirements. Loving was better than that. Loving\r\nwas self-forgetfulness, pure delighting in another human being. She felt\r\nthat with Capes near to her she would be content always to go on loving.\r\n\r\nShe went next day to the schools, and her world seemed all made of\r\nhappiness just worked up roughly into shapes and occasions and duties.\r\nShe found she could do her microscope work all the better for being in\r\nlove. She winced when first she heard the preparation-room door open and\r\nCapes came down the laboratory; but when at last he reached her she was\r\nself-possessed. She put a stool for him at a little distance from her\r\nown, and after he had seen the day\u2019s work he hesitated, and then plunged\r\ninto a resumption of their discussion about beauty.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think,\u201d he said, \u201cI was a little too mystical about beauty the other\r\nday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI like the mystical way,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur business here is the right way. I\u2019ve been thinking, you know--I\u2019m\r\nnot sure that primarily the perception of beauty isn\u2019t just intensity\r\nof feeling free from pain; intensity of perception without any tissue\r\ndestruction.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI like the mystical way better,\u201d said Ann Veronica, and thought.\r\n\r\n\u201cA number of beautiful things are not intense.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut delicacy, for example, may be intensely perceived.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why is one face beautiful and another not?\u201d objected Ann Veronica;\r\n\u201con your theory any two faces side by side in the sunlight ought to be\r\nequally beautiful. One must get them with exactly the same intensity.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe did not agree with that. \u201cI don\u2019t mean simply intensity of sensation.\r\nI said intensity of perception. You may perceive harmony, proportion,\r\nrhythm, intensely. They are things faint and slight in themselves, as\r\nphysical facts, but they are like the detonator of a bomb: they\r\nlet loose the explosive. There\u2019s the internal factor as well as the\r\nexternal.... I don\u2019t know if I express myself clearly. I mean that\r\nthe point is that vividness of perception is the essential factor of\r\nbeauty; but, of course, vividness may be created by a whisper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat brings us back,\u201d said Ann Veronica, \u201cto the mystery. Why should\r\nsome things and not others open the deeps?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that might, after all, be an outcome of selection--like the\r\npreference for blue flowers, which are not nearly so bright as yellow,\r\nof some insects.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t explain sunsets.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot quite so easily as it explains an insect alighting on colored\r\npaper. But perhaps if people didn\u2019t like clear, bright, healthy\r\neyes--which is biologically understandable--they couldn\u2019t like precious\r\nstones. One thing may be a necessary collateral of the others. And,\r\nafter all, a fine clear sky of bright colors is the signal to come out\r\nof hiding and rejoice and go on with life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m!\u201d said Ann Veronica, and shook her head.\r\n\r\nCapes smiled cheerfully with his eyes meeting hers. \u201cI throw it out\r\nin passing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I am after is that beauty isn\u2019t a special\r\ninserted sort of thing; that\u2019s my idea. It\u2019s just life, pure life, life\r\nnascent, running clear and strong.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stood up to go on to the next student.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s morbid beauty,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder if there is!\u201d said Capes, and paused, and then bent down over\r\nthe boy who wore his hair like Russell.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica surveyed his sloping back for a moment, and then drew her\r\nmicroscope toward her. Then for a time she sat very still. She felt that\r\nshe had passed a difficult corner, and that now she could go on talking\r\nwith him again, just as she had been used to do before she understood\r\nwhat was the matter with her....\r\n\r\nShe had one idea, she found, very clear in her mind--that she would get\r\na Research Scholarship, and so contrive another year in the laboratory.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow I see what everything means,\u201d said Ann Veronica to herself; and it\r\nreally felt for some days as though the secret of the universe, that had\r\nbeen wrapped and hidden from her so obstinately, was at last altogether\r\ndisplayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE NINTH\r\n\r\nDISCORDS\r\n\r\nPart 1\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, soon after Ann Veronica\u2019s great discovery, a telegram\r\ncame into the laboratory for her. It ran:\r\n\r\n     ---------------------------------------------------\r\n     |   Bored  |  and      | nothing  |   to   |   do   |\r\n     |----------|-----------|----------|--------|--------|\r\n     |   will   |    you    |   dine   |  with  |   me   |\r\n     |----------|-----------|----------|--------|--------|\r\n     | to-night | somewhere |   and    |  talk  |   I    |\r\n     |----------|-----------|----------|--------|--------|\r\n     |  shall   |     be    | grateful | Ramage |        |\r\n     ---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica was rather pleased by this. She had not seen Ramage for ten\r\nor eleven days, and she was quite ready for a gossip with him. And now\r\nher mind was so full of the thought that she was in love--in love!--that\r\nmarvellous state! that I really believe she had some dim idea of talking\r\nto him about it. At any rate, it would be good to hear him saying the\r\nsort of things he did--perhaps now she would grasp them better--with\r\nthis world-shaking secret brandishing itself about inside her head\r\nwithin a yard of him.\r\n\r\nShe was sorry to find Ramage a little disposed to be melancholy.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have made over seven hundred pounds in the last week,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s exhilarating,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d he said; \u201cit\u2019s only a score in a game.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a score you can buy all sorts of things with.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing that one wants.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe turned to the waiter, who held a wine-card. \u201cNothing can cheer me,\u201d\r\n he said, \u201cexcept champagne.\u201d He meditated. \u201cThis,\u201d he said, and then:\r\n\u201cNo! Is this sweeter? Very well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEverything goes well with me,\u201d he said, folding his arms under him and\r\nregarding Ann Veronica with the slightly projecting eyes wide open. \u201cAnd\r\nI\u2019m not happy. I believe I\u2019m in love.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe leaned back for his soup.\r\n\r\nPresently he resumed: \u201cI believe I must be in love.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be that,\u201d said Ann Veronica, wisely.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t exactly a depressing state, is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYOU don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne has theories,\u201d said Ann Veronica, radiantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, theories! Being in love is a fact.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt ought to make one happy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unrest--a longing--What\u2019s that?\u201d The waiter had intervened.\r\n\u201cParmesan--take it away!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe glanced at Ann Veronica\u2019s face, and it seemed to him that she really\r\nwas exceptionally radiant. He wondered why she thought love made people\r\nhappy, and began to talk of the smilax and pinks that adorned the table.\r\nHe filled her glass with champagne. \u201cYou MUST,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause of my\r\ndepression.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey were eating quails when they returned to the topic of love. \u201cWhat\r\nmade you think\u201d he said, abruptly, with the gleam of avidity in his\r\nface, \u201cthat love makes people happy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know it must.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was, she thought, a little too insistent. \u201cWomen know these things by\r\ninstinct,\u201d she answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d he said, \u201cif women do know things by instinct? I have\r\nmy doubts about feminine instinct. It\u2019s one of our conventional\r\nsuperstitions. A woman is supposed to know when a man is in love with\r\nher. Do you think she does?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica picked among her salad with a judicial expression of face.\r\n\u201cI think she would,\u201d she decided.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Ramage, impressively.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica looked up at him and found him regarding her with eyes that\r\nwere almost woebegone, and into which, indeed, he was trying to throw\r\nmuch more expression than they could carry. There was a little pause\r\nbetween them, full for Ann Veronica of rapid elusive suspicions and\r\nintimations.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps one talks nonsense about a woman\u2019s instinct,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s\r\na way of avoiding explanations. And girls and women, perhaps, are\r\ndifferent. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t suppose a girl can tell if a man is in\r\nlove with her or not in love with her.\u201d Her mind went off to Capes. Her\r\nthoughts took words for themselves. \u201cShe can\u2019t. I suppose it depends on\r\nher own state of mind. If one wants a thing very much, perhaps one is\r\ninclined to think one can\u2019t have it. I suppose if one were to love some\r\none, one would feel doubtful. And if one were to love some one very\r\nmuch, it\u2019s just so that one would be blindest, just when one wanted most\r\nto see.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stopped abruptly, afraid that Ramage might be able to infer Capes\r\nfrom the things she had said, and indeed his face was very eager.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica blushed. \u201cThat\u2019s all,\u201d she said \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m a little\r\nconfused about these things.\u201d\r\n\r\nRamage looked at her, and then fell into deep reflection as the waiter\r\ncame to paragraph their talk again.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you ever been to the opera, Ann Veronica?\u201d said Ramage.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce or twice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShall we go now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I would like to listen to music. What is there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTristan.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard Tristan and Isolde.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat settles it. We\u2019ll go. There\u2019s sure to be a place somewhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s rather jolly of you,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s jolly of you to come,\u201d said Ramage.\r\n\r\nSo presently they got into a hansom together, and Ann Veronica sat back\r\nfeeling very luxurious and pleasant, and looked at the light and stir\r\nand misty glitter of the street traffic from under slightly drooping\r\neyelids, while Ramage sat closer to her than he need have done, and\r\nglanced ever and again at her face, and made to speak and said nothing.\r\nAnd when they got to Covent Garden Ramage secured one of the little\r\nupper boxes, and they came into it as the overture began.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica took off her jacket and sat down in the corner chair, and\r\nleaned forward to look into the great hazy warm brown cavity of the\r\nhouse, and Ramage placed his chair to sit beside her and near her,\r\nfacing the stage. The music took hold of her slowly as her eyes wandered\r\nfrom the indistinct still ranks of the audience to the little busy\r\norchestra with its quivering violins, its methodical movements of brown\r\nand silver instruments, its brightly lit scores and shaded lights. She\r\nhad never been to the opera before except as one of a congested mass of\r\npeople in the cheaper seats, and with backs and heads and women\u2019s hats\r\nfor the frame of the spectacle; there was by contrast a fine large sense\r\nof space and ease in her present position. The curtain rose out of the\r\nconcluding bars of the overture and revealed Isolde on the prow of the\r\nbarbaric ship. The voice of the young seaman came floating down from the\r\nmasthead, and the story of the immortal lovers had begun. She knew\r\nthe story only imperfectly, and followed it now with a passionate and\r\ndeepening interest. The splendid voices sang on from phase to phase of\r\nlove\u2019s unfolding, the ship drove across the sea to the beating rhythm of\r\nthe rowers. The lovers broke into passionate knowledge of themselves and\r\neach other, and then, a jarring intervention, came King Mark amidst the\r\nshouts of the sailormen, and stood beside them.\r\n\r\nThe curtain came festooning slowly down, the music ceased, the lights\r\nin the auditorium glowed out, and Ann Veronica woke out of her confused\r\ndream of involuntary and commanding love in a glory of sound and colors\r\nto discover that Ramage was sitting close beside her with one hand\r\nresting lightly on her waist. She made a quick movement, and the hand\r\nfell away.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy God! Ann Veronica,\u201d he said, sighing deeply. \u201cThis stirs one.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe sat quite still looking at him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish you and I had drunk that love potion,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nShe found no ready reply to that, and he went on: \u201cThis music is the\r\nfood of love. It makes me desire life beyond measure. Life! Life and\r\nlove! It makes me want to be always young, always strong, always\r\ndevoting my life--and dying splendidly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very beautiful,\u201d said Ann Veronica in a low tone.\r\n\r\nThey said no more for a moment, and each was now acutely aware of the\r\nother. Ann Veronica was excited and puzzled, with a sense of a strange\r\nand disconcerting new light breaking over her relations with Ramage.\r\nShe had never thought of him at all in that way before. It did not shock\r\nher; it amazed her, interested her beyond measure. But also this must\r\nnot go on. She felt he was going to say something more--something\r\nstill more personal and intimate. She was curious, and at the same time\r\nclearly resolved she must not hear it. She felt she must get him talking\r\nupon some impersonal theme at any cost. She snatched about in her mind.\r\n\u201cWhat is the exact force of a motif?\u201d she asked at random. \u201cBefore I\r\nheard much Wagnerian music I heard enthusiastic descriptions of it from\r\na mistress I didn\u2019t like at school. She gave me an impression of a sort\r\nof patched quilt; little bits of patterned stuff coming up again and\r\nagain.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stopped with an air of interrogation.\r\n\r\nRamage looked at her for a long and discriminating interval without\r\nspeaking. He seemed to be hesitating between two courses of action. \u201cI\r\ndon\u2019t know much about the technique of music,\u201d he said at last, with his\r\neyes upon her. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of feeling with me.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe contradicted himself by plunging into an exposition of motifs.\r\n\r\nBy a tacit agreement they ignored the significant thing between them,\r\nignored the slipping away of the ground on which they had stood together\r\nhitherto....\r\n\r\nAll through the love music of the second act, until the hunting horns of\r\nMark break in upon the dream, Ann Veronica\u2019s consciousness was flooded\r\nwith the perception of a man close beside her, preparing some new thing\r\nto say to her, preparing, perhaps, to touch her, stretching hungry\r\ninvisible tentacles about her. She tried to think what she should do in\r\nthis eventuality or that. Her mind had been and was full of the thought\r\nof Capes, a huge generalized Capes-lover. And in some incomprehensible\r\nway, Ramage was confused with Capes; she had a grotesque disposition to\r\npersuade herself that this was really Capes who surrounded her, as it\r\nwere, with wings of desire. The fact that it was her trusted friend\r\nmaking illicit love to her remained, in spite of all her effort, an\r\ninsignificant thing in her mind. The music confused and distracted her,\r\nand made her struggle against a feeling of intoxication. Her head swam.\r\nThat was the inconvenience of it; her head was swimming. The music\r\nthrobbed into the warnings that preceded the king\u2019s irruption.\r\n\r\nAbruptly he gripped her wrist. \u201cI love you, Ann Veronica. I love\r\nyou--with all my heart and soul.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe put her face closer to his. She felt the warm nearness of his.\r\n\u201cDON\u2019T!\u201d she said, and wrenched her wrist from his retaining hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God! Ann Veronica,\u201d he said, struggling to keep his hold upon her;\r\n\u201cmy God! Tell me--tell me now--tell me you love me!\u201d\r\n\r\nHis expression was as it were rapaciously furtive. She answered in\r\nwhispers, for there was the white arm of a woman in the next box peeping\r\nbeyond the partition within a yard of him.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy hand! This isn\u2019t the place.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe released her hand and talked in eager undertones against an auditory\r\nbackground of urgency and distress.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnn Veronica,\u201d he said, \u201cI tell you this is love. I love the soles of\r\nyour feet. I love your very breath. I have tried not to tell you--tried\r\nto be simply your friend. It is no good. I want you. I worship you. I\r\nwould do anything--I would give anything to make you mine.... Do you\r\nhear me? Do you hear what I am saying?... Love!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe held her arm and abandoned it again at her quick defensive movement.\r\nFor a long time neither spoke again.\r\n\r\nShe sat drawn together in her chair in the corner of the box, at a loss\r\nwhat to say or do--afraid, curious, perplexed. It seemed to her that\r\nit was her duty to get up and clamor to go home to her room, to protest\r\nagainst his advances as an insult. But she did not in the least want\r\nto do that. These sweeping dignities were not within the compass of her\r\nwill; she remembered she liked Ramage, and owed things to him, and she\r\nwas interested--she was profoundly interested. He was in love with\r\nher! She tried to grasp all the welter of values in the situation\r\nsimultaneously, and draw some conclusion from their disorder.\r\n\r\nHe began to talk again in quick undertones that she could not clearly\r\nhear.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have loved you,\u201d he was saying, \u201cever since you sat on that gate and\r\ntalked. I have always loved you. I don\u2019t care what divides us. I don\u2019t\r\ncare what else there is in the world. I want you beyond measure or\r\nreckoning....\u201d\r\n\r\nHis voice rose and fell amidst the music and the singing of Tristan and\r\nKing Mark, like a voice heard in a badly connected telephone. She stared\r\nat his pleading face.\r\n\r\nShe turned to the stage, and Tristan was wounded in Kurvenal\u2019s arms,\r\nwith Isolde at his feet, and King Mark, the incarnation of masculine\r\nforce and obligation, the masculine creditor of love and beauty, stood\r\nover him, and the second climax was ending in wreaths and reek of\r\nmelodies; and then the curtain was coming down in a series of short\r\nrushes, the music had ended, and the people were stirring and breaking\r\nout into applause, and the lights of the auditorium were resuming. The\r\nlighting-up pierced the obscurity of the box, and Ramage stopped his\r\nurgent flow of words abruptly and sat back. This helped to restore Ann\r\nVeronica\u2019s self-command.\r\n\r\nShe turned her eyes to him again, and saw her late friend and pleasant\r\nand trusted companion, who had seen fit suddenly to change into a lover,\r\nbabbling interesting inacceptable things. He looked eager and flushed\r\nand troubled. His eyes caught at hers with passionate inquiries. \u201cTell\r\nme,\u201d he said; \u201cspeak to me.\u201d She realized it was possible to be sorry\r\nfor him--acutely sorry for the situation. Of course this thing was\r\nabsolutely impossible. But she was disturbed, mysteriously disturbed.\r\nShe remembered abruptly that she was really living upon his money. She\r\nleaned forward and addressed him.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Ramage,\u201d she said, \u201cplease don\u2019t talk like this.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe made to speak and did not.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to do it, to go on talking to me. I don\u2019t want to hear\r\nyou. If I had known that you had meant to talk like this I wouldn\u2019t have\r\ncome here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how can I help it? How can I keep silence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease!\u201d she insisted. \u201cPlease not now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI MUST talk with you. I must say what I have to say!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut not now--not here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt came,\u201d he said. \u201cI never planned it--And now I have begun--\u201d\r\n\r\nShe felt acutely that he was entitled to explanations, and as acutely\r\nthat explanations were impossible that night. She wanted to think.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Ramage,\u201d she said, \u201cI can\u2019t--Not now. Will you please--Not now, or\r\nI must go.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stared at her, trying to guess at the mystery of her thoughts.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. But I must--I ought--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI MUST talk about this. Indeed I must.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I love you. I love you--unendurably.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen don\u2019t talk to me now. I don\u2019t want you to talk to me now. There is\r\na place--This isn\u2019t the place. You have misunderstood. I can\u2019t explain--\u201d\r\n\r\nThey regarded one another, each blinded to the other. \u201cForgive me,\u201d he\r\ndecided to say at last, and his voice had a little quiver of emotion,\r\nand he laid his hand on hers upon her knee. \u201cI am the most foolish of\r\nmen. I was stupid--stupid and impulsive beyond measure to burst upon\r\nyou in this way. I--I am a love-sick idiot, and not accountable for my\r\nactions. Will you forgive me--if I say no more?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with perplexed, earnest eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cPretend,\u201d he said, \u201cthat all I have said hasn\u2019t been said. And let us\r\ngo on with our evening. Why not? Imagine I\u2019ve had a fit of hysteria--and\r\nthat I\u2019ve come round.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, and abruptly she liked him enormously. She felt this\r\nwas the sensible way out of this oddly sinister situation.\r\n\r\nHe still watched her and questioned her.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd let us have a talk about this--some other time. Somewhere, where we\r\ncan talk without interruption. Will you?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe thought, and it seemed to him she had never looked so\r\nself-disciplined and deliberate and beautiful. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cthat\r\nis what we ought to do.\u201d But now she doubted again of the quality of the\r\narmistice they had just made.\r\n\r\nHe had a wild impulse to shout. \u201cAgreed,\u201d he said with queer exaltation,\r\nand his grip tightened on her hand. \u201cAnd to-night we are friends?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are friends,\u201d said Ann Veronica, and drew her hand quickly away from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-night we are as we have always been. Except that this music we have\r\nbeen swimming in is divine. While I have been pestering you, have you\r\nheard it? At least, you heard the first act. And all the third act is\r\nlove-sick music. Tristan dying and Isolde coming to crown his death.\r\nWagner had just been in love when he wrote it all. It begins with that\r\nqueer piccolo solo. Now I shall never hear it but what this evening will\r\ncome pouring back over me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe lights sank, the prelude to the third act was beginning, the\r\nmusic rose and fell in crowded intimations of lovers separated--lovers\r\nseparated with scars and memories between them, and the curtain went\r\nreefing up to display Tristan lying wounded on his couch and the\r\nshepherd crouching with his pipe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\n\r\nThey had their explanations the next evening, but they were explanations\r\nin quite other terms than Ann Veronica had anticipated, quite other and\r\nmuch more startling and illuminating terms. Ramage came for her at her\r\nlodgings, and she met him graciously and kindly as a queen who knows she\r\nmust needs give sorrow to a faithful liege. She was unusually soft\r\nand gentle in her manner to him. He was wearing a new silk hat, with a\r\nslightly more generous brim than its predecessor, and it suited his type\r\nof face, robbed his dark eyes a little of their aggressiveness and gave\r\nhim a solid and dignified and benevolent air. A faint anticipation of\r\ntriumph showed in his manner and a subdued excitement.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go to a place where we can have a private room,\u201d he said.\r\n\u201cThen--then we can talk things out.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo they went this time to the Rococo, in Germain Street, and up-stairs\r\nto a landing upon which stood a bald-headed waiter with whiskers like a\r\nFrench admiral and discretion beyond all limits in his manner. He seemed\r\nto have expected them. He ushered them with an amiable flat hand into a\r\nminute apartment with a little gas-stove, a silk crimson-covered sofa,\r\nand a bright little table, gay with napery and hot-house flowers.\r\n\r\n\u201cOdd little room,\u201d said Ann Veronica, dimly apprehending that obtrusive\r\nsofa.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne can talk without undertones, so to speak,\u201d said Ramage.\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s--private.\u201d He stood looking at the preparations before them with\r\nan unusual preoccupation of manner, then roused himself to take her\r\njacket, a little awkwardly, and hand it to the waiter who hung it in the\r\ncorner of the room. It appeared he had already ordered dinner and\r\nwine, and the whiskered waiter waved in his subordinate with the soup\r\nforthwith.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to talk of indifferent themes,\u201d said Ramage, a little\r\nfussily, \u201cuntil these interruptions of the service are over. Then--then\r\nwe shall be together.... How did you like Tristan?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica paused the fraction of a second before her reply came.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought much of it amazingly beautiful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it. And to think that man got it all out of the poorest little\r\nlove-story for a respectable titled lady! Have you read of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt gives in a nutshell the miracle of art and the imagination. You get\r\nthis queer irascible musician quite impossibly and unfortunately in\r\nlove with a wealthy patroness, and then out of his brain comes THIS, a\r\ntapestry of glorious music, setting out love to lovers, lovers who love\r\nin spite of all that is wise and respectable and right.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica thought. She did not want to seem to shrink from\r\nconversation, but all sorts of odd questions were running through her\r\nmind. \u201cI wonder why people in love are so defiant, so careless of other\r\nconsiderations?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe very hares grow brave. I suppose because it IS the chief thing in\r\nlife.\u201d He stopped and said earnestly: \u201cIt is the chief thing in\r\nlife, and everything else goes down before it. Everything, my dear,\r\neverything!... But we have got to talk upon indifferent themes until\r\nwe have done with this blond young gentleman from Bavaria....\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dinner came to an end at last, and the whiskered waiter presented\r\nhis bill and evacuated the apartment and closed the door behind him with\r\nan almost ostentatious discretion. Ramage stood up, and suddenly turned\r\nthe key in the door in an off-hand manner. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cno one can\r\nblunder in upon us. We are alone and we can say and do what we please.\r\nWe two.\u201d He stood still, looking at her.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica tried to seem absolutely unconcerned. The turning of the\r\nkey startled her, but she did not see how she could make an objection.\r\nShe felt she had stepped into a world of unknown usages.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have waited for this,\u201d he said, and stood quite still, looking at her\r\nuntil the silence became oppressive.\r\n\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t you sit down,\u201d she said, \u201cand tell me what you want to say?\u201d Her\r\nvoice was flat and faint. Suddenly she had become afraid. She struggled\r\nnot to be afraid. After all, what could happen?\r\n\r\nHe was looking at her very hard and earnestly. \u201cAnn Veronica,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nThen before she could say a word to arrest him he was at her side.\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d she said, weakly, as he had bent down and put one arm about her\r\nand seized her hands with his disengaged hand and kissed her--kissed her\r\nalmost upon her lips. He seemed to do ten things before she could think\r\nto do one, to leap upon her and take possession.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica\u2019s universe, which had never been altogether so respectful\r\nto her as she could have wished, gave a shout and whirled head over\r\nheels. Everything in the world had changed for her. If hate could kill,\r\nRamage would have been killed by a flash of hate. \u201cMr. Ramage!\u201d she\r\ncried, and struggled to her feet.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy darling!\u201d he said, clasping her resolutely in his arms, \u201cmy\r\ndearest!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Ramage!\u201d she began, and his mouth sealed hers and his breath was\r\nmixed with her breath. Her eye met his four inches away, and his was\r\nglaring, immense, and full of resolution, a stupendous monster of an\r\neye.\r\n\r\nShe shut her lips hard, her jaw hardened, and she set herself to\r\nstruggle with him. She wrenched her head away from his grip and got her\r\narm between his chest and hers. They began to wrestle fiercely. Each\r\nbecame frightfully aware of the other as a plastic energetic body,\r\nof the strong muscles of neck against cheek, of hands gripping\r\nshoulder-blade and waist. \u201cHow dare you!\u201d she panted, with her world\r\nscreaming and grimacing insult at her. \u201cHow dare you!\u201d\r\n\r\nThey were both astonished at the other\u2019s strength. Perhaps Ramage was\r\nthe more astonished. Ann Veronica had been an ardent hockey player and\r\nhad had a course of jiu-jitsu in the High School. Her defence ceased\r\nrapidly to be in any sense ladylike, and became vigorous and effective;\r\na strand of black hair that had escaped its hairpins came athwart\r\nRamage\u2019s eyes, and then the knuckles of a small but very hardly clinched\r\nfist had thrust itself with extreme effectiveness and painfulness under\r\nhis jawbone and ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet go!\u201d said Ann Veronica, through her teeth, strenuously inflicting\r\nagony, and he cried out sharply and let go and receded a pace.\r\n\r\n\u201cNOW!\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cWhy did you dare to do that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3\r\n\r\n\r\nEach of them stared at the other, set in a universe that had changed its\r\nsystem of values with kaleidoscopic completeness. She was flushed, and\r\nher eyes were bright and angry; her breath came sobbing, and her hair\r\nwas all abroad in wandering strands of black. He too was flushed and\r\nruffled; one side of his collar had slipped from its stud and he held a\r\nhand to the corner of his jaw.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou vixen!\u201d said Mr. Ramage, speaking the simplest first thought of his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou had no right--\u201d panted Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy on earth,\u201d he asked, \u201cdid you hurt me like that?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica did her best to think she had not deliberately attempted to\r\ncause him pain. She ignored his question.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never dreamt!\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat on earth did you expect me to do, then?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 4\r\n\r\n\r\nInterpretation came pouring down upon her almost blindingly; she\r\nunderstood now the room, the waiter, the whole situation. She\r\nunderstood. She leaped to a world of shabby knowledge, of furtive base\r\nrealizations. She wanted to cry out upon herself for the uttermost fool\r\nin existence.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you wanted to have a talk to me,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wanted to make love to you.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou knew it,\u201d he added, in her momentary silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou said you were in love with me,\u201d said Ann Veronica; \u201cI wanted to\r\nexplain--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI said I loved and wanted you.\u201d The brutality of his first astonishment\r\nwas evaporating. \u201cI am in love with you. You know I am in love with you.\r\nAnd then you go--and half throttle me.... I believe you\u2019ve crushed a\r\ngland or something. It feels like it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cWhat else was I to do?\u201d\r\n\r\nFor some seconds she stood watching him and both were thinking very\r\nquickly. Her state of mind would have seemed altogether discreditable to\r\nher grandmother. She ought to have been disposed to faint and scream at\r\nall these happenings; she ought to have maintained a front of outraged\r\ndignity to veil the sinking of her heart. I would like to have to tell\r\nit so. But indeed that is not at all a good description of her attitude.\r\nShe was an indignant queen, no doubt she was alarmed and disgusted\r\nwithin limits; but she was highly excited, and there was something, some\r\nlow adventurous strain in her being, some element, subtle at least if\r\nbase, going about the rioting ways and crowded insurgent meeting-places\r\nof her mind declaring that the whole affair was after all--they are the\r\nonly words that express it--a very great lark indeed. At the bottom\r\nof her heart she was not a bit afraid of Ramage. She had unaccountable\r\ngleams of sympathy with and liking for him. And the grotesquest fact\r\nwas that she did not so much loathe, as experience with a quite critical\r\ncondemnation this strange sensation of being kissed. Never before had\r\nany human being kissed her lips....\r\n\r\nIt was only some hours after that these ambiguous elements evaporated\r\nand vanished and loathing came, and she really began to be thoroughly\r\nsick and ashamed of the whole disgraceful quarrel and scuffle.\r\n\r\nHe, for his part, was trying to grasp the series of unexpected reactions\r\nthat had so wrecked their tete-a-tete. He had meant to be master of his\r\nfate that evening and it had escaped him altogether. It had, as it were,\r\nblown up at the concussion of his first step. It dawned upon him that he\r\nhad been abominably used by Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here,\u201d he said, \u201cI brought you here to make love to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t understand--your idea of making love. You had better let me go\r\nagain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said. \u201cI do love you. I love you all the more for the\r\nstreak of sheer devil in you.... You are the most beautiful, the most\r\ndesirable thing I have ever met in this world. It was good to kiss you,\r\neven at the price. But, by Jove! you are fierce! You are like those\r\nRoman women who carry stilettos in their hair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI came here to talk reasonably, Mr. Ramage. It is abominable--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the use of keeping up this note of indignation, Ann Veronica?\r\nHere I am! I am your lover, burning for you. I mean to have you! Don\u2019t\r\nfrown me off now. Don\u2019t go back into Victorian respectability and\r\npretend you don\u2019t know and you can\u2019t think and all the rest of it. One\r\ncomes at last to the step from dreams to reality. This is your moment.\r\nNo one will ever love you as I love you now. I have been dreaming of\r\nyour body and you night after night. I have been imaging--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Ramage, I came here--I didn\u2019t suppose for one moment you would\r\ndare--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNonsense! That is your mistake! You are too intellectual. You want to\r\ndo everything with your mind. You are afraid of kisses. You are afraid\r\nof the warmth in your blood. It\u2019s just because all that side of your\r\nlife hasn\u2019t fairly begun.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe made a step toward her.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Ramage,\u201d she said, sharply, \u201cI have to make it plain to you. I\r\ndon\u2019t think you understand. I don\u2019t love you. I don\u2019t. I can\u2019t love you.\r\nI love some one else. It is repulsive. It disgusts me that you should\r\ntouch me.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stared in amazement at this new aspect of the situation. \u201cYou love\r\nsome one else?\u201d he repeated.\r\n\r\n\u201cI love some one else. I could not dream of loving you.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd then he flashed his whole conception of the relations of men and\r\nwomen upon her in one astonishing question. His hand went with an almost\r\ninstinctive inquiry to his jawbone again. \u201cThen why the devil,\u201d he\r\ndemanded, \u201cdo you let me stand you dinners and the opera--and why do you\r\ncome to a cabinet particuliar with me?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe became radiant with anger. \u201cYou mean to tell me\u201d he said, \u201cthat you\r\nhave a lover? While I have been keeping you! Yes--keeping you!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis view of life he hurled at her as if it were an offensive missile.\r\nIt stunned her. She felt she must fly before it and could no longer do\r\nso. She did not think for one moment what interpretation he might put\r\nupon the word \u201clover.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Ramage,\u201d she said, clinging to her one point, \u201cI want to get out of\r\nthis horrible little room. It has all been a mistake. I have been stupid\r\nand foolish. Will you unlock that door?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever!\u201d he said. \u201cConfound your lover! Look here! Do you really think\r\nI am going to run you while he makes love to you? No fear! I never heard\r\nof anything so cool. If he wants you, let him get you. You\u2019re mine. I\u2019ve\r\npaid for you and helped you, and I\u2019m going to conquer you somehow--if\r\nI have to break you to do it. Hitherto you\u2019ve seen only my easy, kindly\r\nside. But now confound it! how can you prevent it? I will kiss you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t!\u201d said Ann Veronica; with the clearest note of determination.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be about to move toward her. She stepped back quickly, and\r\nher hand knocked a wine-glass from the table to smash noisily on the\r\nfloor. She caught at the idea. \u201cIf you come a step nearer to me,\u201d she\r\nsaid, \u201cI will smash every glass on this table.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, by God!\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019ll be locked up!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica was disconcerted for a moment. She had a vision of\r\npolicemen, reproving magistrates, a crowded court, public disgrace. She\r\nsaw her aunt in tears, her father white-faced and hard hit. \u201cDon\u2019t come\r\nnearer!\u201d she said.\r\n\r\nThere was a discreet knocking at the door, and Ramage\u2019s face changed.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, under her breath, \u201cyou can\u2019t face it.\u201d And she knew that\r\nshe was safe.\r\n\r\nHe went to the door. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said, reassuringly to the\r\ninquirer without.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica glanced at the mirror to discover a flushed and dishevelled\r\ndisorder. She began at once a hasty readjustment of her hair, while\r\nRamage parleyed with inaudible interrogations. \u201cA glass slipped from the\r\ntable,\u201d he explained.... \u201cNon. Fas du tout. Non.... Niente.... Bitte!...\r\nOui, dans la note.... Presently. Presently.\u201d That conversation ended and\r\nhe turned to her again.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am going,\u201d she said grimly, with three hairpins in her mouth.\r\n\r\nShe took her hat from the peg in the corner and began to put it on. He\r\nregarded that perennial miracle of pinning with wrathful eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, Ann Veronica,\u201d he began. \u201cI want a plain word with you about\r\nall this. Do you mean to tell me you didn\u2019t understand why I wanted you\r\nto come here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d said Ann Veronica stoutly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t expect that I should kiss you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow was I to know that a man would--would think it was possible--when\r\nthere was nothing--no love?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did I know there wasn\u2019t love?\u201d\r\n\r\nThat silenced her for a moment. \u201cAnd what on earth,\u201d he said, \u201cdo you\r\nthink the world is made of? Why do you think I have been doing things\r\nfor you? The abstract pleasure of goodness? Are you one of the members\r\nof that great white sisterhood that takes and does not give? The good\r\naccepting woman! Do you really suppose a girl is entitled to live at\r\nfree quarters on any man she meets without giving any return?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought,\u201d said Ann Veronica, \u201cyou were my friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFriend! What have a man and a girl in common to make them friends? Ask\r\nthat lover of yours! And even with friends, would you have it all Give\r\non one side and all Take on the other?... Does HE know I keep you?...\r\nYou won\u2019t have a man\u2019s lips near you, but you\u2019ll eat out of his hand\r\nfast enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica was stung to helpless anger.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Ramage,\u201d she cried, \u201cyou are outrageous! You understand nothing.\r\nYou are--horrible. Will you let me go out of this room?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d cried Ramage; \u201chear me out! I\u2019ll have that satisfaction, anyhow.\r\nYou women, with your tricks of evasion, you\u2019re a sex of swindlers.\r\nYou have all the instinctive dexterity of parasites. You make yourself\r\ncharming for help. You climb by disappointing men. This lover of\r\nyours--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know!\u201d cried Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica could have wept with vexation. Indeed, a note of weeping\r\nbroke her voice for a moment as she burst out, \u201cYou know as well as I do\r\nthat money was a loan!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLoan!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou yourself called it a loan!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEuphuism. We both understood that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shall have every penny of it back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll frame it--when I get it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll pay you if I have to work at shirt-making at threepence an hour.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never pay me. You think you will. It\u2019s your way of glossing over\r\nthe ethical position. It\u2019s the sort of way a woman always does gloss\r\nover her ethical positions. You\u2019re all dependents--all of you. By\r\ninstinct. Only you good ones--shirk. You shirk a straightforward and\r\ndecent return for what you get from us--taking refuge in purity and\r\ndelicacy and such-like when it comes to payment.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Ramage,\u201d said Ann Veronica, \u201cI want to go--NOW!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 5\r\n\r\n\r\nBut she did not get away just then.\r\n\r\nRamage\u2019s bitterness passed as abruptly as his aggression. \u201cOh,\r\nAnn Veronica!\u201d he cried, \u201cI cannot let you go like this! You don\u2019t\r\nunderstand. You can\u2019t possibly understand!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe began a confused explanation, a perplexing contradictory apology for\r\nhis urgency and wrath. He loved Ann Veronica, he said; he was so mad\r\nto have her that he defeated himself, and did crude and alarming and\r\nsenseless things. His vicious abusiveness vanished. He suddenly became\r\neloquent and plausible. He did make her perceive something of the acute,\r\ntormenting desire for her that had arisen in him and possessed him.\r\nShe stood, as it were, directed doorward, with her eyes watching every\r\nmovement, listening to him, repelled by him and yet dimly understanding.\r\n\r\nAt any rate he made it very clear that night that there was an\r\nineradicable discord in life, a jarring something that must shatter all\r\nher dreams of a way of living for women that would enable them to be\r\nfree and spacious and friendly with men, and that was the passionate\r\npredisposition of men to believe that the love of women can be earned\r\nand won and controlled and compelled.\r\n\r\nHe flung aside all his talk of help and disinterested friendship as\r\nthough it had never been even a disguise between them, as though\r\nfrom the first it was no more than a fancy dress they had put quite\r\nunderstandingly upon their relationship. He had set out to win her, and\r\nshe had let him start. And at the thought of that other lover--he was\r\nconvinced that that beloved person was a lover, and she found herself\r\nunable to say a word to explain to him that this other person, the\r\nperson she loved, did not even know of her love--Ramage grew angry\r\nand savage once more, and returned suddenly to gibe and insult. Men do\r\nservices for the love of women, and the woman who takes must pay. Such\r\nwas the simple code that displayed itself in all his thoughts. He left\r\nthat arid rule clear of the least mist of refinement or delicacy.\r\n\r\nThat he should pay forty pounds to help this girl who preferred another\r\nman was no less in his eyes than a fraud and mockery that made her\r\ndenial a maddening and outrageous disgrace to him. And this though he\r\nwas evidently passionately in love with her.\r\n\r\nFor a while he threatened her. \u201cYou have put all your life in my hands,\u201d\r\n he declared. \u201cThink of that check you endorsed. There it is--against\r\nyou. I defy you to explain it away. What do you think people will make\r\nof that? What will this lover of yours make of that?\u201d\r\n\r\nAt intervals Ann Veronica demanded to go, declaring her undying resolve\r\nto repay him at any cost, and made short movements doorward.\r\n\r\nBut at last this ordeal was over, and Ramage opened the door. She\r\nemerged with a white face and wide-open eyes upon a little, red-lit\r\nlanding. She went past three keenly observant and ostentatiously\r\npreoccupied waiters down the thick-carpeted staircase and out of the\r\nHotel Rococo, that remarkable laboratory of relationships, past a tall\r\nporter in blue and crimson, into a cool, clear night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 6\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Ann Veronica reached her little bed-sitting-room again, every nerve\r\nin her body was quivering with shame and self-disgust.\r\n\r\nShe threw hat and coat on the bed and sat down before the fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d she said, splintering the surviving piece of coal into\r\nindignant flame-spurting fragments with one dexterous blow, \u201cwhat am I\r\nto do?\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in a hole!--mess is a better word, expresses it better. I\u2019m in a\r\nmess--a nasty mess! a filthy mess! Oh, no end of a mess!\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you hear, Ann Veronica?--you\u2019re in a nasty, filthy, unforgivable\r\nmess!\r\n\r\n\u201cHaven\u2019t I just made a silly mess of things?\r\n\r\n\u201cForty pounds! I haven\u2019t got twenty!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe got up, stamped with her foot, and then, suddenly remembering the\r\nlodger below, sat down and wrenched off her boots.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is what comes of being a young woman up to date. By Jove! I\u2019m\r\nbeginning to have my doubts about freedom!\r\n\r\n\u201cYou silly young woman, Ann Veronica! You silly young woman! The\r\nsmeariness of the thing!\r\n\r\n\u201cThe smeariness of this sort of thing!... Mauled about!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe fell to rubbing her insulted lips savagely with the back of her\r\nhand. \u201cUgh!\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe young women of Jane Austen\u2019s time didn\u2019t get into this sort of\r\nscrape! At least--one thinks so.... I wonder if some of them did--and\r\nit didn\u2019t get reported. Aunt Jane had her quiet moments. Most of\r\nthem didn\u2019t, anyhow. They were properly brought up, and sat still and\r\nstraight, and took the luck fate brought them as gentlewomen should.\r\nAnd they had an idea of what men were like behind all their nicety. They\r\nknew they were all Bogey in disguise. I didn\u2019t! I didn\u2019t! After all--\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a time her mind ran on daintiness and its defensive restraints\r\nas though it was the one desirable thing. That world of fine printed\r\ncambrics and escorted maidens, of delicate secondary meanings and\r\nrefined allusiveness, presented itself to her imagination with the\r\nbrightness of a lost paradise, as indeed for many women it is a lost\r\nparadise.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder if there is anything wrong with my manners,\u201d she said. \u201cI\r\nwonder if I\u2019ve been properly brought up. If I had been quite quiet and\r\nwhite and dignified, wouldn\u2019t it have been different? Would he have\r\ndared?...\u201d\r\n\r\nFor some creditable moments in her life Ann Veronica was utterly\r\ndisgusted with herself; she was wrung with a passionate and belated\r\ndesire to move gently, to speak softly and ambiguously--to be, in\r\neffect, prim.\r\n\r\nHorrible details recurred to her.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, among other things, did I put my knuckles in his\r\nneck--deliberately to hurt him?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe tried to sound the humorous note.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you aware, Ann Veronica, you nearly throttled that gentleman?\u201d\r\n\r\nThen she reviled her own foolish way of putting it.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou ass and imbecile, Ann Veronica! You female cad! Cad! Cad!... Why\r\naren\u2019t you folded up clean in lavender--as every young woman ought to\r\nbe? What have you been doing with yourself?...\u201d\r\n\r\nShe raked into the fire with the poker.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll of which doesn\u2019t help me in the slightest degree to pay back that\r\nmoney.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat night was the most intolerable one that Ann Veronica had ever\r\nspent. She washed her face with unwonted elaboration before she went\r\nto bed. This time, there was no doubt, she did not sleep. The more\r\nshe disentangled the lines of her situation the deeper grew her\r\nself-disgust. Occasionally the mere fact of lying in bed became\r\nunendurable, and she rolled out and marched about her room and whispered\r\nabuse of herself--usually until she hit against some article of\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\nThen she would have quiet times, in which she would say to herself, \u201cNow\r\nlook here! Let me think it all out!\u201d\r\n\r\nFor the first time, it seemed to her, she faced the facts of a woman\u2019s\r\nposition in the world--the meagre realities of such freedom as it\r\npermitted her, the almost unavoidable obligation to some individual man\r\nunder which she must labor for even a foothold in the world. She had\r\nflung away from her father\u2019s support with the finest assumption of\r\npersonal independence. And here she was--in a mess because it had\r\nbeen impossible for her to avoid leaning upon another man. She had\r\nthought--What had she thought? That this dependence of women was but\r\nan illusion which needed only to be denied to vanish. She had denied it\r\nwith vigor, and here she was!\r\n\r\nShe did not so much exhaust this general question as pass from it to her\r\ninsoluble individual problem again: \u201cWhat am I to do?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe wanted first of all to fling the forty pounds back into Ramage\u2019s\r\nface. But she had spent nearly half of it, and had no conception of how\r\nsuch a sum could be made good again. She thought of all sorts of odd and\r\ndesperate expedients, and with passionate petulance rejected them all.\r\n\r\nShe took refuge in beating her pillow and inventing insulting epithets\r\nfor herself. She got up, drew up her blind, and stared out of window at\r\na dawn-cold vision of chimneys for a time, and then went and sat on the\r\nedge of her bed. What was the alternative to going home? No alternative\r\nappeared in that darkness.\r\n\r\nIt seemed intolerable that she should go home and admit herself beaten.\r\nShe did most urgently desire to save her face in Morningside Park, and\r\nfor long hours she could think of no way of putting it that would not be\r\nin the nature of unconditional admission of defeat.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather go as a chorus-girl,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\nShe was not very clear about the position and duties of a chorus-girl,\r\nbut it certainly had the air of being a last desperate resort.\r\nThere sprang from that a vague hope that perhaps she might extort a\r\ncapitulation from her father by a threat to seek that position, and then\r\nwith overwhelming clearness it came to her that whatever happened she\r\nwould never be able to tell her father about her debt. The completest\r\ncapitulation would not wipe out that trouble. And she felt that if she\r\nwent home it was imperative to pay. She would always be going to and fro\r\nup the Avenue, getting glimpses of Ramage, seeing him in trains....\r\n\r\nFor a time she promenaded the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did I ever take that loan? An idiot girl in an asylum would have\r\nknown better than that!\r\n\r\n\u201cVulgarity of soul and innocence of mind--the worst of all conceivable\r\ncombinations. I wish some one would kill Ramage by accident!...\r\n\r\n\u201cBut then they would find that check endorsed in his bureau....\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder what he will do?\u201d She tried to imagine situations that might\r\narise out of Ramage\u2019s antagonism, for he had been so bitter and savage\r\nthat she could not believe that he would leave things as they were.\r\n\r\nThe next morning she went out with her post-office savings bank-book,\r\nand telegraphed for a warrant to draw out all the money she had in the\r\nworld. It amounted to two-and-twenty pounds. She addressed an envelope\r\nto Ramage, and scrawled on a half-sheet of paper, \u201cThe rest shall\r\nfollow.\u201d The money would be available in the afternoon, and she would\r\nsend him four five-pound notes. The rest she meant to keep for\r\nher immediate necessities. A little relieved by this step toward\r\nreinstatement, she went on to the Imperial College to forget her muddle\r\nof problems for a time, if she could, in the presence of Capes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 7\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a time the biological laboratory was full of healing virtue. Her\r\nsleepless night had left her languid but not stupefied, and for an hour\r\nor so the work distracted her altogether from her troubles.\r\n\r\nThen, after Capes had been through her work and had gone on, it came to\r\nher that the fabric of this life of hers was doomed to almost immediate\r\ncollapse; that in a little while these studies would cease, and perhaps\r\nshe would never set eyes on him again. After that consolations fled.\r\n\r\nThe overnight nervous strain began to tell; she became inattentive\r\nto the work before her, and it did not get on. She felt sleepy and\r\nunusually irritable. She lunched at a creamery in Great Portland Street,\r\nand as the day was full of wintry sunshine, spent the rest of the\r\nlunch-hour in a drowsy gloom, which she imagined to be thought upon the\r\nproblems of her position, on a seat in Regent\u2019s Park. A girl of fifteen\r\nor sixteen gave her a handbill that she regarded as a tract until she\r\nsaw \u201cVotes for Women\u201d at the top. That turned her mind to the more\r\ngeneralized aspects of her perplexities again. She had never been so\r\ndisposed to agree that the position of women in the modern world is\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\nCapes joined the students at tea, and displayed himself in an impish\r\nmood that sometimes possessed him. He did not notice that Ann Veronica\r\nwas preoccupied and heavy-eyed. Miss Klegg raised the question of\r\nwomen\u2019s suffrage, and he set himself to provoke a duel between her and\r\nMiss Garvice. The youth with the hair brushed back and the spectacled\r\nScotchman joined in the fray for and against the women\u2019s vote.\r\n\r\nEver and again Capes appealed to Ann Veronica. He liked to draw her in,\r\nand she did her best to talk. But she did not talk readily, and in\r\norder to say something she plunged a little, and felt she plunged.\r\nCapes scored back with an uncompromising vigor that was his way of\r\ncomplimenting her intelligence. But this afternoon it discovered an\r\nunusual vein of irritability in her. He had been reading Belfort Bax,\r\nand declared himself a convert. He contrasted the lot of women in\r\ngeneral with the lot of men, presented men as patient, self-immolating\r\nmartyrs, and women as the pampered favorites of Nature. A vein of\r\nconviction mingled with his burlesque.\r\n\r\nFor a time he and Miss Klegg contradicted one another.\r\n\r\nThe question ceased to be a tea-table talk, and became suddenly\r\ntragically real for Ann Veronica. There he sat, cheerfully friendly\r\nin his sex\u2019s freedom--the man she loved, the one man she cared\r\nshould unlock the way to the wide world for her imprisoned feminine\r\npossibilities, and he seemed regardless that she stifled under his eyes;\r\nhe made a jest of all this passionate insurgence of the souls of women\r\nagainst the fate of their conditions.\r\n\r\nMiss Garvice repeated again, and almost in the same words she used at\r\nevery discussion, her contribution to the great question.\r\n\r\nShe thought that women were not made for the struggle and turmoil of\r\nlife--their place was the little world, the home; that their power lay\r\nnot in votes but in influence over men and in making the minds of their\r\nchildren fine and splendid.\r\n\r\n\u201cWomen should understand men\u2019s affairs, perhaps,\u201d said Miss Garvice,\r\n\u201cbut to mingle in them is just to sacrifice that power of influencing\r\nthey can exercise now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere IS something sound in that position,\u201d said Capes, intervening as\r\nif to defend Miss Garvice against a possible attack from Ann Veronica.\r\n\u201cIt may not be just and so forth, but, after all, it is how things are.\r\nWomen are not in the world in the same sense that men are--fighting\r\nindividuals in a scramble. I don\u2019t see how they can be. Every home is a\r\nlittle recess, a niche, out of the world of business and competition, in\r\nwhich women and the future shelter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA little pit!\u201d said Ann Veronica; \u201ca little prison!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just as often a little refuge. Anyhow, that is how things are.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the man stands as the master at the mouth of the den.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs sentinel. You forget all the mass of training and tradition and\r\ninstinct that go to make him a tolerable master. Nature is a mother; her\r\nsympathies have always been feminist, and she has tempered the man to\r\nthe shorn woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish,\u201d said Ann Veronica, with sudden anger, \u201cthat you could know\r\nwhat it is to live in a pit!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stood up as she spoke, and put down her cup beside Miss Garvice\u2019s.\r\nShe addressed Capes as though she spoke to him alone.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t endure it,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\nEvery one turned to her in astonishment.\r\n\r\nShe felt she had to go on. \u201cNo man can realize,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat that\r\npit can be. The way--the way we are led on! We are taught to believe we\r\nare free in the world, to think we are queens.... Then we find out.\r\nWe find out no man will treat a woman fairly as man to man--no man. He\r\nwants you--or he doesn\u2019t; and then he helps some other woman against\r\nyou.... What you say is probably all true and necessary.... But\r\nthink of the disillusionment! Except for our sex we have minds like men,\r\ndesires like men. We come out into the world, some of us--\u201d\r\n\r\nShe paused. Her words, as she said them, seemed to her to mean nothing,\r\nand there was so much that struggled for expression. \u201cWomen are mocked,\u201d\r\n she said. \u201cWhenever they try to take hold of life a man intervenes.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe felt, with a sudden horror, that she might weep. She wished she had\r\nnot stood up. She wondered wildly why she had stood up. No one spoke,\r\nand she was impelled to flounder on. \u201cThink of the mockery!\u201d she said.\r\n\u201cThink how dumb we find ourselves and stifled! I know we seem to have\r\na sort of freedom.... Have you ever tried to run and jump in\r\npetticoats, Mr. Capes? Well, think what it must be to live in them--soul\r\nand mind and body! It\u2019s fun for a man to jest at our position.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t jesting,\u201d said Capes, abruptly.\r\n\r\nShe stood face to face with him, and his voice cut across her speech\r\nand made her stop abruptly. She was sore and overstrung, and it was\r\nintolerable to her that he should stand within three yards of her\r\nunsuspectingly, with an incalculably vast power over her happiness. She\r\nwas sore with the perplexities of her preposterous position. She was\r\nsick of herself, of her life, of everything but him; and for him all her\r\nmasked and hidden being was crying out.\r\n\r\nShe stopped abruptly at the sound of his voice, and lost the thread\r\nof what she was saying. In the pause she realized the attention of the\r\nothers converged upon her, and that the tears were brimming over her\r\neyes. She felt a storm of emotion surging up within her. She became\r\naware of the Scotch student regarding her with stupendous amazement,\r\na tea-cup poised in one hairy hand and his faceted glasses showing a\r\nvarious enlargement of segments of his eye.\r\n\r\nThe door into the passage offered itself with an irresistible\r\ninvitation--the one alternative to a public, inexplicable passion of\r\nweeping.\r\n\r\nCapes flashed to an understanding of her intention, sprang to his feet,\r\nand opened the door for her retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 8\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy should I ever come back?\u201d she said to herself, as she went down the\r\nstaircase.\r\n\r\nShe went to the post-office and drew out and sent off her money\r\nto Ramage. And then she came out into the street, sure only of one\r\nthing--that she could not return directly to her lodgings. She wanted\r\nair--and the distraction of having moving and changing things about her.\r\nThe evenings were beginning to draw out, and it would not be dark for\r\nan hour. She resolved to walk across the Park to the Zoological gardens,\r\nand so on by way of Primrose Hill to Hampstead Heath. There she would\r\nwander about in the kindly darkness. And think things out....\r\n\r\nPresently she became aware of footsteps hurrying after her, and glanced\r\nback to find Miss Klegg, a little out of breath, in pursuit.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica halted a pace, and Miss Klegg came alongside.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo YOU go across the Park?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot usually. But I\u2019m going to-day. I want a walk.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised at it. I thought Mr. Capes most trying.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it wasn\u2019t that. I\u2019ve had a headache all day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought Mr. Capes most unfair,\u201d Miss Klegg went on in a small, even\r\nvoice; \u201cMOST unfair! I\u2019m glad you spoke out as you did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mind that little argument.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou gave it him well. What you said wanted saying. After you went he\r\ngot up and took refuge in the preparation-room. Or else _I_ would have\r\nfinished him.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica said nothing, and Miss Klegg went on: \u201cHe very often\r\nIS--most unfair. He has a way of sitting on people. He wouldn\u2019t like it\r\nif people did it to him. He jumps the words out of your mouth; he takes\r\nhold of what you have to say before you have had time to express it\r\nproperly.\u201d\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose he\u2019s frightfully clever,\u201d said Miss Klegg.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Fellow of the Royal Society, and he can\u2019t be much over thirty,\u201d\r\n said Miss Klegg.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe writes very well,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe can\u2019t be more than thirty. He must have married when he was quite a\r\nyoung man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMarried?\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you know he was married?\u201d asked Miss Klegg, and was struck by a\r\nthought that made her glance quickly at her companion.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica had no answer for a moment. She turned her head away\r\nsharply. Some automaton within her produced in a quite unfamiliar voice\r\nthe remark, \u201cThey\u2019re playing football.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s too far for the ball to reach us,\u201d said Miss Klegg.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know Mr. Capes was married,\u201d said Ann Veronica, resuming the\r\nconversation with an entire disappearance of her former lassitude.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Miss Klegg; \u201cI thought every one knew.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ann Veronica, offhandedly. \u201cNever heard anything of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought every one knew. I thought every one had heard about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s married--and, I believe, living separated from his wife. There was\r\na case, or something, some years ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat case?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA divorce--or something--I don\u2019t know. But I have heard that he almost\r\nhad to leave the schools. If it hadn\u2019t been for Professor Russell\r\nstanding up for him, they say he would have had to leave.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas he divorced, do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but he got himself mixed up in a divorce case. I forget the\r\nparticulars, but I know it was something very disagreeable. It was among\r\nartistic people.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica was silent for a while.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought every one had heard,\u201d said Miss Klegg. \u201cOr I wouldn\u2019t have\r\nsaid anything about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose all men,\u201d said Ann Veronica, in a tone of detached criticism,\r\n\u201cget some such entanglement. And, anyhow, it doesn\u2019t matter to us.\u201d She\r\nturned abruptly at right angles to the path they followed. \u201cThis is my\r\nway back to my side of the Park,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you were coming right across the Park.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no,\u201d said Ann Veronica; \u201cI have some work to do. I just wanted a\r\nbreath of air. And they\u2019ll shut the gates presently. It\u2019s not far from\r\ntwilight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 9\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was sitting brooding over her fire about ten o\u2019clock that night when\r\na sealed and registered envelope was brought up to her.\r\n\r\nShe opened it and drew out a letter, and folded within it were the notes\r\nshe had sent off to Ramage that day. The letter began:\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cMY DEAREST GIRL,--I cannot let you do this foolish thing--\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nShe crumpled notes and letter together in her hand, and then with a\r\npassionate gesture flung them into the fire. Instantly she seized the\r\npoker and made a desperate effort to get them out again. But she was\r\nonly able to save a corner of the letter. The twenty pounds burned with\r\navidity.\r\n\r\nShe remained for some seconds crouching at the fender, poker in hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy Jove!\u201d she said, standing up at last, \u201cthat about finishes it, Ann\r\nVeronica!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE TENTH\r\n\r\nTHE SUFFRAGETTES\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is only one way out of all this,\u201d said Ann Veronica, sitting up\r\nin her little bed in the darkness and biting at her nails.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought I was just up against Morningside Park and father, but it\u2019s\r\nthe whole order of things--the whole blessed order of things....\u201d\r\n\r\nShe shivered. She frowned and gripped her hands about her knees very\r\ntightly. Her mind developed into savage wrath at the present conditions\r\nof a woman\u2019s life.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose all life is an affair of chances. But a woman\u2019s life is all\r\nchance. It\u2019s artificially chance. Find your man, that\u2019s the rule. All\r\nthe rest is humbug and delicacy. He\u2019s the handle of life for you. He\r\nwill let you live if it pleases him....\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t it be altered?\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose an actress is free?...\u201d\r\n\r\nShe tried to think of some altered state of affairs in which these\r\nmonstrous limitations would be alleviated, in which women would stand on\r\ntheir own feet in equal citizenship with men. For a time she brooded on\r\nthe ideals and suggestions of the Socialists, on the vague intimations\r\nof an Endowment of Motherhood, of a complete relaxation of that intense\r\nindividual dependence for women which is woven into the existing social\r\norder. At the back of her mind there seemed always one irrelevant\r\nqualifying spectator whose presence she sought to disregard. She would\r\nnot look at him, would not think of him; when her mind wavered, then\r\nshe muttered to herself in the darkness so as to keep hold of her\r\ngeneralizations.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is true. It is no good waiving the thing; it is true. Unless women\r\nare never to be free, never to be even respected, there must be a\r\ngeneration of martyrs.... Why shouldn\u2019t we be martyrs? There\u2019s\r\nnothing else for most of us, anyhow. It\u2019s a sort of blacklegging to want\r\nto have a life of one\u2019s own....\u201d\r\n\r\nShe repeated, as if she answered an objector: \u201cA sort of blacklegging.\r\n\r\n\u201cA sex of blacklegging clients.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer mind diverged to other aspects, and another type of womanhood.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor little Miniver! What can she be but what she is?... Because\r\nshe states her case in a tangle, drags it through swamps of nonsense, it\r\ndoesn\u2019t alter the fact that she is right.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat phrase about dragging the truth through swamps of nonsense she\r\nremembered from Capes. At the recollection that it was his, she seemed\r\nto fall through a thin surface, as one might fall through the crust of\r\na lava into glowing depths. She wallowed for a time in the thought of\r\nCapes, unable to escape from his image and the idea of his presence in\r\nher life.\r\n\r\nShe let her mind run into dreams of that cloud paradise of an altered\r\nworld in which the Goopes and Minivers, the Fabians and reforming people\r\nbelieved. Across that world was written in letters of light, \u201cEndowment\r\nof Motherhood.\u201d Suppose in some complex yet conceivable way women were\r\nendowed, were no longer economically and socially dependent on men. \u201cIf\r\none was free,\u201d she said, \u201cone could go to him.... This vile hovering\r\nto catch a man\u2019s eye!... One could go to him and tell him one loved\r\nhim. I want to love him. A little love from him would be enough. It\r\nwould hurt no one. It would not burden him with any obligation.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe groaned aloud and bowed her forehead to her knees. She floundered\r\ndeep. She wanted to kiss his feet. His feet would have the firm texture\r\nof his hands.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly her spirit rose in revolt. \u201cI will not have this slavery,\u201d\r\n she said. \u201cI will not have this slavery.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe shook her fist ceilingward. \u201cDo you hear!\u201d she said \u201cwhatever you\r\nare, wherever you are! I will not be slave to the thought of any man,\r\nslave to the customs of any time. Confound this slavery of sex! I am a\r\nman! I will get this under if I am killed in doing it!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe scowled into the cold blacknesses about her.\r\n\r\n\u201cManning,\u201d she said, and contemplated a figure of inaggressive\r\npersistence. \u201cNo!\u201d Her thoughts had turned in a new direction.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said, after a long interval, \u201cif they are\r\nabsurd. They mean something. They mean everything that women can\r\nmean--except submission. The vote is only the beginning, the necessary\r\nbeginning. If we do not begin--\u201d\r\n\r\nShe had come to a resolution. Abruptly she got out of bed, smoothed\r\nher sheet and straightened her pillow and lay down, and fell almost\r\ninstantly asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning was as dark and foggy as if it was mid-November instead\r\nof early March. Ann Veronica woke rather later than usual, and lay awake\r\nfor some minutes before she remembered a certain resolution she\r\nhad taken in the small hours. Then instantly she got out of bed and\r\nproceeded to dress.\r\n\r\nShe did not start for the Imperial College. She spent the morning up\r\nto ten in writing a series of unsuccessful letters to Ramage, which she\r\ntore up unfinished; and finally she desisted and put on her jacket and\r\nwent out into the lamp-lit obscurity and slimy streets. She turned a\r\nresolute face southward.\r\n\r\nShe followed Oxford Street into Holborn, and then she inquired for\r\nChancery Lane. There she sought and at last found 107A, one of those\r\nheterogeneous piles of offices which occupy the eastern side of the\r\nlane. She studied the painted names of firms and persons and enterprises\r\non the wall, and discovered that the Women\u2019s Bond of Freedom occupied\r\nseveral contiguous suites on the first floor. She went up-stairs and\r\nhesitated between four doors with ground-glass panes, each of which\r\nprofessed \u201cThe Women\u2019s Bond of Freedom\u201d in neat black letters. She\r\nopened one and found herself in a large untidy room set with chairs that\r\nwere a little disarranged as if by an overnight meeting. On the walls\r\nwere notice-boards bearing clusters of newspaper slips, three or four\r\nbig posters of monster meetings, one of which Ann Veronica had attended\r\nwith Miss Miniver, and a series of announcements in purple copying-ink,\r\nand in one corner was a pile of banners. There was no one at all in this\r\nroom, but through the half-open door of one of the small apartments\r\nthat gave upon it she had a glimpse of two very young girls sitting at a\r\nlittered table and writing briskly.\r\n\r\nShe walked across to this apartment and, opening the door a little\r\nwider, discovered a press section of the movement at work.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to inquire,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cNext door,\u201d said a spectacled young person of seventeen or eighteen,\r\nwith an impatient indication of the direction.\r\n\r\nIn the adjacent apartment Ann Veronica found a middle-aged woman with\r\na tired face under the tired hat she wore, sitting at a desk opening\r\nletters while a dusky, untidy girl of eight-or nine-and-twenty hammered\r\nindustriously at a typewriter. The tired woman looked up in inquiring\r\nsilence at Ann Veronica\u2019s diffident entry.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to know more about this movement,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you with us?\u201d said the tired woman.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Ann Veronica; \u201cI think I am. I want very much to do\r\nsomething for women. But I want to know what you are doing.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe tired woman sat still for a moment. \u201cYou haven\u2019t come here to make a\r\nlot of difficulties?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ann Veronica, \u201cbut I want to know.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe tired woman shut her eyes tightly for a moment, and then looked with\r\nthem at Ann Veronica. \u201cWhat can you do?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you prepared to do things for us? Distribute bills? Write letters?\r\nInterrupt meetings? Canvass at elections? Face dangers?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I am satisfied--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we satisfy you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, if possible, I would like to go to prison.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t nice going to prison.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would suit me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t nice getting there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a question of detail,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\nThe tired woman looked quietly at her. \u201cWhat are your objections?\u201d she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t objections exactly. I want to know what you are doing; how you\r\nthink this work of yours really does serve women.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are working for the equal citizenship of men and women,\u201d said the\r\ntired woman. \u201cWomen have been and are treated as the inferiors of men,\r\nwe want to make them their equals.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Ann Veronica, \u201cI agree to that. But--\u201d\r\n\r\nThe tired woman raised her eyebrows in mild protest.\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t the question more complicated than that?\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou could have a talk to Miss Kitty Brett this afternoon, if you liked.\r\nShall I make an appointment for you?\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Kitty Brett was one of the most conspicuous leaders of the\r\nmovement. Ann Veronica snatched at the opportunity, and spent most\r\nof the intervening time in the Assyrian Court of the British Museum,\r\nreading and thinking over a little book upon the feminist movement the\r\ntired woman had made her buy. She got a bun and some cocoa in the little\r\nrefreshment-room, and then wandered through the galleries up-stairs,\r\ncrowded with Polynesian idols and Polynesian dancing-garments, and all\r\nthe simple immodest accessories to life in Polynesia, to a seat among\r\nthe mummies. She was trying to bring her problems to a head, and her\r\nmind insisted upon being even more discursive and atmospheric than\r\nusual. It generalized everything she put to it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy should women be dependent on men?\u201d she asked; and the question was\r\nat once converted into a system of variations upon the theme of \u201cWhy\r\nare things as they are?\u201d--\u201cWhy are human beings viviparous?\u201d--\u201cWhy are\r\npeople hungry thrice a day?\u201d--\u201cWhy does one faint at danger?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stood for a time looking at the dry limbs and still human face of\r\nthat desiccated unwrapped mummy from the very beginnings of social life.\r\nIt looked very patient, she thought, and a little self-satisfied. It\r\nlooked as if it had taken its world for granted and prospered on that\r\nassumption--a world in which children were trained to obey their\r\nelders and the wills of women over-ruled as a matter of course. It was\r\nwonderful to think this thing had lived, had felt and suffered. Perhaps\r\nonce it had desired some other human being intolerably. Perhaps some one\r\nhad kissed the brow that was now so cadaverous, rubbed that sunken cheek\r\nwith loving fingers, held that stringy neck with passionately living\r\nhands. But all of that was forgotten. \u201cIn the end,\u201d it seemed to be\r\nthinking, \u201cthey embalmed me with the utmost respect--sound spices chosen\r\nto endure--the best! I took my world as I found it. THINGS ARE SO!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3\r\n\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica\u2019s first impression of Kitty Brett was that she was\r\naggressive and disagreeable; her next that she was a person of amazing\r\npersuasive power. She was perhaps three-and-twenty, and very pink and\r\nhealthy-looking, showing a great deal of white and rounded neck above\r\nher business-like but altogether feminine blouse, and a good deal of\r\nplump, gesticulating forearm out of her short sleeve. She had animated\r\ndark blue-gray eyes under her fine eyebrows, and dark brown hair that\r\nrolled back simply and effectively from her broad low forehead. And she\r\nwas about as capable of intelligent argument as a runaway steam-roller.\r\nShe was a trained being--trained by an implacable mother to one end.\r\n\r\nShe spoke with fluent enthusiasm. She did not so much deal with Ann\r\nVeronica\u2019s interpolations as dispose of them with quick and use-hardened\r\nrepartee, and then she went on with a fine directness to sketch the case\r\nfor her agitation, for that remarkable rebellion of the women that was\r\nthen agitating the whole world of politics and discussion. She assumed\r\nwith a kind of mesmeric force all the propositions that Ann Veronica\r\nwanted her to define.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do we want? What is the goal?\u201d asked Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cFreedom! Citizenship! And the way to that--the way to everything--is\r\nthe Vote.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica said something about a general change of ideas.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can you change people\u2019s ideas if you have no power?\u201d said Kitty\r\nBrett.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica was not ready enough to deal with that counter-stroke.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne doesn\u2019t want to turn the whole thing into a mere sex antagonism.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen women get justice,\u201d said Kitty Brett, \u201cthere will be no sex\r\nantagonism. None at all. Until then we mean to keep on hammering away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me that much of a woman\u2019s difficulties are economic.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will follow,\u201d said Kitty Brett--\u201cthat will follow.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe interrupted as Ann Veronica was about to speak again, with a bright\r\ncontagious hopefulness. \u201cEverything will follow,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Ann Veronica, trying to think where they were, trying to\r\nget things plain again that had seemed plain enough in the quiet of the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing was ever done,\u201d Miss Brett asserted, \u201cwithout a certain element\r\nof Faith. After we have got the Vote and are recognized as citizens,\r\nthen we can come to all these other things.\u201d\r\n\r\nEven in the glamour of Miss Brett\u2019s assurance it seemed to Ann Veronica\r\nthat this was, after all, no more than the gospel of Miss Miniver with\r\na new set of resonances. And like that gospel it meant something,\r\nsomething different from its phrases, something elusive, and yet\r\nsomething that in spite of the superficial incoherence of its phrasing,\r\nwas largely essentially true. There was something holding women down,\r\nholding women back, and if it wasn\u2019t exactly man-made law, man-made\r\nlaw was an aspect of it. There was something indeed holding the whole\r\nspecies back from the imaginable largeness of life....\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Vote is the symbol of everything,\u201d said Miss Brett.\r\n\r\nShe made an abrupt personal appeal.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! please don\u2019t lose yourself in a wilderness of secondary\r\nconsiderations,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me to tell you all that women can\r\ndo, all that women can be. There is a new life, different from the old\r\nlife of dependence, possible. If only we are not divided. If only we\r\nwork together. This is the one movement that brings women of different\r\nclasses together for a common purpose. If you could see how it gives\r\nthem souls, women who have taken things for granted, who have given\r\nthemselves up altogether to pettiness and vanity....\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGive me something to do,\u201d said Ann Veronica, interrupting her\r\npersuasions at last. \u201cIt has been very kind of you to see me, but I\r\ndon\u2019t want to sit and talk and use your time any longer. I want to do\r\nsomething. I want to hammer myself against all this that pens women in.\r\nI feel that I shall stifle unless I can do something--and do something\r\nsoon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 4\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not Ann Veronica\u2019s fault that the night\u2019s work should have taken\r\nupon itself the forms of wild burlesque. She was in deadly earnest in\r\neverything she did. It seemed to her the last desperate attack upon the\r\nuniverse that would not let her live as she desired to live, that penned\r\nher in and controlled her and directed her and disapproved of her, the\r\nsame invincible wrappering, the same leaden tyranny of a universe that\r\nshe had vowed to overcome after that memorable conflict with her father\r\nat Morningside Park.\r\n\r\nShe was listed for the raid--she was informed it was to be a raid upon\r\nthe House of Commons, though no particulars were given her--and told to\r\ngo alone to 14, Dexter Street, Westminster, and not to ask any policeman\r\nto direct her. 14, Dexter Street, Westminster, she found was not a house\r\nbut a yard in an obscure street, with big gates and the name of Podgers\r\n& Carlo, Carriers and Furniture Removers, thereon. She was perplexed by\r\nthis, and stood for some seconds in the empty street hesitating, until\r\nthe appearance of another circumspect woman under the street lamp at the\r\ncorner reassured her. In one of the big gates was a little door, and she\r\nrapped at this. It was immediately opened by a man with light eyelashes\r\nand a manner suggestive of restrained passion. \u201cCome right in,\u201d he\r\nhissed under his breath, with the true conspirator\u2019s note, closed the\r\ndoor very softly and pointed, \u201cThrough there!\u201d\r\n\r\nBy the meagre light of a gas lamp she perceived a cobbled yard with four\r\nlarge furniture vans standing with horses and lamps alight. A slender\r\nyoung man, wearing glasses, appeared from the shadow of the nearest van.\r\n\u201cAre you A, B, C, or D?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey told me D,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cThrough there,\u201d he said, and pointed with the pamphlet he was carrying.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica found herself in a little stirring crowd of excited women,\r\nwhispering and tittering and speaking in undertones.\r\n\r\nThe light was poor, so that she saw their gleaming faces dimly and\r\nindistinctly. No one spoke to her. She stood among them, watching\r\nthem and feeling curiously alien to them. The oblique ruddy lighting\r\ndistorted them oddly, made queer bars and patches of shadow upon their\r\nclothes. \u201cIt\u2019s Kitty\u2019s idea,\u201d said one, \u201cwe are to go in the vans.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKitty is wonderful,\u201d said another.\r\n\r\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have always longed for prison service,\u201d said a voice, \u201calways.\r\nFrom the beginning. But it\u2019s only now I\u2019m able to do it.\u201d\r\n\r\nA little blond creature close at hand suddenly gave way to a fit of\r\nhysterical laughter, and caught up the end of it with a sob.\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore I took up the Suffrage,\u201d a firm, flat voice remarked, \u201cI could\r\nscarcely walk up-stairs without palpitations.\u201d\r\n\r\nSome one hidden from Ann Veronica appeared to be marshalling the\r\nassembly. \u201cWe have to get in, I think,\u201d said a nice little old lady in\r\na bonnet to Ann Veronica, speaking with a voice that quavered a little.\r\n\u201cMy dear, can you see in this light? I think I would like to get in.\r\nWhich is C?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica, with a curious sinking of the heart, regarded the black\r\ncavities of the vans. Their doors stood open, and placards with big\r\nletters indicated the section assigned to each. She directed the little\r\nold woman and then made her way to van D. A young woman with a white\r\nbadge on her arm stood and counted the sections as they entered their\r\nvans.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen they tap the roof,\u201d she said, in a voice of authority, \u201cyou are to\r\ncome out. You will be opposite the big entrance in Old Palace Yard. It\u2019s\r\nthe public entrance. You are to make for that and get into the lobby if\r\nyou can, and so try and reach the floor of the House, crying \u2018Votes for\r\nWomen!\u2019 as you go.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe spoke like a mistress addressing school-children.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t bunch too much as you come out,\u201d she added.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right?\u201d asked the man with the light eyelashes, suddenly appearing\r\nin the doorway. He waited for an instant, wasting an encouraging smile\r\nin the imperfect light, and then shut the doors of the van, leaving the\r\nwomen in darkness....\r\n\r\nThe van started with a jerk and rumbled on its way.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like Troy!\u201d said a voice of rapture. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly like Troy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 5\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Ann Veronica, enterprising and a little dubious as ever, mingled with\r\nthe stream of history and wrote her Christian name upon the police-court\r\nrecords of the land.\r\n\r\nBut out of a belated regard for her father she wrote the surname of some\r\none else.\r\n\r\nSome day, when the rewards of literature permit the arduous research\r\nrequired, the Campaign of the Women will find its Carlyle, and the\r\nparticulars of that marvellous series of exploits by which Miss Brett\r\nand her colleagues nagged the whole Western world into the discussion of\r\nwomen\u2019s position become the material for the most delightful and amazing\r\ndescriptions. At present the world waits for that writer, and the\r\nconfused record of the newspapers remains the only resource of the\r\ncurious. When he comes he will do that raid of the pantechnicons the\r\njustice it deserves; he will picture the orderly evening scene about the\r\nImperial Legislature in convincing detail, the coming and going of cabs\r\nand motor-cabs and broughams through the chill, damp evening into New\r\nPalace Yard, the reinforced but untroubled and unsuspecting police about\r\nthe entries of those great buildings whose square and panelled Victorian\r\nGothic streams up from the glare of the lamps into the murkiness of\r\nthe night; Big Ben shining overhead, an unassailable beacon, and the\r\nincidental traffic of Westminster, cabs, carts, and glowing omnibuses\r\ngoing to and from the bridge. About the Abbey and Abingdon Street stood\r\nthe outer pickets and detachments of the police, their attention all\r\ndirected westward to where the women in Caxton Hall, Westminster, hummed\r\nlike an angry hive. Squads reached to the very portal of that centre of\r\ndisturbance. And through all these defences and into Old Palace\r\nYard, into the very vitals of the defenders\u2019 position, lumbered the\r\nunsuspected vans.\r\n\r\nThey travelled past the few idle sightseers who had braved the\r\nuninviting evening to see what the Suffragettes might be doing; they\r\npulled up unchallenged within thirty yards of those coveted portals.\r\n\r\nAnd then they disgorged.\r\n\r\nWere I a painter of subject pictures, I would exhaust all my skill\r\nin proportion and perspective and atmosphere upon the august seat\r\nof empire, I would present it gray and dignified and immense and\r\nrespectable beyond any mere verbal description, and then, in vivid\r\nblack and very small, I would put in those valiantly impertinent\r\nvans, squatting at the base of its altitudes and pouring out a swift,\r\nstraggling rush of ominous little black objects, minute figures of\r\ndetermined women at war with the universe.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica was in their very forefront.\r\n\r\nIn an instant the expectant calm of Westminster was ended, and the very\r\nSpeaker in the chair blenched at the sound of the policemen\u2019s whistles.\r\nThe bolder members in the House left their places to go lobbyward,\r\ngrinning. Others pulled hats over their noses, cowered in their seats,\r\nand feigned that all was right with the world. In Old Palace Yard\r\neverybody ran. They either ran to see or ran for shelter. Even two\r\nCabinet Ministers took to their heels, grinning insincerely. At the\r\nopening of the van doors and the emergence into the fresh air Ann\r\nVeronica\u2019s doubt and depression gave place to the wildest exhilaration.\r\nThat same adventurousness that had already buoyed her through crises\r\nthat would have overwhelmed any normally feminine girl with shame and\r\nhorror now became uppermost again. Before her was a great Gothic portal.\r\nThrough that she had to go.\r\n\r\nPast her shot the little old lady in the bonnet, running incredibly\r\nfast, but otherwise still alertly respectable, and she was making a\r\nstrange threatening sound as she ran, such as one would use in driving\r\nducks out of a garden--\u201cB-r-r-r-r-r--!\u201d and pawing with black-gloved\r\nhands. The policemen were closing in from the sides to intervene. The\r\nlittle old lady struck like a projectile upon the resounding chest\r\nof the foremost of these, and then Ann Veronica had got past and was\r\nascending the steps.\r\n\r\nThen most horribly she was clasped about the waist from behind and\r\nlifted from the ground.\r\n\r\nAt that a new element poured into her excitement, an element of wild\r\ndisgust and terror. She had never experienced anything so disagreeable\r\nin her life as the sense of being held helplessly off her feet. She\r\nscreamed involuntarily--she had never in her life screamed before--and\r\nthen she began to wriggle and fight like a frightened animal against the\r\nmen who were holding her.\r\n\r\nThe affair passed at one leap from a spree to a nightmare of violence\r\nand disgust. Her hair got loose, her hat came over one eye, and she had\r\nno arm free to replace it. She felt she must suffocate if these men did\r\nnot put her down, and for a time they would not put her down. Then with\r\nan indescribable relief her feet were on the pavement, and she was\r\nbeing urged along by two policemen, who were gripping her wrists in an\r\nirresistible expert manner. She was writhing to get her hands loose\r\nand found herself gasping with passionate violence, \u201cIt\u2019s\r\ndamnable!--damnable!\u201d to the manifest disgust of the fatherly policeman\r\non her right.\r\n\r\nThen they had released her arms and were trying to push her away.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou be off, missie,\u201d said the fatherly policeman. \u201cThis ain\u2019t no place\r\nfor you.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe pushed her a dozen yards along the greasy pavement with flat,\r\nwell-trained hands that there seemed to be no opposing. Before her\r\nstretched blank spaces, dotted with running people coming toward her,\r\nand below them railings and a statue. She almost submitted to this\r\nending of her adventure. But at the word \u201chome\u201d she turned again.\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t go home,\u201d she said; \u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d and she evaded the clutch of the\r\nfatherly policeman and tried to thrust herself past him in the direction\r\nof that big portal. \u201cSteady on!\u201d he cried.\r\n\r\nA diversion was created by the violent struggles of the little old\r\nlady. She seemed to be endowed with superhuman strength. A knot of\r\nthree policemen in conflict with her staggered toward Ann Veronica\u2019s\r\nattendants and distracted their attention. \u201cI WILL be arrested! I WON\u2019T\r\ngo home!\u201d the little old lady was screaming over and over again. They\r\nput her down, and she leaped at them; she smote a helmet to the ground.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to take her!\u201d shouted an inspector on horseback, and she\r\nechoed his cry: \u201cYou\u2019ll have to take me!\u201d They seized upon her and\r\nlifted her, and she screamed. Ann Veronica became violently excited at\r\nthe sight. \u201cYou cowards!\u201d said Ann Veronica, \u201cput her down!\u201d and tore\r\nherself from a detaining hand and battered with her fists upon the big\r\nred ear and blue shoulder of the policeman who held the little old lady.\r\n\r\nSo Ann Veronica also was arrested.\r\n\r\nAnd then came the vile experience of being forced and borne along the\r\nstreet to the police-station. Whatever anticipation Ann Veronica had\r\nformed of this vanished in the reality. Presently she was going through\r\na swaying, noisy crowd, whose faces grinned and stared pitilessly in the\r\nlight of the electric standards. \u201cGo it, miss!\u201d cried one. \u201cKick aht at\r\n\u2018em!\u201d though, indeed, she went now with Christian meekness, resenting\r\nonly the thrusting policemen\u2019s hands. Several people in the crowd seemed\r\nto be fighting. Insulting cries became frequent and various, but for the\r\nmost part she could not understand what was said. \u201cWho\u2019ll mind the baby\r\nnar?\u201d was one of the night\u2019s inspirations, and very frequent. A lean\r\nyoung man in spectacles pursued her for some time, crying \u201cCourage!\r\nCourage!\u201d Somebody threw a dab of mud at her, and some of it got down\r\nher neck. Immeasurable disgust possessed her. She felt draggled and\r\ninsulted beyond redemption.\r\n\r\nShe could not hide her face. She attempted by a sheer act of will to\r\nend the scene, to will herself out of it anywhere. She had a horrible\r\nglimpse of the once nice little old lady being also borne stationward,\r\nstill faintly battling and very muddy--one lock of grayish hair\r\nstraggling over her neck, her face scared, white, but triumphant. Her\r\nbonnet dropped off and was trampled into the gutter. A little Cockney\r\nrecovered it, and made ridiculous attempts to get to her and replace it.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must arrest me!\u201d she gasped, breathlessly, insisting insanely on a\r\npoint already carried; \u201cyou shall!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe police-station at the end seemed to Ann Veronica like a refuge from\r\nunnamable disgraces. She hesitated about her name, and, being prompted,\r\ngave it at last as Ann Veronica Smith, 107A, Chancery Lane....\r\n\r\nIndignation carried her through that night, that men and the world\r\ncould so entreat her. The arrested women were herded in a passage of\r\nthe Panton Street Police-station that opened upon a cell too unclean for\r\noccupation, and most of them spent the night standing. Hot coffee\r\nand cakes were sent in to them in the morning by some intelligent\r\nsympathizer, or she would have starved all day. Submission to the\r\ninevitable carried her through the circumstances of her appearance\r\nbefore the magistrate.\r\n\r\nHe was no doubt doing his best to express the attitude of society toward\r\nthese wearily heroic defendants, but he seemed to be merely rude and\r\nunfair to Ann Veronica. He was not, it seemed, the proper stipendiary at\r\nall, and there had been some demur to his jurisdiction that had ruffled\r\nhim. He resented being regarded as irregular. He felt he was human\r\nwisdom prudentially interpolated.... \u201cYou silly wimmin,\u201d he said over\r\nand over again throughout the hearing, plucking at his blotting-pad\r\nwith busy hands. \u201cYou silly creatures! Ugh! Fie upon you!\u201d The court was\r\ncrowded with people, for the most part supporters and admirers of the\r\ndefendants, and the man with the light eyelashes was conspicuously\r\nactive and omnipresent.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica\u2019s appearance was brief and undistinguished. She had nothing\r\nto say for herself. She was guided into the dock and prompted by a\r\nhelpful police inspector. She was aware of the body of the court,\r\nof clerks seated at a black table littered with papers, of policemen\r\nstanding about stiffly with expressions of conscious integrity, and\r\na murmuring background of the heads and shoulders of spectators close\r\nbehind her. On a high chair behind a raised counter the stipendiary\u2019s\r\nsubstitute regarded her malevolently over his glasses. A disagreeable\r\nyoung man, with red hair and a loose mouth, seated at the reporter\u2019s\r\ntable, was only too manifestly sketching her.\r\n\r\nShe was interested by the swearing of the witnesses. The kissing of the\r\nbook struck her as particularly odd, and then the policemen gave their\r\nevidence in staccato jerks and stereotyped phrases.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you anything to ask the witness?\u201d asked the helpful inspector.\r\n\r\nThe ribald demons that infested the back of Ann Veronica\u2019s mind urged\r\nvarious facetious interrogations upon her, as, for example, where\r\nthe witness had acquired his prose style. She controlled herself, and\r\nanswered meekly, \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Ann Veronica Smith,\u201d the magistrate remarked when the case was\r\nall before him, \u201cyou\u2019re a good-looking, strong, respectable gell, and\r\nit\u2019s a pity you silly young wimmin can\u2019t find something better to do\r\nwith your exuberance. Two-and-twenty! I can\u2019t imagine what your parents\r\ncan be thinking about to let you get into these scrapes.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica\u2019s mind was filled with confused unutterable replies.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are persuaded to come and take part in these outrageous\r\nproceedings--many of you, I am convinced, have no idea whatever of\r\ntheir nature. I don\u2019t suppose you could tell me even the derivation of\r\nsuffrage if I asked you. No! not even the derivation! But the fashion\u2019s\r\nbeen set and in it you must be.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe men at the reporter\u2019s table lifted their eyebrows, smiled faintly,\r\nand leaned back to watch how she took her scolding. One with the\r\nappearance of a bald little gnome yawned agonizingly. They had got all\r\nthis down already--they heard the substance of it now for the fourteenth\r\ntime. The stipendiary would have done it all very differently.\r\n\r\nShe found presently she was out of the dock and confronted with the\r\nalternative of being bound over in one surety for the sum of forty\r\npounds--whatever that might mean or a month\u2019s imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\u201cSecond class,\u201d said some one, but first and second were all alike to\r\nher. She elected to go to prison.\r\n\r\nAt last, after a long rumbling journey in a stuffy windowless van, she\r\nreached Canongate Prison--for Holloway had its quota already. It was bad\r\nluck to go to Canongate.\r\n\r\nPrison was beastly. Prison was bleak without spaciousness, and pervaded\r\nby a faint, oppressive smell; and she had to wait two hours in the\r\nsullenly defiant company of two unclean women thieves before a cell\r\ncould be assigned to her. Its dreariness, like the filthiness of the\r\npolice cell, was a discovery for her. She had imagined that prisons\r\nwere white-tiled places, reeking of lime-wash and immaculately\r\nsanitary. Instead, they appeared to be at the hygienic level of tramps\u2019\r\nlodging-houses. She was bathed in turbid water that had already been\r\nused. She was not allowed to bathe herself: another prisoner, with a\r\nprivileged manner, washed her. Conscientious objectors to that process\r\nare not permitted, she found, in Canongate. Her hair was washed for her\r\nalso. Then they dressed her in a dirty dress of coarse serge and a cap,\r\nand took away her own clothes. The dress came to her only too manifestly\r\nunwashed from its former wearer; even the under-linen they gave her\r\nseemed unclean. Horrible memories of things seen beneath the microscope\r\nof the baser forms of life crawled across her mind and set her\r\nshuddering with imagined irritations. She sat on the edge of the\r\nbed--the wardress was too busy with the flood of arrivals that day\r\nto discover that she had it down--and her skin was shivering from the\r\ncontact of these garments. She surveyed accommodation that seemed at\r\nfirst merely austere, and became more and more manifestly inadequate as\r\nthe moments fled by. She meditated profoundly through several enormous\r\ncold hours on all that had happened and all that she had done since the\r\nswirl of the suffrage movement had submerged her personal affairs....\r\n\r\nVery slowly emerging out of a phase of stupefaction, these personal\r\naffairs and her personal problem resumed possession of her mind. She had\r\nimagined she had drowned them altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE ELEVENTH\r\n\r\nTHOUGHTS IN PRISON\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 1\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first night in prison she found it impossible to sleep. The bed\r\nwas hard beyond any experience of hers, the bed-clothes coarse and\r\ninsufficient, the cell at once cold and stuffy. The little grating\r\nin the door, the sense of constant inspection, worried her. She kept\r\nopening her eyes and looking at it. She was fatigued physically and\r\nmentally, and neither mind nor body could rest. She became aware that\r\nat regular intervals a light flashed upon her face and a bodiless eye\r\nregarded her, and this, as the night wore on, became a torment....\r\n\r\nCapes came back into her mind. He haunted a state between hectic\r\ndreaming and mild delirium, and she found herself talking aloud to\r\nhim. All through the night an entirely impossible and monumental\r\nCapes confronted her, and she argued with him about men and women. She\r\nvisualized him as in a policeman\u2019s uniform and quite impassive. On some\r\ninsane score she fancied she had to state her case in verse. \u201cWe are the\r\nmusic and you are the instrument,\u201d she said; \u201cwe are verse and you are\r\nprose.\r\n\r\n     \u201cFor men have reason, women rhyme\r\n     A man scores always, all the time.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis couplet sprang into her mind from nowhere, and immediately begot an\r\nendless series of similar couplets that she began to compose and address\r\nto Capes. They came teeming distressfully through her aching brain:\r\n\r\n     \u201cA man can kick, his skirts don\u2019t tear;\r\n     A man scores always, everywhere.\r\n\r\n     \u201cHis dress for no man lays a snare;\r\n     A man scores always, everywhere.\r\n     For hats that fail and hats that flare;\r\n     Toppers their universal wear;\r\n     A man scores always, everywhere.\r\n\r\n     \u201cMen\u2019s waists are neither here nor there;\r\n     A man scores always, everywhere.\r\n\r\n     \u201cA man can manage without hair;\r\n     A man scores always, everywhere.\r\n\r\n     \u201cThere are no males at men to stare;\r\n     A man scores always, everywhere.\r\n\r\n     \u201cAnd children must we women bear--\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, damn!\u201d she cried, as the hundred-and-first couplet or so presented\r\nitself in her unwilling brain.\r\n\r\nFor a time she worried about that compulsory bath and cutaneous\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nThen she fell into a fever of remorse for the habit of bad language she\r\nhad acquired.\r\n\r\n     \u201cA man can smoke, a man can swear;\r\n     A man scores always, everywhere.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe rolled over on her face, and stuffed her fingers in her ears to shut\r\nout the rhythm from her mind. She lay still for a long time, and her\r\nmind resumed at a more tolerable pace. She found herself talking to\r\nCapes in an undertone of rational admission.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is something to be said for the lady-like theory after all,\u201d she\r\nadmitted. \u201cWomen ought to be gentle and submissive persons, strong only\r\nin virtue and in resistance to evil compulsion. My dear--I can call you\r\nthat here, anyhow--I know that. The Victorians over-did it a little, I\r\nadmit. Their idea of maidenly innocence was just a blank white--the sort\r\nof flat white that doesn\u2019t shine. But that doesn\u2019t alter the fact\r\nthat there IS innocence. And I\u2019ve read, and thought, and guessed, and\r\nlooked--until MY innocence--it\u2019s smirched.\r\n\r\n\u201cSmirched!...\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, dear, one IS passionately anxious for something--what is it?\r\nOne wants to be CLEAN. You want me to be clean. You would want me to be\r\nclean, if you gave me a thought, that is....\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder if you give me a thought....\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a good woman. I don\u2019t mean I\u2019m not a good woman--I mean that\r\nI\u2019m not a GOOD woman. My poor brain is so mixed, dear, I hardly know\r\nwhat I am saying. I mean I\u2019m not a good specimen of a woman. I\u2019ve got a\r\nstreak of male. Things happen to women--proper women--and all they have\r\nto do is to take them well. They\u2019ve just got to keep white. But I\u2019m\r\nalways trying to make things happen. And I get myself dirty...\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all dirt that washes off, dear, but it\u2019s dirt.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe white unaggressive woman who corrects and nurses and serves, and is\r\nworshipped and betrayed--the martyr-queen of men, the white mother....\r\nYou can\u2019t do that sort of thing unless you do it over religion, and\r\nthere\u2019s no religion in me--of that sort--worth a rap.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not gentle. Certainly not a gentlewoman.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not coarse--no! But I\u2019ve got no purity of mind--no real purity of\r\nmind. A good woman\u2019s mind has angels with flaming swords at the portals\r\nto keep out fallen thoughts....\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder if there are any good women really.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish I didn\u2019t swear. I do swear. It began as a joke.... It\r\ndeveloped into a sort of secret and private bad manners. It\u2019s got to be\r\nat last like tobacco-ash over all my sayings and doings....\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Go it, missie,\u2019 they said; \u201ckick aht!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI swore at that policeman--and disgusted him. Disgusted him!\r\n\r\n     \u201cFor men policemen never blush;\r\n     A man in all things scores so much...\r\n\r\n\u201cDamn! Things are getting plainer. It must be the dawn creeping in.\r\n\r\n     \u201cNow here hath been dawning another blue day;\r\n     I\u2019m just a poor woman, please take it away.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, sleep! Sleep! Sleep! Sleep!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Ann Veronica, after the half-hour of exercise, and sitting\r\non the uncomfortable wooden seat without a back that was her perch by\r\nday, \u201cit\u2019s no good staying here in a sort of maze. I\u2019ve got nothing to\r\ndo for a month but think. I may as well think. I ought to be able to\r\nthink things out.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow shall I put the question? What am I? What have I got to do with\r\nmyself?...\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder if many people HAVE thought things out?\r\n\r\n\u201cAre we all just seizing hold of phrases and obeying moods?\r\n\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so with old-fashioned people, they knew right from wrong;\r\nthey had a clear-cut, religious faith that seemed to explain everything\r\nand give a rule for everything. We haven\u2019t. I haven\u2019t, anyhow. And it\u2019s\r\nno good pretending there is one when there isn\u2019t.... I suppose I\r\nbelieve in God.... Never really thought about Him--people don\u2019t..\r\n.. I suppose my creed is, \u2018I believe rather indistinctly in God the\r\nFather Almighty, substratum of the evolutionary process, and, in a vein\r\nof vague sentimentality that doesn\u2019t give a datum for anything at all,\r\nin Jesus Christ, His Son.\u2019...\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no sort of good, Ann Veronica, pretending one does believe when\r\none doesn\u2019t....\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd as for praying for faith--this sort of monologue is about as near\r\nas any one of my sort ever gets to prayer. Aren\u2019t I asking--asking\r\nplainly now?...\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all been mixing our ideas, and we\u2019ve got intellectual hot\r\ncoppers--every blessed one of us....\r\n\r\n\u201cA confusion of motives--that\u2019s what I am!...\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is this absurd craving for Mr. Capes--the \u2018Capes crave,\u2019 they\r\nwould call it in America. Why do I want him so badly? Why do I want him,\r\nand think about him, and fail to get away from him?\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t all of me.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first person you love, Ann Veronica, is yourself--get hold of that!\r\nThe soul you have to save is Ann Veronica\u2019s soul....\u201d\r\n\r\nShe knelt upon the floor of her cell and clasped her hands, and remained\r\nfor a long time in silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, God!\u201d she said at last, \u201chow I wish I had been taught to pray!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had some idea of putting these subtle and difficult issues to the\r\nchaplain when she was warned of his advent. But she had not reckoned\r\nwith the etiquette of Canongate. She got up, as she had been told to\r\ndo, at his appearance, and he amazed her by sitting down, according to\r\ncustom, on her stool. He still wore his hat, to show that the days\r\nof miracles and Christ being civil to sinners are over forever. She\r\nperceived that his countenance was only composed by a great effort, his\r\nfeatures severely compressed. He was ruffled, and his ears were red,\r\nno doubt from some adjacent controversy. He classified her as he seated\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnother young woman, I suppose,\u201d he said, \u201cwho knows better than her\r\nMaker about her place in the world. Have you anything to ask me?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica readjusted her mind hastily. Her back stiffened. She\r\nproduced from the depths of her pride the ugly investigatory note of\r\nthe modern district visitor. \u201cAre you a special sort of clergyman,\u201d she\r\nsaid, after a pause, and looking down her nose at him, \u201cor do you go to\r\nthe Universities?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d he said, profoundly.\r\n\r\nHe panted for a moment with unuttered replies, and then, with a scornful\r\ngesture, got up and left the cell.\r\n\r\nSo that Ann Veronica was not able to get the expert advice she certainly\r\nneeded upon her spiritual state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 4\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a day or so she thought more steadily. She found herself in a\r\nphase of violent reaction against the suffrage movement, a phase\r\ngreatly promoted by one of those unreasonable objections people of Ann\r\nVeronica\u2019s temperament take at times--to the girl in the next cell to\r\nher own. She was a large, resilient girl, with a foolish smile, a still\r\nmore foolish expression of earnestness, and a throaty contralto voice.\r\nShe was noisy and hilarious and enthusiastic, and her hair was always\r\nabominably done. In the chapel she sang with an open-lunged gusto that\r\nsilenced Ann Veronica altogether, and in the exercising-yard slouched\r\nround with carelessly dispersed feet. Ann Veronica decided that\r\n\u201choydenish ragger\u201d was the only phrase to express her. She was always\r\nbreaking rules, whispering asides, intimating signals. She became at\r\ntimes an embodiment for Ann Veronica of all that made the suffrage\r\nmovement defective and unsatisfying.\r\n\r\nShe was always initiating petty breaches of discipline. Her greatest\r\nexploit was the howling before the mid-day meal. This was an imitation\r\nof the noises made by the carnivora at the Zoological Gardens at\r\nfeeding-time; the idea was taken up by prisoner after prisoner until\r\nthe whole place was alive with barkings, yappings, roarings, pelican\r\nchatterings, and feline yowlings, interspersed with shrieks of\r\nhysterical laughter. To many in that crowded solitude it came as an\r\nextraordinary relief. It was better even than the hymn-singing. But it\r\nannoyed Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cIdiots!\u201d she said, when she heard this pandemonium, and with particular\r\nreference to this young lady with the throaty contralto next door.\r\n\u201cIntolerable idiots!...\u201d\r\n\r\nIt took some days for this phase to pass, and it left some scars and\r\nsomething like a decision. \u201cViolence won\u2019t do it,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\u201cBegin violence, and the woman goes under....\r\n\r\n\u201cBut all the rest of our case is right.... Yes.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the long, solitary days wore on, Ann Veronica found a number of\r\ndefinite attitudes and conclusions in her mind.\r\n\r\nOne of these was a classification of women into women who are and women\r\nwho are not hostile to men. \u201cThe real reason why I am out of place\r\nhere,\u201d she said, \u201cis because I like men. I can talk with them. I\u2019ve\r\nnever found them hostile. I\u2019ve got no feminine class feeling. I don\u2019t\r\nwant any laws or freedoms to protect me from a man like Mr. Capes. I\r\nknow that in my heart I would take whatever he gave....\r\n\r\n\u201cA woman wants a proper alliance with a man, a man who is better stuff\r\nthan herself. She wants that and needs it more than anything else in\r\nthe world. It may not be just, it may not be fair, but things are so. It\r\nisn\u2019t law, nor custom, nor masculine violence settled that. It is just\r\nhow things happen to be. She wants to be free--she wants to be legally\r\nand economically free, so as not to be subject to the wrong man; but\r\nonly God, who made the world, can alter things to prevent her being\r\nslave to the right one.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd if she can\u2019t have the right one?\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed such a quality of preference!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe rubbed her knuckles into her forehead. \u201cOh, but life is difficult!\u201d\r\n she groaned. \u201cWhen you loosen the tangle in one place you tie a knot in\r\nanother.... Before there is any change, any real change, I shall be\r\ndead--dead--dead and finished--two hundred years!...\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 5\r\n\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, while everything was still, the wardress heard her cry\r\nout suddenly and alarmingly, and with great and unmistakable passion,\r\n\u201cWhy in the name of goodness did I burn that twenty pounds?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 6\r\n\r\n\r\nShe sat regarding her dinner. The meat was coarse and disagreeably\r\nserved.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose some one makes a bit on the food,\u201d she said....\r\n\r\n\u201cOne has such ridiculous ideas of the wicked common people and the\r\nbeautiful machinery of order that ropes them in. And here are these\r\nplaces, full of contagion!\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course, this is the real texture of life, this is what we refined\r\nsecure people forget. We think the whole thing is straight and noble at\r\nbottom, and it isn\u2019t. We think if we just defy the friends we have and\r\ngo out into the world everything will become easy and splendid.\r\nOne doesn\u2019t realize that even the sort of civilization one has at\r\nMorningside Park is held together with difficulty. By policemen one\r\nmustn\u2019t shock.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a world for an innocent girl to walk about in. It\u2019s a world\r\nof dirt and skin diseases and parasites. It\u2019s a world in which the\r\nlaw can be a stupid pig and the police-stations dirty dens. One wants\r\nhelpers and protectors--and clean water.\r\n\r\n\u201cAm I becoming reasonable or am I being tamed?\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m simply discovering that life is many-sided and complex and\r\npuzzling. I thought one had only to take it by the throat.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t GOT a throat!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 7\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day the idea of self-sacrifice came into her head, and she made, she\r\nthought, some important moral discoveries.\r\n\r\nIt came with an extreme effect of re-discovery, a remarkable novelty.\r\n\u201cWhat have I been all this time?\u201d she asked herself, and answered, \u201cJust\r\nstark egotism, crude assertion of Ann Veronica, without a modest rag of\r\nreligion or discipline or respect for authority to cover me!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her as though she had at last found the touchstone of\r\nconduct. She perceived she had never really thought of any one but\r\nherself in all her acts and plans. Even Capes had been for her merely an\r\nexcitant to passionate love--a mere idol at whose feet one could enjoy\r\nimaginative wallowings. She had set out to get a beautiful life, a free,\r\nuntrammelled life, self-development, without counting the cost either\r\nfor herself or others.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have hurt my father,\u201d she said; \u201cI have hurt my aunt. I have hurt and\r\nsnubbed poor Teddy. I\u2019ve made no one happy. I deserve pretty much what\r\nI\u2019ve got....\r\n\r\n\u201cIf only because of the way one hurts others if one kicks loose and\r\nfree, one has to submit....\r\n\r\n\u201cBroken-in people! I suppose the world is just all egotistical children\r\nand broken-in people.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour little flag of pride must flutter down with the rest of them, Ann\r\nVeronica....\r\n\r\n\u201cCompromise--and kindness.\r\n\r\n\u201cCompromise and kindness.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are YOU that the world should lie down at your feet?\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be a decent citizen, Ann Veronica. Take your half loaf\r\nwith the others. You mustn\u2019t go clawing after a man that doesn\u2019t belong\r\nto you--that isn\u2019t even interested in you. That\u2019s one thing clear.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to take the decent reasonable way. You\u2019ve got to adjust\r\nyourself to the people God has set about you. Every one else does.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe thought more and more along that line. There was no reason why\r\nshe shouldn\u2019t be Capes\u2019 friend. He did like her, anyhow; he was always\r\npleased to be with her. There was no reason why she shouldn\u2019t be his\r\nrestrained and dignified friend. After all, that was life. Nothing was\r\ngiven away, and no one came so rich to the stall as to command all that\r\nit had to offer. Every one has to make a deal with the world.\r\n\r\nIt would be very good to be Capes\u2019 friend.\r\n\r\nShe might be able to go on with biology, possibly even work upon the\r\nsame questions that he dealt with....\r\n\r\nPerhaps her granddaughter might marry his grandson....\r\n\r\nIt grew clear to her that throughout all her wild raid for independence\r\nshe had done nothing for anybody, and many people had done things for\r\nher. She thought of her aunt and that purse that was dropped on the\r\ntable, and of many troublesome and ill-requited kindnesses; she thought\r\nof the help of the Widgetts, of Teddy\u2019s admiration; she thought, with\r\na new-born charity, of her father, of Manning\u2019s conscientious\r\nunselfishness, of Miss Miniver\u2019s devotion.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd for me it has been Pride and Pride and Pride!\r\n\r\n\u201cI am the prodigal daughter. I will arise and go to my father, and will\r\nsay unto him--\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose pride and self-assertion are sin? Sinned against heaven--Yes,\r\nI have sinned against heaven and before thee....\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor old daddy! I wonder if he\u2019ll spend much on the fatted calf?...\r\n\r\n\u201cThe wrappered life-discipline! One comes to that at last. I begin to\r\nunderstand Jane Austen and chintz covers and decency and refinement and\r\nall the rest of it. One puts gloves on one\u2019s greedy fingers. One learns\r\nto sit up...\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd somehow or other,\u201d she added, after a long interval, \u201cI must pay\r\nMr. Ramage back his forty pounds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE TWELFTH\r\n\r\nANN VERONICA PUTS THINGS IN ORDER\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 1\r\n\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica made a strenuous attempt to carry out her good resolutions.\r\nShe meditated long and carefully upon her letter to her father before\r\nshe wrote it, and gravely and deliberately again before she despatched\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cMY DEAR FATHER,\u201d she wrote,--\u201cI have been thinking hard about\r\neverything since I was sent to this prison. All these experiences have\r\ntaught me a great deal about life and realities. I see that compromise\r\nis more necessary to life than I ignorantly supposed it to be, and I\r\nhave been trying to get Lord Morley\u2019s book on that subject, but it does\r\nnot appear to be available in the prison library, and the chaplain seems\r\nto regard him as an undesirable writer.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this point she had perceived that she was drifting from her subject.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must read him when I come out. But I see very clearly that as things\r\nare a daughter is necessarily dependent on her father and bound while\r\nshe is in that position to live harmoniously with his ideals.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBit starchy,\u201d said Ann Veronica, and altered the key abruptly. Her\r\nconcluding paragraph was, on the whole, perhaps, hardly starchy enough.\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, daddy, I am sorry for all I have done to put you out. May I\r\ncome home and try to be a better daughter to you?\r\n\r\n\u201cANN VERONICA.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\n\r\nHer aunt came to meet her outside Canongate, and, being a little\r\nconfused between what was official and what was merely a rebellious\r\nslight upon our national justice, found herself involved in a triumphal\r\nprocession to the Vindicator Vegetarian Restaurant, and was specifically\r\nand personally cheered by a small, shabby crowd outside that rendezvous.\r\nThey decided quite audibly, \u201cShe\u2019s an Old Dear, anyhow. Voting wouldn\u2019t\r\ndo no \u2018arm to \u2018er.\u201d She was on the very verge of a vegetarian meal\r\nbefore she recovered her head again. Obeying some fine instinct, she had\r\ncome to the prison in a dark veil, but she had pushed this up to kiss\r\nAnn Veronica and never drawn it down again. Eggs were procured for her,\r\nand she sat out the subsequent emotions and eloquence with the dignity\r\nbecoming an injured lady of good family. The quiet encounter and\r\nhome-coming Ann Veronica and she had contemplated was entirely\r\ndisorganized by this misadventure; there were no adequate explanations,\r\nand after they had settled things at Ann Veronica\u2019s lodgings, they\r\nreached home in the early afternoon estranged and depressed, with\r\nheadaches and the trumpet voice of the indomitable Kitty Brett still\r\nringing in their ears.\r\n\r\n\u201cDreadful women, my dear!\u201d said Miss Stanley. \u201cAnd some of them quite\r\npretty and well dressed. No need to do such things. We must never\r\nlet your father know we went. Why ever did you let me get into that\r\nwagonette?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought we had to,\u201d said Ann Veronica, who had also been a little\r\nunder the compulsion of the marshals of the occasion. \u201cIt was very\r\ntiring.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will have some tea in the drawing-room as soon as ever we can--and I\r\nwill take my things off. I don\u2019t think I shall ever care for this bonnet\r\nagain. We\u2019ll have some buttered toast. Your poor cheeks are quite sunken\r\nand hollow....\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Ann Veronica found herself in her father\u2019s study that evening it\r\nseemed to her for a moment as though all the events of the past six\r\nmonths had been a dream. The big gray spaces of London, the shop-lit,\r\ngreasy, shining streets, had become very remote; the biological\r\nlaboratory with its work and emotions, the meetings and discussions,\r\nthe rides in hansoms with Ramage, were like things in a book read and\r\nclosed. The study seemed absolutely unaltered, there was still the same\r\nlamp with a little chip out of the shade, still the same gas fire, still\r\nthe same bundle of blue and white papers, it seemed, with the same pink\r\ntape about them, at the elbow of the arm-chair, still the same father.\r\nHe sat in much the same attitude, and she stood just as she had stood\r\nwhen he told her she could not go to the Fadden Dance. Both had dropped\r\nthe rather elaborate politeness of the dining-room, and in their faces\r\nan impartial observer would have discovered little lines of obstinate\r\nwilfulness in common; a certain hardness--sharp, indeed, in the father\r\nand softly rounded in the daughter--but hardness nevertheless, that made\r\nevery compromise a bargain and every charity a discount.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so you have been thinking?\u201d her father began, quoting her letter\r\nand looking over his slanting glasses at her. \u201cWell, my girl, I wish you\r\nhad thought about all these things before these bothers began.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica perceived that she must not forget to remain eminently\r\nreasonable.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne has to live and learn,\u201d she remarked, with a passable imitation of\r\nher father\u2019s manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo long as you learn,\u201d said Mr. Stanley.\r\n\r\nTheir conversation hung.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose, daddy, you\u2019ve no objection to my going on with my work at\r\nthe Imperial College?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf it will keep you busy,\u201d he said, with a faintly ironical smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe fees are paid to the end of the session.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe nodded twice, with his eyes on the fire, as though that was a formal\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may go on with that work,\u201d he said, \u201cso long as you keep in harmony\r\nwith things at home. I\u2019m convinced that much of Russell\u2019s investigations\r\nare on wrong lines, unsound lines. Still--you must learn for yourself.\r\nYou\u2019re of age--you\u2019re of age.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe work\u2019s almost essential for the B.Sc. exam.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s scandalous, but I suppose it is.\u201d\r\n\r\nTheir agreement so far seemed remarkable, and yet as a home-coming the\r\nthing was a little lacking in warmth. But Ann Veronica had still to get\r\nto her chief topic. They were silent for a time. \u201cIt\u2019s a period of crude\r\nviews and crude work,\u201d said Mr. Stanley. \u201cStill, these Mendelian fellows\r\nseem likely to give Mr. Russell trouble, a good lot of trouble. Some of\r\ntheir specimens--wonderfully selected, wonderfully got up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDaddy,\u201d said Ann Veronica, \u201cthese affairs--being away from home\r\nhas--cost money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you would find that out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, I happen to have got a little into debt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNEVER!\u201d\r\n\r\nHer heart sank at the change in his expression.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, lodgings and things! And I paid my fees at the College.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. But how could you get--Who gave you credit?\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d said Ann Veronica, \u201cmy landlady kept on my room while I\r\nwas in Holloway, and the fees for the College mounted up pretty\r\nconsiderably.\u201d She spoke rather quickly, because she found her father\u2019s\r\nquestion the most awkward she had ever had to answer in her life.\r\n\r\n\u201cMolly and you settled about the rooms. She said you HAD some money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI borrowed it,\u201d said Ann Veronica in a casual tone, with white despair\r\nin her heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut who could have lent you money?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI pawned my pearl necklace. I got three pounds, and there\u2019s three on my\r\nwatch.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSix pounds. H\u2019m. Got the tickets? Yes, but then--you said you\r\nborrowed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did, too,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho from?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe met his eye for a second and her heart failed her. The truth\r\nwas impossible, indecent. If she mentioned Ramage he might have a\r\nfit--anything might happen. She lied. \u201cThe Widgetts,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cTut, tut!\u201d he said. \u201cReally, Vee, you seem to have advertised our\r\nrelations pretty generally!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey--they knew, of course. Because of the Dance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow much do you owe them?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe knew forty pounds was a quite impossible sum for their neighbors.\r\nShe knew, too, she must not hesitate. \u201cEight pounds,\u201d she plunged, and\r\nadded foolishly, \u201cfifteen pounds will see me clear of everything.\u201d She\r\nmuttered some unlady-like comment upon herself under her breath and\r\nengaged in secret additions.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanley determined to improve the occasion. He seemed to deliberate.\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said at last slowly, \u201cI\u2019ll pay it. I\u2019ll pay it. But I do\r\nhope, Vee, I do hope--this is the end of these adventures. I hope you\r\nhave learned your lesson now and come to see--come to realize--how\r\nthings are. People, nobody, can do as they like in this world.\r\nEverywhere there are limitations.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Ann Veronica (fifteen pounds!). \u201cI have learned that. I\r\nmean--I mean to do what I can.\u201d (Fifteen pounds. Fifteen from forty is\r\ntwenty-five.)\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. She could think of nothing more to say.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d she achieved at last. \u201cHere goes for the new life!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere goes for the new life,\u201d he echoed and stood up. Father and\r\ndaughter regarded each other warily, each more than a little insecure\r\nwith the other. He made a movement toward her, and then recalled the\r\ncircumstances of their last conversation in that study. She saw his\r\npurpose and his doubt hesitated also, and then went to him, took his\r\ncoat lapels, and kissed him on the cheek.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, Vee,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s better! and kissed her back rather clumsily.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be sensible.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe disengaged herself from him and went out of the room with a grave,\r\npreoccupied expression. (Fifteen pounds! And she wanted forty!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 4\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was, perhaps, the natural consequence of a long and tiring and\r\nexciting day that Ann Veronica should pass a broken and distressful\r\nnight, a night in which the noble and self-subduing resolutions of\r\nCanongate displayed themselves for the first time in an atmosphere of\r\nalmost lurid dismay. Her father\u2019s peculiar stiffness of soul presented\r\nitself now as something altogether left out of the calculations upon\r\nwhich her plans were based, and, in particular, she had not anticipated\r\nthe difficulty she would find in borrowing the forty pounds she needed\r\nfor Ramage. That had taken her by surprise, and her tired wits had\r\nfailed her. She was to have fifteen pounds, and no more. She knew that\r\nto expect more now was like anticipating a gold-mine in the garden. The\r\nchance had gone. It became suddenly glaringly apparent to her that it\r\nwas impossible to return fifteen pounds or any sum less than twenty\r\npounds to Ramage--absolutely impossible. She realized that with a pang\r\nof disgust and horror.\r\n\r\nAlready she had sent him twenty pounds, and never written to explain to\r\nhim why it was she had not sent it back sharply directly he returned\r\nit. She ought to have written at once and told him exactly what had\r\nhappened. Now if she sent fifteen pounds the suggestion that she had\r\nspent a five-pound note in the meanwhile would be irresistible. No! That\r\nwas impossible. She would have just to keep the fifteen pounds until she\r\ncould make it twenty. That might happen on her birthday--in August.\r\n\r\nShe turned about, and was persecuted by visions, half memories,\r\nhalf dreams, of Ramage. He became ugly and monstrous, dunning her,\r\nthreatening her, assailing her.\r\n\r\n\u201cConfound sex from first to last!\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we\r\npropagate by sexless spores, as the ferns do? We restrict each other, we\r\nbadger each other, friendship is poisoned and buried under it!... I\r\nMUST pay off that forty pounds. I MUST.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a time there seemed no comfort for her even in Capes. She was to see\r\nCapes to-morrow, but now, in this state of misery she had achieved, she\r\nfelt assured he would turn his back upon her, take no notice of her at\r\nall. And if he didn\u2019t, what was the good of seeing him?\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish he was a woman,\u201d she said, \u201cthen I could make him my friend. I\r\nwant him as my friend. I want to talk to him and go about with him. Just\r\ngo about with him.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a time, with her nose on the pillow, and that brought\r\nher to: \u201cWhat\u2019s the good of pretending?\r\n\r\n\u201cI love him,\u201d she said aloud to the dim forms of her room, and repeated\r\nit, and went on to imagine herself doing acts of tragically dog-like\r\ndevotion to the biologist, who, for the purposes of the drama, remained\r\nentirely unconscious of and indifferent to her proceedings.\r\n\r\nAt last some anodyne formed itself from these exercises,\r\nand, with eyelashes wet with such feeble tears as only\r\nthree-o\u2019clock-in-the-morning pathos can distil, she fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 5\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to some altogether private calculations she did not go up to\r\nthe Imperial College until after mid-day, and she found the laboratory\r\ndeserted, even as she desired. She went to the table under the end\r\nwindow at which she had been accustomed to work, and found it swept and\r\ngarnished with full bottles of re-agents. Everything was very neat; it\r\nhad evidently been straightened up and kept for her. She put down the\r\nsketch-books and apparatus she had brought with her, pulled out her\r\nstool, and sat down. As she did so the preparation-room door opened\r\nbehind her. She heard it open, but as she felt unable to look round in\r\na careless manner she pretended not to hear it. Then Capes\u2019 footsteps\r\napproached. She turned with an effort.\r\n\r\n\u201cI expected you this morning,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw--they knocked off your\r\nfetters yesterday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it is very good of me to come this afternoon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI began to be afraid you might not come at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAfraid!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re back for all sorts of reasons.\u201d He spoke a little\r\nnervously. \u201cAmong other things, you know, I didn\u2019t understand quite--I\r\ndidn\u2019t understand that you were so keenly interested in this suffrage\r\nquestion. I have it on my conscience that I offended you--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOffended me when?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been haunted by the memory of you. I was rude and stupid. We were\r\ntalking about the suffrage--and I rather scoffed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t rude,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were so keen on this suffrage business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor I. You haven\u2019t had it on your mind all this time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have rather. I felt somehow I\u2019d hurt you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t. I--I hurt myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI mean--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI behaved like an idiot, that\u2019s all. My nerves were in rags. I was\r\nworried. We\u2019re the hysterical animal, Mr. Capes. I got myself locked up\r\nto cool off. By a sort of instinct. As a dog eats grass. I\u2019m right again\r\nnow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause your nerves were exposed, that was no excuse for my touching\r\nthem. I ought to have seen--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter a rap--if you\u2019re not disposed to resent the--the way\r\nI behaved.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_I_ resent!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was only sorry I\u2019d been so stupid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I take it we\u2019re straight again,\u201d said Capes with a note of\r\nrelief, and assumed an easier position on the edge of her table. \u201cBut\r\nif you weren\u2019t keen on the suffrage business, why on earth did you go to\r\nprison?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica reflected. \u201cIt was a phase,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\nHe smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a new phase in the life history,\u201d he remarked.\r\n\u201cEverybody seems to have it now. Everybody who\u2019s going to develop into a\r\nwoman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s Miss Garvice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s coming on,\u201d said Capes. \u201cAnd, you know, you\u2019re altering us all.\r\nI\u2019M shaken. The campaign\u2019s a success.\u201d He met her questioning eye, and\r\nrepeated, \u201cOh! it IS a success. A man is so apt to--to take women a\r\nlittle too lightly. Unless they remind him now and then not to....\r\nYOU did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I didn\u2019t waste my time in prison altogether?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the prison impressed me. But I liked the things you said\r\nhere. I felt suddenly I understood you--as an intelligent person. If\r\nyou\u2019ll forgive my saying that, and implying what goes with it. There\u2019s\r\nsomething--puppyish in a man\u2019s usual attitude to women. That is what\r\nI\u2019ve had on my conscience.... I don\u2019t think we\u2019re altogether to blame\r\nif we don\u2019t take some of your lot seriously. Some of your sex, I mean.\r\nBut we smirk a little, I\u2019m afraid, habitually when we talk to you. We\r\nsmirk, and we\u2019re a bit--furtive.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe paused, with his eyes studying her gravely. \u201cYou, anyhow, don\u2019t\r\ndeserve it,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nTheir colloquy was ended abruptly by the apparition of Miss Klegg at\r\nthe further door. When she saw Ann Veronica she stood for a moment as if\r\nentranced, and then advanced with outstretched hands. \u201cVeronique!\u201d she\r\ncried with a rising intonation, though never before had she called Ann\r\nVeronica anything but Miss Stanley, and seized her and squeezed her and\r\nkissed her with profound emotion. \u201cTo think that you were going to do\r\nit--and never said a word! You are a little thin, but except for that\r\nyou look--you look better than ever. Was it VERY horrible? I tried to\r\nget into the police-court, but the crowd was ever so much too big, push\r\nas I would....\r\n\r\n\u201cI mean to go to prison directly the session is over,\u201d said Miss Klegg.\r\n\u201cWild horses--not if they have all the mounted police in London--shan\u2019t\r\nkeep me out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 6\r\n\r\n\r\nCapes lit things wonderfully for Ann Veronica all that afternoon, he was\r\nso friendly, so palpably interested in her, and glad to have her back\r\nwith him. Tea in the laboratory was a sort of suffragette reception.\r\nMiss Garvice assumed a quality of neutrality, professed herself almost\r\nwon over by Ann Veronica\u2019s example, and the Scotchman decided that if\r\nwomen had a distinctive sphere it was, at any rate, an enlarging sphere,\r\nand no one who believed in the doctrine of evolution could logically\r\ndeny the vote to women \u201cultimately,\u201d however much they might be disposed\r\nto doubt the advisability of its immediate concession. It was a refusal\r\nof expediency, he said, and not an absolute refusal. The youth with his\r\nhair like Russell cleared his throat and said rather irrelevantly that\r\nhe knew a man who knew Thomas Bayard Simmons, who had rioted in the\r\nStrangers\u2019 Gallery, and then Capes, finding them all distinctly pro-Ann\r\nVeronica, if not pro-feminist, ventured to be perverse, and started a\r\nvein of speculation upon the Scotchman\u2019s idea--that there were still\r\nhopes of women evolving into something higher.\r\n\r\nHe was unusually absurd and ready, and all the time it seemed to Ann\r\nVeronica as a delightful possibility, as a thing not indeed to be\r\nentertained seriously, but to be half furtively felt, that he was being\r\nso agreeable because she had come back again. She returned home through\r\na world that was as roseate as it had been gray overnight.\r\n\r\nBut as she got out of the train at Morningside Park Station she had a\r\nshock. She saw, twenty yards down the platform, the shiny hat and broad\r\nback and inimitable swagger of Ramage. She dived at once behind the\r\ncover of the lamp-room and affected serious trouble with her shoe-lace\r\nuntil he was out of the station, and then she followed slowly and with\r\nextreme discretion until the bifurcation of the Avenue from the field\r\nway insured her escape. Ramage went up the Avenue, and she hurried\r\nalong the path with a beating heart and a disagreeable sense of unsolved\r\nproblems in her mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat thing\u2019s going on,\u201d she told herself. \u201cEverything goes on, confound\r\nit! One doesn\u2019t change anything one has set going by making good\r\nresolutions.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd then ahead of her she saw the radiant and welcoming figure of\r\nManning. He came as an agreeable diversion from an insoluble perplexity.\r\nShe smiled at the sight of him, and thereat his radiation increased.\r\n\r\n\u201cI missed the hour of your release,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I was at the\r\nVindicator Restaurant. You did not see me, I know. I was among the\r\ncommon herd in the place below, but I took good care to see you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course you\u2019re converted?\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the view that all those Splendid Women in the movement ought to have\r\nvotes. Rather! Who could help it?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe towered up over her and smiled down at her in his fatherly way.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the view that all women ought to have votes whether they like it or\r\nnot.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, and his eyes and the mouth under the black mustache\r\nwrinkled with his smile. And as he walked by her side they began a\r\nwrangle that was none the less pleasant to Ann Veronica because it\r\nserved to banish a disagreeable preoccupation. It seemed to her in her\r\nrestored geniality that she liked Manning extremely. The brightness\r\nCapes had diffused over the world glorified even his rival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 7\r\n\r\n\r\nThe steps by which Ann Veronica determined to engage herself to marry\r\nManning were never very clear to her. A medley of motives warred in her,\r\nand it was certainly not one of the least of these that she knew herself\r\nto be passionately in love with Capes; at moments she had a giddy\r\nintimation that he was beginning to feel keenly interested in her.\r\nShe realized more and more the quality of the brink upon which she\r\nstood--the dreadful readiness with which in certain moods she\r\nmight plunge, the unmitigated wrongness and recklessness of such a\r\nself-abandonment. \u201cHe must never know,\u201d she would whisper to herself,\r\n\u201che must never know. Or else--Else it will be impossible that I can be\r\nhis friend.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat simple statement of the case was by no means all that went on in\r\nAnn Veronica\u2019s mind. But it was the form of her ruling determination; it\r\nwas the only form that she ever allowed to see daylight. What else was\r\nthere lurked in shadows and deep places; if in some mood of reverie it\r\ncame out into the light, it was presently overwhelmed and hustled back\r\nagain into hiding. She would never look squarely at these dream forms\r\nthat mocked the social order in which she lived, never admit she\r\nlistened to the soft whisperings in her ear. But Manning seemed more and\r\nmore clearly indicated as a refuge, as security. Certain simple purposes\r\nemerged from the disingenuous muddle of her feelings and desires. Seeing\r\nCapes from day to day made a bright eventfulness that hampered her in\r\nthe course she had resolved to follow. She vanished from the laboratory\r\nfor a week, a week of oddly interesting days....\r\n\r\nWhen she renewed her attendance at the Imperial College the third finger\r\nof her left hand was adorned with a very fine old ring with dark blue\r\nsapphires that had once belonged to a great-aunt of Manning\u2019s.\r\n\r\nThat ring manifestly occupied her thoughts a great deal. She kept\r\npausing in her work and regarding it, and when Capes came round to her,\r\nshe first put her hand in her lap and then rather awkwardly in front of\r\nhim. But men are often blind to rings. He seemed to be.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon she had considered certain doubts very carefully,\r\nand decided on a more emphatic course of action. \u201cAre these ordinary\r\nsapphires?\u201d she said. He bent to her hand, and she slipped off the ring\r\nand gave it to him to examine.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good,\u201d he said. \u201cRather darker than most of them. But I\u2019m\r\ngenerously ignorant of gems. Is it an old ring?\u201d he asked, returning it.\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe it is. It\u2019s an engagement ring....\u201d She slipped it on her\r\nfinger, and added, in a voice she tried to make matter-of-fact: \u201cIt was\r\ngiven to me last week.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d he said, in a colorless tone, and with his eyes on her face.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Last week.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe glanced at him, and it was suddenly apparent for one instant of\r\nillumination that this ring upon her finger was the crowning blunder\r\nof her life. It was apparent, and then it faded into the quality of an\r\ninevitable necessity.\r\n\r\n\u201cOdd!\u201d he remarked, rather surprisingly, after a little interval.\r\n\r\nThere was a brief pause, a crowded pause, between them.\r\n\r\nShe sat very still, and his eyes rested on that ornament for a moment,\r\nand then travelled slowly to her wrist and the soft lines of her\r\nforearm.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose I ought to congratulate you,\u201d he said. Their eyes met, and\r\nhis expressed perplexity and curiosity. \u201cThe fact is--I don\u2019t know\r\nwhy--this takes me by surprise. Somehow I haven\u2019t connected the idea\r\nwith you. You seemed complete--without that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid I?\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why. But this is like--like walking round a house that\r\nlooks square and complete and finding an unexpected long wing running\r\nout behind.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him, and found he was watching her closely. For some\r\nseconds of voluminous thinking they looked at the ring between them,\r\nand neither spoke. Then Capes shifted his eyes to her microscope and\r\nthe little trays of unmounted sections beside it. \u201cHow is that carmine\r\nworking?\u201d he asked, with a forced interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cBetter,\u201d said Ann Veronica, with an unreal alacrity. \u201cBut it still\r\nmisses the nucleolus.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH\r\n\r\nTHE SAPPHIRE RING\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 1\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a time that ring set with sapphires seemed to be, after all, the\r\nsatisfactory solution of Ann Veronica\u2019s difficulties. It was like\r\npouring a strong acid over dulled metal. A tarnish of constraint that\r\nhad recently spread over her intercourse with Capes vanished again. They\r\nembarked upon an open and declared friendship. They even talked about\r\nfriendship. They went to the Zoological Gardens together one Saturday to\r\nsee for themselves a point of morphological interest about the toucan\u2019s\r\nbill--that friendly and entertaining bird--and they spent the rest of\r\nthe afternoon walking about and elaborating in general terms this theme\r\nand the superiority of intellectual fellowship to all merely passionate\r\nrelationships. Upon this topic Capes was heavy and conscientious, but\r\nthat seemed to her to be just exactly what he ought to be. He was also,\r\nhad she known it, more than a little insincere. \u201cWe are only in the dawn\r\nof the Age of Friendship,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen interest, I suppose, will\r\ntake the place of passions. Either you have had to love people or hate\r\nthem--which is a sort of love, too, in its way--to get anything out of\r\nthem. Now, more and more, we\u2019re going to be interested in them, to be\r\ncurious about them and--quite mildly-experimental with them.\u201d He seemed\r\nto be elaborating ideas as he talked. They watched the chimpanzees in\r\nthe new apes\u2019 house, and admired the gentle humanity of their eyes--\u201cso\r\nmuch more human than human beings\u201d--and they watched the Agile Gibbon in\r\nthe next apartment doing wonderful leaps and aerial somersaults.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder which of us enjoys that most,\u201d said Capes--\u201cdoes he, or do\r\nwe?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe seems to get a zest--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe does it and forgets it. We remember it. These joyful bounds just\r\nlace into the stuff of my memories and stay there forever. Living\u2019s just\r\nmaterial.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very good to be alive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to know life than be life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne may do both,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\nShe was in a very uncritical state that afternoon. When he said, \u201cLet\u2019s\r\ngo and see the wart-hog,\u201d she thought no one ever had had so quick a\r\nflow of good ideas as he; and when he explained that sugar and not buns\r\nwas the talisman of popularity among the animals, she marvelled at his\r\npractical omniscience.\r\n\r\nFinally, at the exit into Regent\u2019s Park, they ran against Miss Klegg.\r\nIt was the expression of Miss Klegg\u2019s face that put the idea into Ann\r\nVeronica\u2019s head of showing Manning at the College one day, an idea which\r\nshe didn\u2019t for some reason or other carry out for a fortnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen at last she did so, the sapphire ring took on a new quality in the\r\nimagination of Capes. It ceased to be the symbol of liberty and a remote\r\nand quite abstracted person, and became suddenly and very disagreeably\r\nthe token of a large and portentous body visible and tangible.\r\n\r\nManning appeared just at the end of the afternoon\u2019s work, and the\r\nbiologist was going through some perplexities the Scotchman had created\r\nby a metaphysical treatment of the skulls of Hyrax and a young African\r\nelephant. He was clearing up these difficulties by tracing a partially\r\nobliterated suture the Scotchman had overlooked when the door from the\r\npassage opened, and Manning came into his universe.\r\n\r\nSeen down the length of the laboratory, Manning looked a very handsome\r\nand shapely gentleman indeed, and, at the sight of his eager advance to\r\nhis fiancee, Miss Klegg replaced one long-cherished romance about Ann\r\nVeronica by one more normal and simple. He carried a cane and a silk\r\nhat with a mourning-band in one gray-gloved hand; his frock-coat and\r\ntrousers were admirable; his handsome face, his black mustache, his\r\nprominent brow conveyed an eager solicitude.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want,\u201d he said, with a white hand outstretched, \u201cto take you out to\r\ntea.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been clearing up,\u201d said Ann Veronica, brightly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll your dreadful scientific things?\u201d he said, with a smile that Miss\r\nKlegg thought extraordinarily kindly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll my dreadful scientific things,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\nHe stood back, smiling with an air of proprietorship, and looking about\r\nhim at the business-like equipment of the room. The low ceiling made him\r\nseem abnormally tall. Ann Veronica wiped a scalpel, put a card over a\r\nwatch-glass containing thin shreds of embryonic guinea-pig swimming in\r\nmauve stain, and dismantled her microscope.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish I understood more of biology,\u201d said Manning.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d said Ann Veronica, closing her microscope-box with a click,\r\nand looking for one brief instant up the laboratory. \u201cWe have no airs\r\nand graces here, and my hat hangs from a peg in the passage.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe led the way to the door, and Manning passed behind her and round her\r\nand opened the door for her. When Capes glanced up at them for a moment,\r\nManning seemed to be holding his arms all about her, and there was\r\nnothing but quiet acquiescence in her bearing.\r\n\r\nAfter Capes had finished the Scotchman\u2019s troubles he went back into the\r\npreparation-room. He sat down on the sill of the open window, folded his\r\narms, and stared straight before him for a long time over the wilderness\r\nof tiles and chimney-pots into a sky that was blue and empty. He was not\r\naddicted to monologue, and the only audible comment he permitted himself\r\nat first upon a universe that was evidently anything but satisfactory to\r\nhim that afternoon, was one compact and entirely unassigned \u201cDamn!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe word must have had some gratifying quality, because he repeated\r\nit. Then he stood up and repeated it again. \u201cThe fool I have been!\u201d he\r\ncried; and now speech was coming to him. He tried this sentence with\r\nexpletives. \u201cAss!\u201d he went on, still warming. \u201cMuck-headed moral ass! I\r\nought to have done anything.\r\n\r\n\u201cI ought to have done anything!\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a man for?\r\n\r\n\u201cFriendship!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe doubled up his fist, and seemed to contemplate thrusting it through\r\nthe window. He turned his back on that temptation. Then suddenly he\r\nseized a new preparation bottle that stood upon his table and contained\r\nthe better part of a week\u2019s work--a displayed dissection of a snail,\r\nbeautifully done--and hurled it across the room, to smash resoundingly\r\nupon the cemented floor under the bookcase; then, without either haste\r\nor pause, he swept his arm along a shelf of re-agents and sent them to\r\nmingle with the debris on the floor. They fell in a diapason of smashes.\r\n\u201cH\u2019m!\u201d he said, regarding the wreckage with a calmer visage. \u201cSilly!\u201d he\r\nremarked after a pause. \u201cOne hardly knows--all the time.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe put his hands in his pockets, his mouth puckered to a whistle, and he\r\nwent to the door of the outer preparation-room and stood there, looking,\r\nsave for the faintest intensification of his natural ruddiness, the\r\nembodiment of blond serenity.\r\n\r\n\u201cGellett,\u201d he called, \u201cjust come and clear up a mess, will you? I\u2019ve\r\nsmashed some things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was one serious flaw in Ann Veronica\u2019s arrangements for\r\nself-rehabilitation, and that was Ramage. He hung over her--he and his\r\nloan to her and his connection with her and that terrible evening--a\r\nvague, disconcerting possibility of annoyance and exposure. She could\r\nnot see any relief from this anxiety except repayment, and repayment\r\nseemed impossible. The raising of twenty-five pounds was a task\r\naltogether beyond her powers. Her birthday was four months away, and\r\nthat, at its extremist point, might give her another five pounds.\r\n\r\nThe thing rankled in her mind night and day. She would wake in the night\r\nto repeat her bitter cry: \u201cOh, why did I burn those notes?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt added greatly to the annoyance of the situation that she had twice\r\nseen Ramage in the Avenue since her return to the shelter of her\r\nfather\u2019s roof. He had saluted her with elaborate civility, his eyes\r\ndistended with indecipherable meanings.\r\n\r\nShe felt she was bound in honor to tell the whole affair to Manning\r\nsooner or later. Indeed, it seemed inevitable that she must clear it up\r\nwith his assistance, or not at all. And when Manning was not about\r\nthe thing seemed simple enough. She would compose extremely lucid and\r\nhonorable explanations. But when it came to broaching them, it proved to\r\nbe much more difficult than she had supposed.\r\n\r\nThey went down the great staircase of the building, and, while she\r\nsought in her mind for a beginning, he broke into appreciation of her\r\nsimple dress and self-congratulations upon their engagement.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt makes me feel,\u201d he said, \u201cthat nothing is impossible--to have you\r\nhere beside me. I said, that day at Surbiton, \u2018There\u2019s many good things\r\nin life, but there\u2019s only one best, and that\u2019s the wild-haired girl\r\nwho\u2019s pulling away at that oar. I will make her my Grail, and some day,\r\nperhaps, if God wills, she shall become my wife!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked very hard before him as he said this, and his voice was full\r\nof deep feeling.\r\n\r\n\u201cGrail!\u201d said Ann Veronica, and then: \u201cOh, yes--of course! Anything but\r\na holy one, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAltogether holy, Ann Veronica. Ah! but you can\u2019t imagine what you are\r\nto me and what you mean to me! I suppose there is something mystical and\r\nwonderful about all women.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is something mystical and wonderful about all human beings. I\r\ndon\u2019t see that men need bank it with the women.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA man does,\u201d said Manning--\u201ca true man, anyhow. And for me there is\r\nonly one treasure-house. By Jove! When I think of it I want to leap and\r\nshout!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would astonish that man with the barrow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt astonishes me that I don\u2019t,\u201d said Manning, in a tone of intense\r\nself-enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think,\u201d began Ann Veronica, \u201cthat you don\u2019t realize--\u201d\r\n\r\nHe disregarded her entirely. He waved an arm and spoke with a peculiar\r\nresonance. \u201cI feel like a giant! I believe now I shall do great things.\r\nGods! what it must be to pour out strong, splendid verse--mighty\r\nlines! mighty lines! If I do, Ann Veronica, it will be you. It will be\r\naltogether you. I will dedicate my books to you. I will lay them all at\r\nyour feet.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe beamed upon her.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you realize,\u201d Ann Veronica began again, \u201cthat I am rather\r\na defective human being.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d said Manning. \u201cThey say there are spots on the sun.\r\nNot for me. It warms me, and lights me, and fills my world with flowers.\r\nWhy should I peep at it through smoked glass to see things that don\u2019t\r\naffect me?\u201d He smiled his delight at his companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got bad faults.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head slowly, smiling mysteriously.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut perhaps I want to confess them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI grant you absolution.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want absolution. I want to make myself visible to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish I could make you visible to yourself. I don\u2019t believe in the\r\nfaults. They\u2019re just a joyous softening of the outline--more beautiful\r\nthan perfection. Like the flaws of an old marble. If you talk of your\r\nfaults, I shall talk of your splendors.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do want to tell you things, nevertheless.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have, thank God! ten myriad days to tell each other things. When\r\nI think of it--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut these are things I want to tell you now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI made a little song of it. Let me say it to you. I\u2019ve no name for it\r\nyet. Epithalamy might do.\r\n\r\n     \u201cLike him who stood on Darien\r\n     I view uncharted sea\r\n     Ten thousand days, ten thousand nights\r\n     Before my Queen and me.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that only brings me up to about sixty-five!\r\n\r\n     \u201cA glittering wilderness of time\r\n     That to the sunset reaches\r\n     No keel as yet its waves has ploughed\r\n     Or gritted on its beaches.\r\n\r\n     \u201cAnd we will sail that splendor wide,\r\n     From day to day together,\r\n     From isle to isle of happiness\r\n     Through year\u2019s of God\u2019s own weather.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said his prospective fellow-sailor, \u201cthat\u2019s very pretty.\u201d She\r\nstopped short, full of things un-said. Pretty! Ten thousand days, ten\r\nthousand nights!\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shall tell me your faults,\u201d said Manning. \u201cIf they matter to you,\r\nthey matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t precisely faults,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\r\nbothers me.\u201d Ten thousand! Put that way it seemed so different.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen assuredly!\u201d said Manning.\r\n\r\nShe found a little difficulty in beginning. She was glad when he went\r\non: \u201cI want to be your city of refuge from every sort of bother. I want\r\nto stand between you and all the force and vileness of the world. I want\r\nto make you feel that here is a place where the crowd does not clamor\r\nnor ill-winds blow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is all very well,\u201d said Ann Veronica, unheeded.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is my dream of you,\u201d said Manning, warming. \u201cI want my life to be\r\nbeaten gold just in order to make it a fitting setting for yours. There\r\nyou will be, in an inner temple. I want to enrich it with hangings and\r\ngladden it with verses. I want to fill it with fine and precious things.\r\nAnd by degrees, perhaps, that maiden distrust of yours that makes you\r\nshrink from my kisses, will vanish.... Forgive me if a certain\r\nwarmth creeps into my words! The Park is green and gray to-day, but I am\r\nglowing pink and gold.... It is difficult to express these things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 4\r\n\r\n\r\nThey sat with tea and strawberries and cream before them at a little\r\ntable in front of the pavilion in Regent\u2019s Park. Her confession was\r\nstill unmade. Manning leaned forward on the table, talking discursively\r\non the probable brilliance of their married life. Ann Veronica sat back\r\nin an attitude of inattention, her eyes on a distant game of cricket,\r\nher mind perplexed and busy. She was recalling the circumstances under\r\nwhich she had engaged herself to Manning, and trying to understand a\r\ncurious development of the quality of this relationship.\r\n\r\nThe particulars of her engagement were very clear in her memory. She had\r\ntaken care he should have this momentous talk with her on a garden-seat\r\ncommanded by the windows of the house. They had been playing tennis,\r\nwith his manifest intention looming over her.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us sit down for a moment,\u201d he had said. He made his speech a little\r\nelaborately. She plucked at the knots of her racket and heard him to the\r\nend, then spoke in a restrained undertone.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou ask me to be engaged to you, Mr. Manning,\u201d she began.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to lay all my life at your feet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Manning, I do not think I love you.... I want to be very plain\r\nwith you. I have nothing, nothing that can possibly be passion for you.\r\nI am sure. Nothing at all.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was silent for some moments.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps that is only sleeping,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think--perhaps I am rather a cold-blooded person.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stopped. He remained listening attentively.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have been very kind to me,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would give my life for you.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer heart had warmed toward him. It had seemed to her that life might\r\nbe very good indeed with his kindliness and sacrifice about her. She\r\nthought of him as always courteous and helpful, as realizing, indeed,\r\nhis ideal of protection and service, as chivalrously leaving her free to\r\nlive her own life, rejoicing with an infinite generosity in every detail\r\nof her irresponsive being. She twanged the catgut under her fingers.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems so unfair,\u201d she said, \u201cto take all you offer me and give so\r\nlittle in return.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is all the world to me. And we are not traders looking at\r\nequivalents.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know, Mr. Manning, I do not really want to marry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems so--so unworthy\u201d--she picked among her phrases \u201cof the noble\r\nlove you give--\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stopped, through the difficulty she found in expressing herself.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I am judge of that,\u201d said Manning.\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you wait for me?\u201d\r\n\r\nManning was silent for a space. \u201cAs my lady wills.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you let me go on studying for a time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you order patience.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think, Mr. Manning... I do not know. It is so difficult. When I\r\nthink of the love you give me--One ought to give you back love.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou like me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. And I am grateful to you....\u201d\r\n\r\nManning tapped with his racket on the turf through some moments of\r\nsilence. \u201cYou are the most perfect, the most glorious of created\r\nthings--tender, frank intellectual, brave, beautiful. I am your\r\nservitor. I am ready to wait for you, to wait your pleasure, to give all\r\nmy life to winning it. Let me only wear your livery. Give me but leave\r\nto try. You want to think for a time, to be free for a time. That is so\r\nlike you, Diana--Pallas Athene! (Pallas Athene is better.) You are all\r\nthe slender goddesses. I understand. Let me engage myself. That is all I\r\nask.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him; his face, downcast and in profile, was handsome and\r\nstrong. Her gratitude swelled within her.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are too good for me,\u201d she said in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you--you will?\u201d\r\n\r\nA long pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t fair....\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut will you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYES.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor some seconds he had remained quite still.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I sit here,\u201d he said, standing up before her abruptly, \u201cI shall\r\nhave to shout. Let us walk about. Tum, tum, tirray, tum, tum, tum,\r\nte-tum--that thing of Mendelssohn\u2019s! If making one human being\r\nabsolutely happy is any satisfaction to you--\u201d\r\n\r\nHe held out his hands, and she also stood up.\r\n\r\nHe drew her close up to him with a strong, steady pull. Then suddenly,\r\nin front of all those windows, he folded her in his arms and pressed her\r\nto him, and kissed her unresisting face.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d cried Ann Veronica, struggling faintly, and he released her.\r\n\r\n\u201cForgive me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am at singing-pitch.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe had a moment of sheer panic at the thing she had done. \u201cMr.\r\nManning,\u201d she said, \u201cfor a time--Will you tell no one? Will you keep\r\nthis--our secret? I\u2019m doubtful--Will you please not even tell my aunt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you will,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if my manner tells! I cannot help it if\r\nthat shows. You only mean a secret for a little time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust for a little time,\u201d she said; \u201cyes....\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the ring, and her aunt\u2019s triumphant eye, and a note of approval in\r\nher father\u2019s manner, and a novel disposition in him to praise Manning\r\nin a just, impartial voice had soon placed very definite qualifications\r\nupon that covenanted secrecy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 5\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first the quality of her relationship to Manning seemed moving and\r\nbeautiful to Ann Veronica. She admired and rather pitied him, and she\r\nwas unfeignedly grateful to him. She even thought that perhaps she might\r\ncome to love him, in spite of that faint indefinable flavor of absurdity\r\nthat pervaded his courtly bearing. She would never love him as she\r\nloved Capes, of course, but there are grades and qualities of love.\r\nFor Manning it would be a more temperate love altogether. Much more\r\ntemperate; the discreet and joyless love of a virtuous, reluctant,\r\ncondescending wife. She had been quite convinced that an engagement with\r\nhim and at last a marriage had exactly that quality of compromise which\r\ndistinguishes the ways of the wise. It would be the wrappered world\r\nalmost at its best. She saw herself building up a life upon that--a\r\nlife restrained, kindly, beautiful, a little pathetic and altogether\r\ndignified; a life of great disciplines and suppressions and extensive\r\nreserves...\r\n\r\nBut the Ramage affair needed clearing up, of course; it was a flaw upon\r\nthat project. She had to explain about and pay off that forty pounds....\r\n\r\nThen, quite insensibly, her queenliness had declined. She was never able\r\nto trace the changes her attitude had undergone, from the time when she\r\nbelieved herself to be the pampered Queen of Fortune, the crown of a\r\ngood man\u2019s love (and secretly, but nobly, worshipping some one else),\r\nto the time when she realized she was in fact just a mannequin for her\r\nlover\u2019s imagination, and that he cared no more for the realities of her\r\nbeing, for the things she felt and desired, for the passions and dreams\r\nthat might move her, than a child cares for the sawdust in its doll. She\r\nwas the actress his whim had chosen to play a passive part....\r\n\r\nIt was one of the most educational disillusionments in Ann Veronica\u2019s\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nBut did many women get anything better?\r\n\r\nThis afternoon, when she was urgent to explain her hampering and\r\ntainting complication with Ramage, the realization of this alien quality\r\nin her relationship with Manning became acute. Hitherto it had been\r\nqualified by her conception of all life as a compromise, by her new\r\neffort to be unexacting of life. But she perceived that to tell Manning\r\nof her Ramage adventures as they had happened would be like tarring\r\nfigures upon a water-color. They were in different key, they had a\r\ndifferent timbre. How could she tell him what indeed already began to\r\npuzzle herself, why she had borrowed that money at all? The plain fact\r\nwas that she had grabbed a bait. She had grabbed! She became less and\r\nless attentive to his meditative, self-complacent fragments of talk as\r\nshe told herself this. Her secret thoughts made some hasty, half-hearted\r\nexcursions into the possibility of telling the thing in romantic\r\ntones--Ramage was as a black villain, she as a white, fantastically\r\nwhite, maiden.... She doubted if Manning would even listen to that.\r\nHe would refuse to listen and absolve her unshriven.\r\n\r\nThen it came to her with a shock, as an extraordinary oversight, that\r\nshe could never tell Manning about Ramage--never.\r\n\r\nShe dismissed the idea of doing so. But that still left the forty\r\npounds!...\r\n\r\nHer mind went on generalizing. So it would always be between herself and\r\nManning. She saw her life before her robbed of all generous illusions,\r\nthe wrappered life unwrappered forever, vistas of dull responses, crises\r\nof make-believe, years of exacting mutual disregard in a misty garden of\r\nfine sentiments.\r\n\r\nBut did any woman get anything better from a man? Perhaps every woman\r\nconceals herself from a man perforce!...\r\n\r\nShe thought of Capes. She could not help thinking of Capes. Surely\r\nCapes was different. Capes looked at one and not over one, spoke to one,\r\ntreated one as a visible concrete fact. Capes saw her, felt for her,\r\ncared for her greatly, even if he did not love her. Anyhow, he did not\r\nsentimentalize her. And she had been doubting since that walk in the\r\nZoological Gardens whether, indeed, he did simply care for her. Little\r\nthings, almost impalpable, had happened to justify that doubt; something\r\nin his manner had belied his words. Did he not look for her in the\r\nmorning when she entered--come very quickly to her? She thought of him\r\nas she had last seen him looking down the length of the laboratory to\r\nsee her go. Why had he glanced up--quite in that way?...\r\n\r\nThe thought of Capes flooded her being like long-veiled sunlight\r\nbreaking again through clouds. It came to her like a dear thing\r\nrediscovered, that she loved Capes. It came to her that to marry any\r\none but Capes was impossible. If she could not marry him, she would not\r\nmarry any one. She would end this sham with Manning. It ought never\r\nto have begun. It was cheating, pitiful cheating. And then if some day\r\nCapes wanted her--saw fit to alter his views upon friendship....\r\n\r\nDim possibilities that she would not seem to look at even to herself\r\ngesticulated in the twilight background of her mind.\r\n\r\nShe leaped suddenly at a desperate resolution, and in one moment had\r\nmade it into a new self. She flung aside every plan she had in life,\r\nevery discretion. Of course, why not? She would be honest, anyhow!\r\n\r\nShe turned her eyes to Manning.\r\n\r\nHe was sitting back from the table now, with one arm over the back\r\nof his green chair and the other resting on the little table. He was\r\nsmiling under his heavy mustache, and his head was a little on one side\r\nas he looked at her.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what was that dreadful confession you had to make?\u201d he was saying.\r\nHis quiet, kindly smile implied his serene disbelief in any confessible\r\nthing. Ann Veronica pushed aside a tea-cup and the vestiges of her\r\nstrawberries and cream, and put her elbows before her on the table. \u201cMr.\r\nManning,\u201d she said, \u201cI HAVE a confession to make.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish you would use my Christian name,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nShe attended to that, and then dismissed it as unimportant.\r\n\r\nSomething in her voice and manner conveyed an effect of unwonted gravity\r\nto him. For the first time he seemed to wonder what it might be that she\r\nhad to confess. His smile faded.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think our engagement can go on,\u201d she plunged, and felt exactly\r\nthat loss of breath that comes with a dive into icy water.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, how,\u201d he said, sitting up astonished beyond measure, \u201cnot go on?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been thinking while you have been talking. You see--I didn\u2019t\r\nunderstand.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stared hard at her finger-nails. \u201cIt is hard to express one\u2019s self,\r\nbut I do want to be honest with you. When I promised to marry you I\r\nthought I could; I thought it was a possible arrangement. I did think it\r\ncould be done. I admired your chivalry. I was grateful.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe paused.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nShe moved her elbow nearer to him and spoke in a still lower tone. \u201cI\r\ntold you I did not love you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Manning, nodding gravely. \u201cIt was fine and brave of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut there is something more.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe paused again.\r\n\r\n\u201cI--I am sorry--I didn\u2019t explain. These things are difficult. It wasn\u2019t\r\nclear to me that I had to explain.... I love some one else.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey remained looking at each other for three or four seconds. Then\r\nManning flopped back in his chair and dropped his chin like a man shot.\r\nThere was a long silence between them.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God!\u201d he said at last, with tremendous feeling, and then again, \u201cMy\r\nGod!\u201d\r\n\r\nNow that this thing was said her mind was clear and calm. She heard this\r\nstandard expression of a strong soul wrung with a critical coldness that\r\nastonished herself. She realized dimly that there was no personal thing\r\nbehind his cry, that countless myriads of Mannings had \u201cMy God!\u201d-ed with\r\nan equal gusto at situations as flatly apprehended. This mitigated\r\nher remorse enormously. He rested his brow on his hand and conveyed\r\nmagnificent tragedy by his pose.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why,\u201d he said in the gasping voice of one subduing an agony, and\r\nlooked at her from under a pain-wrinkled brow, \u201cwhy did you not tell me\r\nthis before?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know--I thought I might be able to control myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I ought to control myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I have been dreaming and thinking--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am frightfully sorry....\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut--This bolt from the blue! My God! Ann Veronica, you don\u2019t\r\nunderstand. This--this shatters a world!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe tried to feel sorry, but her sense of his immense egotism was strong\r\nand clear.\r\n\r\nHe went on with intense urgency.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you ever let me love you? Why did you ever let me peep through\r\nthe gates of Paradise? Oh! my God! I don\u2019t begin to feel and realize\r\nthis yet. It seems to me just talk; it seems to me like the fancy of a\r\ndream. Tell me I haven\u2019t heard. This is a joke of yours.\u201d He made his\r\nvoice very low and full, and looked closely into her face.\r\n\r\nShe twisted her fingers tightly. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a joke,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel\r\nshabby and disgraced.... I ought never to have thought of it. Of you,\r\nI mean....\u201d\r\n\r\nHe fell back in his chair with an expression of tremendous desolation.\r\n\u201cMy God!\u201d he said again....\r\n\r\nThey became aware of the waitress standing over them with book and\r\npencil ready for their bill. \u201cNever mind the bill,\u201d said Manning\r\ntragically, standing up and thrusting a four-shilling piece into her\r\nhand, and turning a broad back on her astonishment. \u201cLet us walk across\r\nthe Park at least,\u201d he said to Ann Veronica. \u201cJust at present my mind\r\nsimply won\u2019t take hold of this at all.... I tell you--never mind the\r\nbill. Keep it! Keep it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 6\r\n\r\n\r\nThey walked a long way that afternoon. They crossed the Park to the\r\nwestward, and then turned back and walked round the circle about the\r\nRoyal Botanical Gardens and then southwardly toward Waterloo. They\r\ntrudged and talked, and Manning struggled, as he said, to \u201cget the hang\r\nof it all.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a long, meandering talk, stupid, shameful, and unavoidable. Ann\r\nVeronica was apologetic to the bottom of her soul. At the same time she\r\nwas wildly exultant at the resolution she had taken, the end she had\r\nmade to her blunder. She had only to get through this, to solace Manning\r\nas much as she could, to put such clumsy plasterings on his wounds as\r\nwere possible, and then, anyhow, she would be free--free to put her fate\r\nto the test. She made a few protests, a few excuses for her action in\r\naccepting him, a few lame explanations, but he did not heed them or care\r\nfor them. Then she realized that it was her business to let Manning talk\r\nand impose his own interpretations upon the situation so far as he was\r\nconcerned. She did her best to do this. But about his unknown rival he\r\nwas acutely curious.\r\n\r\nHe made her tell him the core of the difficulty.\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot say who he is,\u201d said Ann Veronica, \u201cbut he is a married\r\nman.... No! I do not even know that he cares for me. It is no good going\r\ninto that. Only I just want him. I just want him, and no one else will\r\ndo. It is no good arguing about a thing like that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you thought you could forget him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose I must have thought so. I didn\u2019t understand. Now I do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy God!\u201d said Manning, making the most of the word, \u201cI suppose it\u2019s\r\nfate. Fate! You are so frank so splendid!\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m taking this calmly now,\u201d he said, almost as if he apologized,\r\n\u201cbecause I\u2019m a little stunned.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen he asked, \u201cTell me! has this man, has he DARED to make love to\r\nyou?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica had a vicious moment. \u201cI wish he had,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut--\u201d\r\n\r\nThe long inconsecutive conversation by that time was getting on her\r\nnerves. \u201cWhen one wants a thing more than anything else in the world,\u201d\r\n she said with outrageous frankness, \u201cone naturally wishes one had it.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe shocked him by that. She shattered the edifice he was building up\r\nof himself as a devoted lover, waiting only his chance to win her from a\r\nhopeless and consuming passion.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Manning,\u201d she said, \u201cI warned you not to idealize me. Men ought not\r\nto idealize any woman. We aren\u2019t worth it. We\u2019ve done nothing to deserve\r\nit. And it hampers us. You don\u2019t know the thoughts we have; the things\r\nwe can do and say. You are a sisterless man; you have never heard the\r\nordinary talk that goes on at a girls\u2019 boarding-school.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! but you ARE splendid and open and fearless! As if I couldn\u2019t allow!\r\nWhat are all these little things? Nothing! Nothing! You can\u2019t sully\r\nyourself. You can\u2019t! I tell you frankly you may break off your\r\nengagement to me--I shall hold myself still engaged to you, yours just\r\nthe same. As for this infatuation--it\u2019s like some obsession, some\r\nmagic thing laid upon you. It\u2019s not you--not a bit. It\u2019s a thing that\u2019s\r\nhappened to you. It is like some accident. I don\u2019t care. In a sense I\r\ndon\u2019t care. It makes no difference.... All the same, I wish I had\r\nthat fellow by the throat! Just the virile, unregenerate man in me\r\nwishes that....\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose I should let go if I had.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know,\u201d he went on, \u201cthis doesn\u2019t seem to me to end anything.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m rather a persistent person. I\u2019m the sort of dog, if you turn it out\r\nof the room it lies down on the mat at the door. I\u2019m not a lovesick\r\nboy. I\u2019m a man, and I know what I mean. It\u2019s a tremendous blow, of\r\ncourse--but it doesn\u2019t kill me. And the situation it makes!--the\r\nsituation!\u201d\r\n\r\nThus Manning, egotistical, inconsecutive, unreal. And Ann Veronica\r\nwalked beside him, trying in vain to soften her heart to him by the\r\nthought of how she had ill-used him, and all the time, as her feet and\r\nmind grew weary together, rejoicing more and more that at the cost\r\nof this one interminable walk she escaped the prospect of--what was\r\nit?--\u201cTen thousand days, ten thousand nights\u201d in his company. Whatever\r\nhappened she need never return to that possibility.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor me,\u201d Manning went on, \u201cthis isn\u2019t final. In a sense it alters\r\nnothing. I shall still wear your favor--even if it is a stolen and\r\nforbidden favor--in my casque.... I shall still believe in you. Trust\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe repeated several times that he would trust her, though it remained\r\nobscure just exactly where the trust came in.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here,\u201d he cried out of a silence, with a sudden flash of\r\nunderstanding, \u201cdid you mean to throw me over when you came out with me\r\nthis afternoon?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica hesitated, and with a startled mind realized the truth.\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she answered, reluctantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Manning. \u201cThen I don\u2019t take this as final. That\u2019s all.\r\nI\u2019ve bored you or something.... You think you love this other man! No\r\ndoubt you do love him. Before you have lived--\u201d\r\n\r\nHe became darkly prophetic. He thrust out a rhetorical hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will MAKE you love me! Until he has faded--faded into a memory...\u201d\r\n\r\nHe saw her into the train at Waterloo, and stood, a tall, grave figure,\r\nwith hat upraised, as the carriage moved forward slowly and hid him.\r\nAnn Veronica sat back with a sigh of relief. Manning might go on now\r\nidealizing her as much as he liked. She was no longer a confederate in\r\nthat. He might go on as the devoted lover until he tired. She had done\r\nforever with the Age of Chivalry, and her own base adaptations of its\r\ntraditions to the compromising life. She was honest again.\r\n\r\nBut when she turned her thoughts to Morningside Park she perceived the\r\ntangled skein of life was now to be further complicated by his romantic\r\nimportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH\r\n\r\nTHE COLLAPSE OF THE PENITENT\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 1\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring had held back that year until the dawn of May, and then spring\r\nand summer came with a rush together. Two days after this conversation\r\nbetween Manning and Ann Veronica, Capes came into the laboratory at\r\nlunch-time and found her alone there standing by the open window, and\r\nnot even pretending to be doing anything.\r\n\r\nHe came in with his hands in his trousers pockets and a general air\r\nof depression in his bearing. He was engaged in detesting Manning and\r\nhimself in almost equal measure. His face brightened at the sight of\r\nher, and he came toward her.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Ann Veronica, and stared over her shoulder out of the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo am I.... Lassitude?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_I_ can\u2019t work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor I,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the spring,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the warming up of the year, the coming\r\nof the light mornings, the way in which everything begins to run about\r\nand begin new things. Work becomes distasteful; one thinks of holidays.\r\nThis year--I\u2019ve got it badly. I want to get away. I\u2019ve never wanted to\r\nget away so much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere do you go?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!--Alps.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cClimbing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s rather a fine sort of holiday!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe made no answer for three or four seconds.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cI want to get away. I feel at moments as though I could\r\nbolt for it.... Silly, isn\u2019t it? Undisciplined.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe went to the window and fidgeted with the blind, looking out to where\r\nthe tree-tops of Regent\u2019s Park showed distantly over the houses. He\r\nturned round toward her and found her looking at him and standing very\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the stir of spring,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe it is.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe glanced out of the window, and the distant trees were a froth of\r\nhard spring green and almond blossom. She formed a wild resolution,\r\nand, lest she should waver from it, she set about at once to realize it.\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve broken off my engagement,\u201d she said, in a matter-of-fact tone, and\r\nfound her heart thumping in her neck. He moved slightly, and she\r\nwent on, with a slight catching of her breath: \u201cIt\u2019s a bother and\r\ndisturbance, but you see--\u201d She had to go through with it now, because\r\nshe could think of nothing but her preconceived words. Her voice was\r\nweak and flat.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve fallen in love.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe never helped her by a sound.\r\n\r\n\u201cI--I didn\u2019t love the man I was engaged to,\u201d she said. She met his eyes\r\nfor a moment, and could not interpret their expression. They struck her\r\nas cold and indifferent.\r\n\r\nHer heart failed her and her resolution became water. She remained\r\nstanding stiffly, unable even to move. She could not look at him through\r\nan interval that seemed to her a vast gulf of time. But she felt his lax\r\nfigure become rigid.\r\n\r\nAt last his voice came to release her tension.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t keeping up to the mark. You--It\u2019s jolly of you to\r\nconfide in me. Still--\u201d Then, with incredible and obviously deliberate\r\nstupidity, and a voice as flat as her own, he asked, \u201cWho is the man?\u201d\r\n\r\nHer spirit raged within her at the dumbness, the paralysis that had\r\nfallen upon her. Grace, confidence, the power of movement even, seemed\r\ngone from her. A fever of shame ran through her being. Horrible doubts\r\nassailed her. She sat down awkwardly and helplessly on one of the little\r\nstools by her table and covered her face with her hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you SEE how things are?\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Capes could answer her in any way the door at the end of the\r\nlaboratory opened noisily and Miss Klegg appeared. She went to her own\r\ntable and sat down. At the sound of the door Ann Veronica uncovered\r\na tearless face, and with one swift movement assumed a conversational\r\nattitude. Things hung for a moment in an awkward silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d said Ann Veronica, staring before her at the window-sash,\r\n\u201cthat\u2019s the form my question takes at the present time.\u201d\r\n\r\nCapes had not quite the same power of recovery. He stood with his\r\nhands in his pockets looking at Miss Klegg\u2019s back. His face was white.\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s--it\u2019s a difficult question.\u201d He appeared to be paralyzed by\r\nabstruse acoustic calculations. Then, very awkwardly, he took a stool\r\nand placed it at the end of Ann Veronica\u2019s table, and sat down. He\r\nglanced at Miss Klegg again, and spoke quickly and furtively, with eager\r\neyes on Ann Veronica\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had a faint idea once that things were as you say they are, but the\r\naffair of the ring--of the unexpected ring--puzzled me. Wish SHE\u201d--he\r\nindicated Miss Klegg\u2019s back with a nod--\u201cwas at the bottom of the\r\nsea.... I would like to talk to you about this--soon. If you don\u2019t think\r\nit would be a social outrage, perhaps I might walk with you to your\r\nrailway station.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will wait,\u201d said Ann Veronica, still not looking at him, \u201cand we will\r\ngo into Regent\u2019s Park. No--you shall come with me to Waterloo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRight!\u201d he said, and hesitated, and then got up and went into the\r\npreparation-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a time they walked in silence through the back streets that lead\r\nsouthward from the College. Capes bore a face of infinite perplexity.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe thing I feel most disposed to say, Miss Stanley,\u201d he began at last,\r\n\u201cis that this is very sudden.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been coming on since first I came into the laboratory.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he asked, bluntly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou!\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\nThe sense of publicity, of people coming and going about them, kept\r\nthem both unemotional. And neither had any of that theatricality which\r\ndemands gestures and facial expression.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose you know I like you tremendously?\u201d he pursued.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou told me that in the Zoological Gardens.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe found her muscles a-tremble. But there was nothing in her bearing\r\nthat a passer-by would have noted, to tell of the excitement that\r\npossessed her.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u201d--he seemed to have a difficulty with the word--\u201cI love you. I\u2019ve\r\ntold you that practically already. But I can give it its name now. You\r\nneedn\u2019t be in any doubt about it. I tell you that because it puts us on\r\na footing....\u201d\r\n\r\nThey went on for a time without another word.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you know about me?\u201d he said at last.\r\n\r\n\u201cSomething. Not much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a married man. And my wife won\u2019t live with me for reasons that I\r\nthink most women would consider sound.... Or I should have made love\r\nto you long ago.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere came a silence again.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut if you knew anything of that--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you tell me? I thought--I thought we were going to be friends.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was suddenly resentful. He seemed to charge her with the ruin of\r\ntheir situation. \u201cWhy on earth did you TELL me?\u201d he cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it. It was an impulse. I HAD to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it changes things. I thought you understood.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI had to,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI was sick of the make-believe. I don\u2019t care!\r\nI\u2019m glad I did. I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here!\u201d said Capes, \u201cwhat on earth do you want? What do you think\r\nwe can do? Don\u2019t you know what men are, and what life is?--to come to me\r\nand talk to me like this!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know--something, anyhow. But I don\u2019t care; I haven\u2019t a spark of\r\nshame. I don\u2019t see any good in life if it hasn\u2019t got you in it. I wanted\r\nyou to know. And now you know. And the fences are down for good. You\r\ncan\u2019t look me in the eyes and say you don\u2019t care for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Ann Veronica, with an air of concluding the\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nThey walked side by side for a time.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn that laboratory one gets to disregard these passions,\u201d began Capes.\r\n\u201cMen are curious animals, with a trick of falling in love readily\r\nwith girls about your age. One has to train one\u2019s self not to. I\u2019ve\r\naccustomed myself to think of you--as if you were like every other\r\ngirl who works at the schools--as something quite outside these\r\npossibilities. If only out of loyalty to co-education one has to do\r\nthat. Apart from everything else, this meeting of ours is a breach of a\r\ngood rule.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRules are for every day,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cThis is not every day.\r\nThis is something above all rules.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot for you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. No; I\u2019m going to stick to the rules.... It\u2019s odd, but nothing\r\nbut cliche seems to meet this case. You\u2019ve placed me in a very\r\nexceptional position, Miss Stanley.\u201d The note of his own voice\r\nexasperated him. \u201cOh, damn!\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nShe made no answer, and for a time he debated some problems with\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d he said aloud at last.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe plain common-sense of the case,\u201d he said, \u201cis that we can\u2019t\r\npossibly be lovers in the ordinary sense. That, I think, is manifest.\r\nYou know, I\u2019ve done no work at all this afternoon. I\u2019ve been smoking\r\ncigarettes in the preparation-room and thinking this out. We can\u2019t be\r\nlovers in the ordinary sense, but we can be great and intimate friends.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve interested me enormously....\u201d\r\n\r\nHe paused with a sense of ineptitude. \u201cI want to be your friend,\u201d he\r\nsaid. \u201cI said that at the Zoo, and I mean it. Let us be friends--as near\r\nand close as friends can be.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica gave him a pallid profile.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the good of pretending?\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t pretend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe do. Love is one thing and friendship quite another. Because I\u2019m\r\nyounger than you.... I\u2019ve got imagination.... I know what I am\r\ntalking about. Mr. Capes, do you think... do you think I don\u2019t know\r\nthe meaning of love?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 4\r\n\r\n\r\nCapes made no answer for a time.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy mind is full of confused stuff,\u201d he said at length. \u201cI\u2019ve been\r\nthinking--all the afternoon. Oh, and weeks and months of thought and\r\nfeeling there are bottled up too.... I feel a mixture of beast and\r\nuncle. I feel like a fraudulent trustee. Every rule is against me--Why\r\ndid I let you begin this? I might have told--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that you could help--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI might have helped--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI ought to have--all the same.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d he said, and went off at a tangent. \u201cYou know about my\r\nscandalous past?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery little. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter. Does it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it does. Profoundly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt prevents our marrying. It forbids--all sorts of things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt can\u2019t prevent our loving.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid it can\u2019t. But, by Jove! it\u2019s going to make our loving a\r\nfiercely abstract thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are separated from your wife?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but do you know how?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot exactly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy on earth--? A man ought to be labelled. You see, I\u2019m separated from\r\nmy wife. But she doesn\u2019t and won\u2019t divorce me. You don\u2019t understand\r\nthe fix I am in. And you don\u2019t know what led to our separation. And, in\r\nfact, all round the problem you don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t see how I could\r\npossibly have told you before. I wanted to, that day in the Zoo. But I\r\ntrusted to that ring of yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor old ring!\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cI ought never have gone to the Zoo, I suppose. I asked you to go. But\r\na man is a mixed creature.... I wanted the time with you. I wanted it\r\nbadly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me about yourself,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo begin with, I was--I was in the divorce court. I was--I was a\r\nco-respondent. You understand that term?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica smiled faintly. \u201cA modern girl does understand these terms.\r\nShe reads novels--and history--and all sorts of things. Did you really\r\ndoubt if I knew?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. But I don\u2019t suppose you can understand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo know things by name is one thing; to know them by seeing them and\r\nfeeling them and being them quite another. That is where life takes\r\nadvantage of youth. You don\u2019t understand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps I don\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t. That\u2019s the difficulty. If I told you the facts, I expect,\r\nsince you are in love with me, you\u2019d explain the whole business as being\r\nvery fine and honorable for me--the Higher Morality, or something of\r\nthat sort.... It wasn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t deal very much,\u201d said Ann Veronica, \u201cin the Higher Morality, or\r\nthe Higher Truth, or any of those things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you don\u2019t. But a human being who is young and clean, as you\r\nare, is apt to ennoble--or explain away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a biological training. I\u2019m a hard young woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNice clean hardness, anyhow. I think you are hard. There\u2019s\r\nsomething--something ADULT about you. I\u2019m talking to you now as though\r\nyou had all the wisdom and charity in the world. I\u2019m going to tell you\r\nthings plainly. Plainly. It\u2019s best. And then you can go home and think\r\nthings over before we talk again. I want you to be clear what you\u2019re\r\nreally and truly up to, anyhow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind knowing,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s precious unromantic.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, tell me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI married pretty young,\u201d said Capes. \u201cI\u2019ve got--I have to tell you this\r\nto make myself clear--a streak of ardent animal in my composition. I\r\nmarried--I married a woman whom I still think one of the most beautiful\r\npersons in the world. She is a year or so older than I am, and she is,\r\nwell, of a very serene and proud and dignified temperament. If you met\r\nher you would, I am certain, think her as fine as I do. She has never\r\ndone a really ignoble thing that I know of--never. I met her when we\r\nwere both very young, as young as you are. I loved her and made love to\r\nher, and I don\u2019t think she quite loved me back in the same way.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe paused for a time. Ann Veronica said nothing.\r\n\r\n\u201cThese are the sort of things that aren\u2019t supposed to happen. They leave\r\nthem out of novels--these incompatibilities. Young people ignore them\r\nuntil they find themselves up against them. My wife doesn\u2019t understand,\r\ndoesn\u2019t understand now. She despises me, I suppose.... We married,\r\nand for a time we were happy. She was fine and tender. I worshipped her\r\nand subdued myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe left off abruptly. \u201cDo you understand what I am talking about? It\u2019s\r\nno good if you don\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think so,\u201d said Ann Veronica, and colored. \u201cIn fact, yes, I do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think of these things--these matters--as belonging to our Higher\r\nNature or our Lower?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t deal in Higher Things, I tell you,\u201d said Ann Veronica, \u201cor\r\nLower, for the matter of that. I don\u2019t classify.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cFlesh\r\nand flowers are all alike to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the comfort of you. Well, after a time there came a fever in\r\nmy blood. Don\u2019t think it was anything better than fever--or a bit\r\nbeautiful. It wasn\u2019t. Quite soon, after we were married--it was just\r\nwithin a year--I formed a friendship with the wife of a friend, a woman\r\neight years older than myself.... It wasn\u2019t anything splendid, you\r\nknow. It was just a shabby, stupid, furtive business that began between\r\nus. Like stealing. We dressed it in a little music.... I want you to\r\nunderstand clearly that I was indebted to the man in many small ways. I\r\nwas mean to him.... It was the gratification of an immense necessity.\r\nWe were two people with a craving. We felt like thieves. We WERE\r\nthieves.... We LIKED each other well enough. Well, my friend found\r\nus out, and would give no quarter. He divorced her. How do you like the\r\nstory?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on,\u201d said Ann Veronica, a little hoarsely, \u201ctell me all of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy wife was astounded--wounded beyond measure. She thought me--filthy.\r\nAll her pride raged at me. One particularly humiliating thing came\r\nout--humiliating for me. There was a second co-respondent. I hadn\u2019t\r\nheard of him before the trial. I don\u2019t know why that should be so\r\nacutely humiliating. There\u2019s no logic in these things. It was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor you!\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy wife refused absolutely to have anything more to do with me. She\r\ncould hardly speak to me; she insisted relentlessly upon a separation.\r\nShe had money of her own--much more than I have--and there was no need\r\nto squabble about that. She has given herself up to social work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all. Practically all. And yet--Wait a little, you\u2019d better have\r\nevery bit of it. One doesn\u2019t go about with these passions allayed simply\r\nbecause they have made wreckage and a scandal. There one is! The same\r\nstuff still! One has a craving in one\u2019s blood, a craving roused, cut off\r\nfrom its redeeming and guiding emotional side. A man has more freedom to\r\ndo evil than a woman. Irregularly, in a quite inglorious and unromantic\r\nway, you know, I am a vicious man. That\u2019s--that\u2019s my private life. Until\r\nthe last few months. It isn\u2019t what I have been but what I am. I haven\u2019t\r\ntaken much account of it until now. My honor has been in my scientific\r\nwork and public discussion and the things I write. Lots of us are like\r\nthat. But, you see, I\u2019m smirched. For the sort of love-making you think\r\nabout. I\u2019ve muddled all this business. I\u2019ve had my time and lost my\r\nchances. I\u2019m damaged goods. And you\u2019re as clean as fire. You come with\r\nthose clear eyes of yours, as valiant as an angel....\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so strange to think of you--troubled by such things. I didn\u2019t\r\nthink--I don\u2019t know what I thought. Suddenly all this makes you human.\r\nMakes you real.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you see how I must stand to you? Don\u2019t you see how it bars us\r\nfrom being lovers--You can\u2019t--at first. You must think it over. It\u2019s all\r\noutside the world of your experience.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it makes a rap of difference, except for one thing. I\r\nlove you more. I\u2019ve wanted you--always. I didn\u2019t dream, not even in my\r\nwildest dreaming, that--you might have any need of me.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe made a little noise in his throat as if something had cried out\r\nwithin him, and for a time they were both too full for speech.\r\n\r\nThey were going up the slope into Waterloo Station.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou go home and think of all this,\u201d he said, \u201cand talk about it\r\nto-morrow. Don\u2019t, don\u2019t say anything now, not anything. As for loving\r\nyou, I do. I do--with all my heart. It\u2019s no good hiding it any more.\r\nI could never have talked to you like this, forgetting everything that\r\nparts us, forgetting even your age, if I did not love you utterly. If\r\nI were a clean, free man--We\u2019ll have to talk of all these things. Thank\r\ngoodness there\u2019s plenty of opportunity! And we two can talk. Anyhow, now\r\nyou\u2019ve begun it, there\u2019s nothing to keep us in all this from being the\r\nbest friends in the world. And talking of every conceivable thing. Is\r\nthere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Ann Veronica, with a radiant face.\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore this there was a sort of restraint--a make-believe. It\u2019s gone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFriendship and love being separate things. And that confounded\r\nengagement!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGone!\u201d\r\n\r\nThey came upon a platform, and stood before her compartment.\r\n\r\nHe took her hand and looked into her eyes and spoke, divided against\r\nhimself, in a voice that was forced and insincere.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall be very glad to have you for a friend,\u201d he said, \u201cloving\r\nfriend. I had never dreamed of such a friend as you.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe smiled, sure of herself beyond any pretending, into his troubled\r\neyes. Hadn\u2019t they settled that already?\r\n\r\n\u201cI want you as a friend,\u201d he persisted, almost as if he disputed\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 5\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning she waited in the laboratory at the lunch-hour in the\r\nreasonable certainty that he would come to her.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you have thought it over?\u201d he said, sitting down beside her.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking of you all night,\u201d she answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care a rap for all these things.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe said nothing for a space.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see there\u2019s any getting away from the fact that you and I love\r\neach other,\u201d he said, slowly. \u201cSo far you\u2019ve got me and I you....\r\nYou\u2019ve got me. I\u2019m like a creature just wakened up. My eyes are open to\r\nyou. I keep on thinking of you. I keep on thinking of little details and\r\naspects of your voice, your eyes, the way you walk, the way your hair\r\ngoes back from the side of your forehead. I believe I have always been\r\nin love with you. Always. Before ever I knew you.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe sat motionless, with her hand tightening over the edge of the table,\r\nand he, too, said no more. She began to tremble violently.\r\n\r\nHe stood up abruptly and went to the window.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have,\u201d he said, \u201cto be the utmost friends.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stood up and held her arms toward him. \u201cI want you to kiss me,\u201d she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHe gripped the window-sill behind him.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I do,\u201d he said.... \u201cNo! I want to do without that. I want to\r\ndo without that for a time. I want to give you time to think. I am a\r\nman--of a sort of experience. You are a girl with very little. Just sit\r\ndown on that stool again and let\u2019s talk of this in cold blood. People of\r\nyour sort--I don\u2019t want the instincts to--to rush our situation. Are you\r\nsure what it is you want of me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI want you. I want you to be my lover. I want to give myself to you.\r\nI want to be whatever I can to you.\u201d She paused for a moment. \u201cIs that\r\nplain?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t love you better than myself,\u201d said Capes, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t fence\r\nlike this with you.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am convinced you haven\u2019t thought this out,\u201d he went on. \u201cYou do not\r\nknow what such a relation means. We are in love. Our heads swim with\r\nthe thought of being together. But what can we do? Here am I, fixed to\r\nrespectability and this laboratory; you\u2019re living at home. It means...\r\njust furtive meetings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how we meet,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will spoil your life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will make it. I want you. I am clear I want you. You are different\r\nfrom all the world for me. You can think all round me. You are the one\r\nperson I can understand and feel--feel right with. I don\u2019t idealize you.\r\nDon\u2019t imagine that. It isn\u2019t because you\u2019re good, but because I may be\r\nrotten bad; and there\u2019s something--something living and understanding\r\nin you. Something that is born anew each time we meet, and pines when\r\nwe are separated. You see, I\u2019m selfish. I\u2019m rather scornful. I think\r\ntoo much about myself. You\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve really given good,\r\nstraight, unselfish thought to. I\u2019m making a mess of my life--unless\r\nyou come in and take it. I am. In you--if you can love me--there\r\nis salvation. Salvation. I know what I am doing better than you do.\r\nThink--think of that engagement!\u201d\r\n\r\nTheir talk had come to eloquent silences that contradicted all he had to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nShe stood up before him, smiling faintly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve exhausted this discussion,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think we have,\u201d he answered, gravely, and took her in his arms, and\r\nsmoothed her hair from her forehead, and very tenderly kissed her lips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 6\r\n\r\n\r\nThey spent the next Sunday in Richmond Park, and mingled the happy\r\nsensation of being together uninterruptedly through the long sunshine\r\nof a summer\u2019s day with the ample discussion of their position. \u201cThis has\r\nall the clean freshness of spring and youth,\u201d said Capes; \u201cit is love\r\nwith the down on; it is like the glitter of dew in the sunlight to be\r\nlovers such as we are, with no more than one warm kiss between us. I\r\nlove everything to-day, and all of you, but I love this, this--this\r\ninnocence upon us most of all.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat a beastly thing a furtive love\r\naffair can be.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t furtive,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it. And we won\u2019t make it so.... We mustn\u2019t make it so.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey loitered under trees, they sat on mossy banks they gossiped on\r\nfriendly benches, they came back to lunch at the \u201cStar and Garter,\u201d\r\n and talked their afternoon away in the garden that looks out upon the\r\ncrescent of the river. They had a universe to talk about--two universes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d said Capes, with his eyes on the broad\r\ndistances beyond the ribbon of the river.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do whatever you want,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy first love was all blundering,\u201d said Capes.\r\n\r\nHe thought for a moment, and went on: \u201cLove is something that has to be\r\ntaken care of. One has to be so careful.... It\u2019s a beautiful plant,\r\nbut a tender one.... I didn\u2019t know. I\u2019ve a dread of love dropping its\r\npetals, becoming mean and ugly. How can I tell you all I feel? I love\r\nyou beyond measure. And I\u2019m afraid.... I\u2019m anxious, joyfully anxious,\r\nlike a man when he has found a treasure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYOU know,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cI just came to you and put myself in\r\nyour hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, in a way, I\u2019m prudish. I\u2019ve--dreads. I don\u2019t want to tear\r\nat you with hot, rough hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you will, dear lover. But for me it doesn\u2019t matter. Nothing is wrong\r\nthat you do. Nothing. I am quite clear about this. I know exactly what I\r\nam doing. I give myself to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGod send you may never repent it!\u201d cried Capes.\r\n\r\nShe put her hand in his to be squeezed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d he said, \u201cit is doubtful if we can ever marry. Very doubtful.\r\nI have been thinking--I will go to my wife again. I will do my utmost.\r\nBut for a long time, anyhow, we lovers have to be as if we were no more\r\nthan friends.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe paused. She answered slowly. \u201cThat is as you will,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy should it matter?\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as she answered nothing, \u201cSeeing that we are lovers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 7\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was rather less than a week after that walk that Capes came and sat\r\ndown beside Ann Veronica for their customary talk in the lunch hour. He\r\ntook a handful of almonds and raisins that she held out to him--for\r\nboth these young people had given up the practice of going out for\r\nluncheon--and kept her hand for a moment to kiss her finger-tips. He did\r\nnot speak for a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cI say!\u201d he said, without any movement. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo!\u201d She did not understand him at first, and then her heart began to\r\nbeat very rapidly.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop this--this humbugging,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Picture and\r\nthe Bust. I can\u2019t stand it. Let\u2019s go. Go off and live together--until we\r\ncan marry. Dare you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean NOW?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the end of the session. It\u2019s the only clean way for us. Are you\r\nprepared to do it?\u201d\r\n\r\nHer hands clenched. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, very faintly. And then: \u201cOf course!\r\nAlways. It is what I have wanted, what I have meant all along.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stared before her, trying to keep back a rush of tears.\r\n\r\nCapes kept obstinately stiff, and spoke between his teeth.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s endless reasons, no doubt, why we shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said.\r\n\u201cEndless. It\u2019s wrong in the eyes of most people. For many of them it\r\nwill smirch us forever.... You DO understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho cares for most people?\u201d she said, not looking at him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do. It means social isolation--struggle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you dare--I dare,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cI was never so clear in all\r\nmy life as I have been in this business.\u201d She lifted steadfast eyes to\r\nhim. \u201cDare!\u201d she said. The tears were welling over now, but her voice\r\nwas steady. \u201cYou\u2019re not a man for me--not one of a sex, I mean. You\u2019re\r\njust a particular being with nothing else in the world to class with\r\nyou. You are just necessary to life for me. I\u2019ve never met any one\r\nlike you. To have you is all important. Nothing else weighs against it.\r\nMorals only begin when that is settled. I sha\u2019n\u2019t care a rap if we can\r\nnever marry. I\u2019m not a bit afraid of anything--scandal, difficulty,\r\nstruggle.... I rather want them. I do want them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get them,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means a plunge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly for you! Most of my income will vanish. Even unbelieving\r\nbiological demonstrators must respect decorum; and besides, you see--you\r\nwere a student. We shall have--hardly any money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHardship and danger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd as for your people?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey don\u2019t count. That is the dreadful truth. This--all this swamps\r\nthem. They don\u2019t count, and I don\u2019t care.\u201d\r\n\r\nCapes suddenly abandoned his attitude of meditative restraint. \u201cBy\r\nJove!\u201d he broke out, \u201cone tries to take a serious, sober view. I don\u2019t\r\nquite know why. But this is a great lark, Ann Veronica! This turns life\r\ninto a glorious adventure!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d she cried in triumph.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall have to give up biology, anyhow. I\u2019ve always had a sneaking\r\ndesire for the writing-trade. That is what I must do. I can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course you can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd biology was beginning to bore me a bit. One research is very like\r\nanother.... Latterly I\u2019ve been doing things.... Creative work\r\nappeals to me wonderfully. Things seem to come rather easily.... But\r\nthat, and that sort of thing, is just a day-dream. For a time I must do\r\njournalism and work hard.... What isn\u2019t a day-dream is this: that you\r\nand I are going to put an end to flummery--and go!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo!\u201d said Ann Veronica, clenching her hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor better or worse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor richer or poorer.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe could not go on, for she was laughing and crying at the same time.\r\n\u201cWe were bound to do this when you kissed me,\u201d she sobbed through\r\nher tears. \u201cWe have been all this time--Only your queer code of\r\nhonor--Honor! Once you begin with love you have to see it through.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIFTEENTH\r\n\r\nTHE LAST DAYS AT HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 1\r\n\r\n\r\nThey decided to go to Switzerland at the session\u2019s end. \u201cWe\u2019ll clean up\r\neverything tidy,\u201d said Capes....\r\n\r\nFor her pride\u2019s sake, and to save herself from long day-dreams and an\r\nunappeasable longing for her lover, Ann Veronica worked hard at her\r\nbiology during those closing weeks. She was, as Capes had said, a\r\nhard young woman. She was keenly resolved to do well in the school\r\nexamination, and not to be drowned in the seas of emotion that\r\nthreatened to submerge her intellectual being.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she could not prevent a rising excitement as the dawn of\r\nthe new life drew near to her--a thrilling of the nerves, a secret\r\nand delicious exaltation above the common circumstances of\r\nexistence. Sometimes her straying mind would become astonishingly\r\nactive--embroidering bright and decorative things that she could say to\r\nCapes; sometimes it passed into a state of passive acquiescence, into\r\na radiant, formless, golden joy. She was aware of people--her aunt,\r\nher father, her fellow-students, friends, and neighbors--moving about\r\noutside this glowing secret, very much as an actor is aware of the dim\r\naudience beyond the barrier of the footlights. They might applaud, or\r\nobject, or interfere, but the drama was her very own. She was going\r\nthrough with that, anyhow.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of last days grew stronger with her as their number\r\ndiminished. She went about the familiar home with a clearer and clearer\r\nsense of inevitable conclusions. She became exceptionally considerate\r\nand affectionate with her father and aunt, and more and more concerned\r\nabout the coming catastrophe that she was about to precipitate upon\r\nthem. Her aunt had a once exasperating habit of interrupting her work\r\nwith demands for small household services, but now Ann Veronica rendered\r\nthem with a queer readiness of anticipatory propitiation. She was\r\ngreatly exercised by the problem of confiding in the Widgetts; they were\r\ndears, and she talked away two evenings with Constance without broaching\r\nthe topic; she made some vague intimations in letters to Miss Miniver\r\nthat Miss Miniver failed to mark. But she did not bother her head very\r\nmuch about her relations with these sympathizers.\r\n\r\nAnd at length her penultimate day in Morningside Park dawned for her.\r\nShe got up early, and walked about the garden in the dewy June sunshine\r\nand revived her childhood. She was saying good-bye to childhood and\r\nhome, and her making; she was going out into the great, multitudinous\r\nworld; this time there would be no returning. She was at the end of\r\ngirlhood and on the eve of a woman\u2019s crowning experience. She visited\r\nthe corner that had been her own little garden--her forget-me-nots and\r\ncandytuft had long since been elbowed into insignificance by weeds; she\r\nvisited the raspberry-canes that had sheltered that first love affair\r\nwith the little boy in velvet, and the greenhouse where she had been\r\nwont to read her secret letters. Here was the place behind the shed\r\nwhere she had used to hide from Roddy\u2019s persecutions, and here the\r\nborder of herbaceous perennials under whose stems was fairyland. The\r\nback of the house had been the Alps for climbing, and the shrubs\r\nin front of it a Terai. The knots and broken pale that made the\r\ngarden-fence scalable, and gave access to the fields behind, were still\r\nto be traced. And here against a wall were the plum-trees. In spite of\r\nGod and wasps and her father, she had stolen plums; and once because of\r\ndiscovered misdeeds, and once because she had realized that her mother\r\nwas dead, she had lain on her face in the unmown grass, beneath the\r\nelm-trees that came beyond the vegetables, and poured out her soul in\r\nweeping.\r\n\r\nRemote little Ann Veronica! She would never know the heart of that child\r\nagain! That child had loved fairy princes with velvet suits and golden\r\nlocks, and she was in love with a real man named Capes, with little\r\ngleams of gold on his cheek and a pleasant voice and firm and shapely\r\nhands. She was going to him soon and certainly, going to his strong,\r\nembracing arms. She was going through a new world with him side by side.\r\nShe had been so busy with life that, for a vast gulf of time, as it\r\nseemed, she had given no thought to those ancient, imagined things of\r\nher childhood. Now, abruptly, they were real again, though very distant,\r\nand she had come to say farewell to them across one sundering year.\r\n\r\nShe was unusually helpful at breakfast, and unselfish about the eggs:\r\nand then she went off to catch the train before her father\u2019s. She did\r\nthis to please him. He hated travelling second-class with her--indeed,\r\nhe never did--but he also disliked travelling in the same train when his\r\ndaughter was in an inferior class, because of the look of the thing.\r\nSo he liked to go by a different train. And in the Avenue she had an\r\nencounter with Ramage.\r\n\r\nIt was an odd little encounter, that left vague and dubitable\r\nimpressions in her mind. She was aware of him--a silk-hatted,\r\nshiny-black figure on the opposite side of the Avenue; and then,\r\nabruptly and startlingly, he crossed the road and saluted and spoke to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\u201cI MUST speak to you,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t keep away from you.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe made some inane response. She was struck by a change in his\r\nappearance. His eyes looked a little bloodshot to her; his face had lost\r\nsomething of its ruddy freshness.\r\n\r\nHe began a jerky, broken conversation that lasted until they reached the\r\nstation, and left her puzzled at its drift and meaning. She quickened\r\nher pace, and so did he, talking at her slightly averted ear. She made\r\nlumpish and inadequate interruptions rather than replies. At times he\r\nseemed to be claiming pity from her; at times he was threatening her\r\nwith her check and exposure; at times he was boasting of his inflexible\r\nwill, and how, in the end, he always got what he wanted. He said that\r\nhis life was boring and stupid without her. Something or other--she\r\ndid not catch what--he was damned if he could stand. He was evidently\r\nnervous, and very anxious to be impressive; his projecting eyes sought\r\nto dominate. The crowning aspect of the incident, for her mind, was the\r\ndiscovery that he and her indiscretion with him no longer mattered very\r\nmuch. Its importance had vanished with her abandonment of compromise.\r\nEven her debt to him was a triviality now.\r\n\r\nAnd of course! She had a brilliant idea. It surprised her she hadn\u2019t\r\nthought of it before! She tried to explain that she was going to pay\r\nhim forty pounds without fail next week. She said as much to him. She\r\nrepeated this breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was glad you did not send it back again,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nHe touched a long-standing sore, and Ann Veronica found herself vainly\r\ntrying to explain--the inexplicable. \u201cIt\u2019s because I mean to send it\r\nback altogether,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\nHe ignored her protests in order to pursue some impressive line of his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere we are, living in the same suburb,\u201d he began. \u201cWe have to\r\nbe--modern.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer heart leaped within her as she caught that phrase. That knot also\r\nwould be cut. Modern, indeed! She was going to be as primordial as\r\nchipped flint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the late afternoon, as Ann Veronica was gathering flowers for the\r\ndinner-table, her father came strolling across the lawn toward her with\r\nan affectation of great deliberation.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to speak to you about a little thing, Vee,\u201d said Mr. Stanley.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica\u2019s tense nerves started, and she stood still with her eyes\r\nupon him, wondering what it might be that impended.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were talking to that fellow Ramage to-day--in the Avenue. Walking\r\nto the station with him.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo that was it!\r\n\r\n\u201cHe came and talked to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYe--e--es.\u201d Mr. Stanley considered. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want you to talk to\r\nhim,\u201d he said, very firmly.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica paused before she answered. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I ought to?\u201d\r\n she asked, very submissively.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Mr. Stanley coughed and faced toward the house. \u201cHe is not--I\r\ndon\u2019t like him. I think it inadvisable--I don\u2019t want an intimacy to\r\nspring up between you and a man of that type.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica reflected. \u201cI HAVE--had one or two talks with him, daddy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let there be any more. I--In fact, I dislike him extremely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuppose he comes and talks to me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA girl can always keep a man at a distance if she cares to do it.\r\nShe--She can snub him.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica picked a cornflower.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t make this objection,\u201d Mr. Stanley went on, \u201cbut there are\r\nthings--there are stories about Ramage. He\u2019s--He lives in a world of\r\npossibilities outside your imagination. His treatment of his wife\r\nis most unsatisfactory. Most unsatisfactory. A bad man, in fact. A\r\ndissipated, loose-living man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try not to see him again,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you\r\nobjected to him, daddy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStrongly,\u201d said Mr. Stanley, \u201cvery strongly.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe conversation hung. Ann Veronica wondered what her father would do if\r\nshe were to tell him the full story of her relations with Ramage.\r\n\r\n\u201cA man like that taints a girl by looking at her, by his mere\r\nconversation.\u201d He adjusted his glasses on his nose. There was another\r\nlittle thing he had to say. \u201cOne has to be so careful of one\u2019s friends\r\nand acquaintances,\u201d he remarked, by way of transition. \u201cThey mould one\r\ninsensibly.\u201d His voice assumed an easy detached tone. \u201cI suppose, Vee,\r\nyou don\u2019t see much of those Widgetts now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI go in and talk to Constance sometimes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were great friends at school.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo doubt.... Still--I don\u2019t know whether I quite like--Something\r\nramshackle about those people, Vee. While I am talking about your\r\nfriends, I feel--I think you ought to know how I look at it.\u201d His voice\r\nconveyed studied moderation. \u201cI don\u2019t mind, of course, your seeing\r\nher sometimes, still there are differences--differences in social\r\natmospheres. One gets drawn into things. Before you know where you\r\nare you find yourself in a complication. I don\u2019t want to influence you\r\nunduly--But--They\u2019re artistic people, Vee. That\u2019s the fact about them.\r\nWe\u2019re different.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose we are,\u201d said Vee, rearranging the flowers in her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cFriendships that are all very well between school-girls don\u2019t always go\r\non into later life. It\u2019s--it\u2019s a social difference.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI like Constance very much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo doubt. Still, one has to be reasonable. As you admitted to me--one\r\nhas to square one\u2019s self with the world. You don\u2019t know. With people\r\nof that sort all sorts of things may happen. We don\u2019t want things to\r\nhappen.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica made no answer.\r\n\r\nA vague desire to justify himself ruffled her father. \u201cI may seem\r\nunduly--anxious. I can\u2019t forget about your sister. It\u2019s that has always\r\nmade me--SHE, you know, was drawn into a set--didn\u2019t discriminate\r\nPrivate theatricals.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica remained anxious to hear more of her sister\u2019s story from\r\nher father\u2019s point of view, but he did not go on. Even so much allusion\r\nas this to that family shadow, she felt, was an immense recognition of\r\nher ripening years. She glanced at him. He stood a little anxious and\r\nfussy, bothered by the responsibility of her, entirely careless of what\r\nher life was or was likely to be, ignoring her thoughts and feelings,\r\nignorant of every fact of importance in her life, explaining everything\r\nhe could not understand in her as nonsense and perversity, concerned\r\nonly with a terror of bothers and undesirable situations. \u201cWe don\u2019t want\r\nthings to happen!\u201d Never had he shown his daughter so clearly that the\r\nwomenkind he was persuaded he had to protect and control could please\r\nhim in one way, and in one way only, and that was by doing nothing\r\nexcept the punctual domestic duties and being nothing except restful\r\nappearances. He had quite enough to see to and worry about in the City\r\nwithout their doing things. He had no use for Ann Veronica; he had\r\nnever had a use for her since she had been too old to sit upon his knee.\r\nNothing but the constraint of social usage now linked him to her. And\r\nthe less \u201canything\u201d happened the better. The less she lived, in fact,\r\nthe better. These realizations rushed into Ann Veronica\u2019s mind and\r\nhardened her heart against him. She spoke slowly. \u201cI may not see the\r\nWidgetts for some little time, father,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\r\nshall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome little tiff?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; but I don\u2019t think I shall see them.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuppose she were to add, \u201cI am going away!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear you say it,\u201d said Mr. Stanley, and was so evidently\r\npleased that Ann Veronica\u2019s heart smote her.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am very glad to hear you say it,\u201d he repeated, and refrained from\r\nfurther inquiry. \u201cI think we are growing sensible,\u201d he said. \u201cI think\r\nyou are getting to understand me better.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, and walked away from her toward the house. Her eyes\r\nfollowed him. The curve of his shoulders, the very angle of his feet,\r\nexpressed relief at her apparent obedience. \u201cThank goodness!\u201d said\r\nthat retreating aspect, \u201cthat\u2019s said and over. Vee\u2019s all right. There\u2019s\r\nnothing happened at all!\u201d She didn\u2019t mean, he concluded, to give him any\r\nmore trouble ever, and he was free to begin a fresh chromatic novel--he\r\nhad just finished the Blue Lagoon, which he thought very beautiful and\r\ntender and absolutely irrelevant to Morningside Park--or work in peace\r\nat his microtome without bothering about her in the least.\r\n\r\nThe immense disillusionment that awaited him! The devastating\r\ndisillusionment! She had a vague desire to run after him, to state her\r\ncase to him, to wring some understanding from him of what life was to\r\nher. She felt a cheat and a sneak to his unsuspecting retreating back.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what can one do?\u201d asked Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3\r\n\r\n\r\nShe dressed carefully for dinner in a black dress that her father\r\nliked, and that made her look serious and responsible. Dinner was quite\r\nuneventful. Her father read a draft prospectus warily, and her aunt\r\ndropped fragments of her projects for managing while the cook had a\r\nholiday. After dinner Ann Veronica went into the drawing-room with Miss\r\nStanley, and her father went up to his den for his pipe and pensive\r\npetrography. Later in the evening she heard him whistling, poor man!\r\n\r\nShe felt very restless and excited. She refused coffee, though she knew\r\nthat anyhow she was doomed to a sleepless night. She took up one of her\r\nfather\u2019s novels and put it down again, fretted up to her own room for\r\nsome work, sat on her bed and meditated upon the room that she was now\r\nreally abandoning forever, and returned at length with a stocking to\r\ndarn. Her aunt was making herself cuffs out of little slips of insertion\r\nunder the newly lit lamp.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica sat down in the other arm-chair and darned badly for a\r\nminute or so. Then she looked at her aunt, and traced with a curious eye\r\nthe careful arrangement of her hair, her sharp nose, the little drooping\r\nlines of mouth and chin and cheek.\r\n\r\nHer thought spoke aloud. \u201cWere you ever in love, aunt?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\nHer aunt glanced up startled, and then sat very still, with hands that\r\nhad ceased to work. \u201cWhat makes you ask such a question, Vee?\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wondered.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer aunt answered in a low voice: \u201cI was engaged to him, dear, for seven\r\nyears, and then he died.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica made a sympathetic little murmur.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was in holy orders, and we were to have been married when he got a\r\nliving. He was a Wiltshire Edmondshaw, a very old family.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe sat very still.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica hesitated with a question that had leaped up in her mind,\r\nand that she felt was cruel. \u201cAre you sorry you waited, aunt?\u201d she said.\r\n\r\nHer aunt was a long time before she answered. \u201cHis stipend forbade it,\u201d\r\n she said, and seemed to fall into a train of thought. \u201cIt would have\r\nbeen rash and unwise,\u201d she said at the end of a meditation. \u201cWhat he had\r\nwas altogether insufficient.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica looked at the mildly pensive gray eyes and the comfortable,\r\nrather refined face with a penetrating curiosity. Presently her aunt\r\nsighed deeply and looked at the clock. \u201cTime for my Patience,\u201d she said.\r\nShe got up, put the neat cuffs she had made into her work-basket,\r\nand went to the bureau for the little cards in the morocco case. Ann\r\nVeronica jumped up to get her the card-table. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the new\r\nPatience, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cMay I sit beside you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult one,\u201d said her aunt. \u201cPerhaps you will help me\r\nshuffle?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica did, and also assisted nimbly with the arrangements of the\r\nrows of eight with which the struggle began. Then she sat watching the\r\nplay, sometimes offering a helpful suggestion, sometimes letting her\r\nattention wander to the smoothly shining arms she had folded across her\r\nknees just below the edge of the table. She was feeling extraordinarily\r\nwell that night, so that the sense of her body was a deep delight, a\r\nrealization of a gentle warmth and strength and elastic firmness. Then\r\nshe glanced at the cards again, over which her aunt\u2019s many-ringed hand\r\nplayed, and then at the rather weak, rather plump face that surveyed its\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nIt came to Ann Veronica that life was wonderful beyond measure. It\r\nseemed incredible that she and her aunt were, indeed, creatures of the\r\nsame blood, only by a birth or so different beings, and part of that\r\nsame broad interlacing stream of human life that has invented the fauns\r\nand nymphs, Astarte, Aphrodite, Freya, and all the twining beauty of\r\nthe gods. The love-songs of all the ages were singing in her blood, the\r\nscent of night stock from the garden filled the air, and the moths that\r\nbeat upon the closed frames of the window next the lamp set her mind\r\ndreaming of kisses in the dusk. Yet her aunt, with a ringed hand\r\nflitting to her lips and a puzzled, worried look in her eyes, deaf\r\nto all this riot of warmth and flitting desire, was playing\r\nPatience--playing Patience, as if Dionysius and her curate had died\r\ntogether. A faint buzz above the ceiling witnessed that petrography,\r\ntoo, was active. Gray and tranquil world! Amazing, passionless world! A\r\nworld in which days without meaning, days in which \u201cwe don\u2019t want things\r\nto happen\u201d followed days without meaning--until the last thing happened,\r\nthe ultimate, unavoidable, coarse, \u201cdisagreeable.\u201d It was her last\r\nevening in that wrappered life against which she had rebelled. Warm\r\nreality was now so near her she could hear it beating in her ears. Away\r\nin London even now Capes was packing and preparing; Capes, the magic man\r\nwhose touch turned one to trembling fire. What was he doing? What was he\r\nthinking? It was less than a day now, less than twenty hours. Seventeen\r\nhours, sixteen hours. She glanced at the soft-ticking clock with the\r\nexposed brass pendulum upon the white marble mantel, and made a rapid\r\ncalculation. To be exact, it was just sixteen hours and twenty minutes.\r\nThe slow stars circled on to the moment of their meeting. The softly\r\nglittering summer stars! She saw them shining over mountains of snow,\r\nover valleys of haze and warm darkness.... There would be no moon.\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe after all it\u2019s coming out!\u201d said Miss Stanley. \u201cThe aces made\r\nit easy.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica started from her reverie, sat up in her chair, became\r\nattentive. \u201cLook, dear,\u201d she said presently, \u201cyou can put the ten on the\r\nJack.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SIXTEENTH\r\n\r\nIN THE MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 1\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day Ann Veronica and Capes felt like newborn things. It seemed\r\nto them they could never have been really alive before, but only\r\ndimly anticipating existence. They sat face to face beneath an\r\nexperienced-looking rucksack and a brand new portmanteau and a leather\r\nhandbag, in the afternoon-boat train that goes from Charing Cross to\r\nFolkestone for Boulogne. They tried to read illustrated papers in an\r\nunconcerned manner and with forced attention, lest they should catch\r\nthe leaping exultation in each other\u2019s eyes. And they admired Kent\r\nsedulously from the windows.\r\n\r\nThey crossed the Channel in sunshine and a breeze that just ruffled the\r\nsea to glittering scales of silver. Some of the people who watched them\r\nstanding side by side thought they must be newly wedded because of their\r\nhappy faces, and others that they were an old-established couple because\r\nof their easy confidence in each other.\r\n\r\nAt Boulogne they took train to Basle; next morning they breakfasted\r\ntogether in the buffet of that station, and thence they caught the\r\nInterlaken express, and so went by way of Spies to Frutigen. There was\r\nno railway beyond Frutigen in those days; they sent their baggage by\r\npost to Kandersteg, and walked along the mule path to the left of the\r\nstream to that queer hollow among the precipices, Blau See, where the\r\npetrifying branches of trees lie in the blue deeps of an icy lake, and\r\npine-trees clamber among gigantic boulders. A little inn flying a\r\nSwiss flag nestles under a great rock, and there they put aside their\r\nknapsacks and lunched and rested in the mid-day shadow of the gorge\r\nand the scent of resin. And later they paddled in a boat above the\r\nmysterious deeps of the See, and peered down into the green-blues and\r\nthe blue-greens together. By that time it seemed to them they had lived\r\ntogether twenty years.\r\n\r\nExcept for one memorable school excursion to Paris, Ann Veronica had\r\nnever yet been outside England. So that it seemed to her the whole world\r\nhad changed--the very light of it had changed. Instead of English villas\r\nand cottages there were chalets and Italian-built houses shining white;\r\nthere were lakes of emerald and sapphire and clustering castles, and\r\nsuch sweeps of hill and mountain, such shining uplands of snow, as she\r\nhad never seen before. Everything was fresh and bright, from the kindly\r\nmanners of the Frutigen cobbler, who hammered mountain nails into her\r\nboots, to the unfamiliar wild flowers that spangled the wayside. And\r\nCapes had changed into the easiest and jolliest companion in the world.\r\nThe mere fact that he was there in the train alongside her, helping her,\r\nsitting opposite to her in the dining-car, presently sleeping on a seat\r\nwithin a yard of her, made her heart sing until she was afraid their\r\nfellow passengers would hear it. It was too good to be true. She would\r\nnot sleep for fear of losing a moment of that sense of his proximity. To\r\nwalk beside him, dressed akin to him, rucksacked and companionable, was\r\nbliss in itself; each step she took was like stepping once more across\r\nthe threshold of heaven.\r\n\r\nOne trouble, however, shot its slanting bolts athwart the shining warmth\r\nof that opening day and marred its perfection, and that was the thought\r\nof her father.\r\n\r\nShe had treated him badly; she had hurt him and her aunt; she had done\r\nwrong by their standards, and she would never persuade them that she\r\nhad done right. She thought of her father in the garden, and of her aunt\r\nwith her Patience, as she had seen them--how many ages was it ago? Just\r\none day intervened. She felt as if she had struck them unawares. The\r\nthought of them distressed her without subtracting at all from the\r\noceans of happiness in which she swam. But she wished she could put the\r\nthing she had done in some way to them so that it would not hurt them\r\nso much as the truth would certainly do. The thought of their faces,\r\nand particularly of her aunt\u2019s, as it would meet the fact--disconcerted,\r\nunfriendly, condemning, pained--occurred to her again and again.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! I wish,\u201d she said, \u201cthat people thought alike about these things.\u201d\r\n\r\nCapes watched the limpid water dripping from his oar. \u201cI wish they did,\u201d\r\n he said, \u201cbut they don\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI feel--All this is the rightest of all conceivable things. I want to\r\ntell every one. I want to boast myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI told them a lie. I told them lies. I wrote three letters yesterday\r\nand tore them up. It was so hopeless to put it to them. At last--I told\r\na story.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell them our position?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI implied we had married.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ll find out. They\u2019ll know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSooner or later.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPossibly--bit by bit.... But it was hopelessly hard to put. I said\r\nI knew he disliked and distrusted you and your work--that you shared\r\nall Russell\u2019s opinions: he hates Russell beyond measure--and that we\r\ncouldn\u2019t possibly face a conventional marriage. What else could one say?\r\nI left him to suppose--a registry perhaps....\u201d\r\n\r\nCapes let his oar smack on the water.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mind very much?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it makes me feel inhuman,\u201d he added.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd me....\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the perpetual trouble,\u201d he said, \u201cof parent and child. They\r\ncan\u2019t help seeing things in the way they do. Nor can we. WE don\u2019t\r\nthink they\u2019re right, but they don\u2019t think we are. A deadlock. In a very\r\ndefinite sense we are in the wrong--hopelessly in the wrong. But--It\u2019s\r\njust this: who was to be hurt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish no one had to be hurt,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cWhen one is happy--I\r\ndon\u2019t like to think of them. Last time I left home I felt as hard as\r\nnails. But this is all different. It is different.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sort of instinct of rebellion,\u201d said Capes. \u201cIt isn\u2019t\r\nanything to do with our times particularly. People think it is, but they\r\nare wrong. It\u2019s to do with adolescence. Long before religion and Society\r\nheard of Doubt, girls were all for midnight coaches and Gretna Green.\r\nIt\u2019s a sort of home-leaving instinct.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe followed up a line of thought.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s another instinct, too,\u201d he went on, \u201cin a state of suppression,\r\nunless I\u2019m very much mistaken; a child-expelling instinct.... I\r\nwonder.... There\u2019s no family uniting instinct, anyhow; it\u2019s habit\r\nand sentiment and material convenience hold families together after\r\nadolescence. There\u2019s always friction, conflict, unwilling concessions.\r\nAlways! I don\u2019t believe there is any strong natural affection at all\r\nbetween parents and growing-up children. There wasn\u2019t, I know, between\r\nmyself and my father. I didn\u2019t allow myself to see things as they were\r\nin those days; now I do. I bored him. I hated him. I suppose that\r\nshocks one\u2019s ideas.... It\u2019s true.... There are sentimental and\r\ntraditional deferences and reverences, I know, between father and\r\nson; but that\u2019s just exactly what prevents the development of an easy\r\nfriendship. Father-worshipping sons are abnormal--and they\u2019re no good.\r\nNo good at all. One\u2019s got to be a better man than one\u2019s father, or what\r\nis the good of successive generations? Life is rebellion, or nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe rowed a stroke and watched the swirl of water from his oar broaden\r\nand die away. At last he took up his thoughts again: \u201cI wonder if, some\r\nday, one won\u2019t need to rebel against customs and laws? If this discord\r\nwill have gone? Some day, perhaps--who knows?--the old won\u2019t coddle and\r\nhamper the young, and the young won\u2019t need to fly in the faces of the\r\nold. They\u2019ll face facts as facts, and understand. Oh, to face facts!\r\nGods! what a world it might be if people faced facts! Understanding!\r\nUnderstanding! There is no other salvation. Some day older people,\r\nperhaps, will trouble to understand younger people, and there won\u2019t\r\nbe these fierce disruptions; there won\u2019t be barriers one must defy or\r\nperish.... That\u2019s really our choice now, defy--or futility.... The\r\nworld, perhaps, will be educated out of its idea of fixed standards....\r\nI wonder, Ann Veronica, if, when our time comes, we shall be any\r\nwiser?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica watched a water-beetle fussing across the green depths.\r\n\u201cOne can\u2019t tell. I\u2019m a female thing at bottom. I like high tone for a\r\nflourish and stars and ideas; but I want my things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\n\r\nCapes thought.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s odd--I have no doubt in my mind that what we are doing is wrong,\u201d\r\n he said. \u201cAnd yet I do it without compunction.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never felt so absolutely right,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou ARE a female thing at bottom,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not nearly so sure\r\nas you. As for me, I look twice at it.... Life is two things,\r\nthat\u2019s how I see it; two things mixed and muddled up together. Life is\r\nmorality--life is adventure. Squire and master. Adventure rules, and\r\nmorality--looks up the trains in the Bradshaw. Morality tells you what\r\nis right, and adventure moves you. If morality means anything it means\r\nkeeping bounds, respecting implications, respecting implicit bounds. If\r\nindividuality means anything it means breaking bounds--adventure.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you be moral and your species, or immoral and yourself? We\u2019ve\r\ndecided to be immoral. We needn\u2019t try and give ourselves airs. We\u2019ve\r\ndeserted the posts in which we found ourselves, cut our duties, exposed\r\nourselves to risks that may destroy any sort of social usefulness in\r\nus.... I don\u2019t know. One keeps rules in order to be one\u2019s self. One\r\nstudies Nature in order not to be blindly ruled by her. There\u2019s no sense\r\nin morality, I suppose, unless you are fundamentally immoral.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe watched his face as he traced his way through these speculative\r\nthickets.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at our affair,\u201d he went on, looking up at her. \u201cNo power on earth\r\nwill persuade me we\u2019re not two rather disreputable persons. You desert\r\nyour home; I throw up useful teaching, risk every hope in your career.\r\nHere we are absconding, pretending to be what we are not; shady, to say\r\nthe least of it. It\u2019s not a bit of good pretending there\u2019s any Higher\r\nTruth or wonderful principle in this business. There isn\u2019t. We never\r\nstarted out in any high-browed manner to scandalize and Shelleyfy.\r\nWhen first you left your home you had no idea that _I_ was the hidden\r\nimpulse. I wasn\u2019t. You came out like an ant for your nuptial flight. It\r\nwas just a chance that we in particular hit against each other--nothing\r\npredestined about it. We just hit against each other, and here we are\r\nflying off at a tangent, a little surprised at what we are doing, all\r\nour principles abandoned, and tremendously and quite unreasonably proud\r\nof ourselves. Out of all this we have struck a sort of harmony....\r\nAnd it\u2019s gorgeous!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGlorious!\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cWould YOU like us--if some one told you the bare outline of our\r\nstory?--and what we are doing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut if some one else asked your advice? If some one else said, \u2018Here is\r\nmy teacher, a jaded married man on the verge of middle age, and he and I\r\nhave a violent passion for one another. We propose to disregard all our\r\nties, all our obligations, all the established prohibitions of society,\r\nand begin life together afresh.\u2019 What would you tell her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf she asked advice, I should say she wasn\u2019t fit to do anything of the\r\nsort. I should say that having a doubt was enough to condemn it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut waive that point.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would be different all the same. It wouldn\u2019t be you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be you either. I suppose that\u2019s the gist of the whole\r\nthing.\u201d He stared at a little eddy. \u201cThe rule\u2019s all right, so long as\r\nthere isn\u2019t a case. Rules are for established things, like the pieces\r\nand positions of a game. Men and women are not established things;\r\nthey\u2019re experiments, all of them. Every human being is a new thing,\r\nexists to do new things. Find the thing you want to do most intensely,\r\nmake sure that\u2019s it, and do it with all your might. If you live, well\r\nand good; if you die, well and good. Your purpose is done.... Well,\r\nthis is OUR thing.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe woke the glassy water to swirling activity again, and made the\r\ndeep-blue shapes below writhe and shiver.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is MY thing,\u201d said Ann Veronica, softly, with thoughtful eyes upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThen she looked up the sweep of pine-trees to the towering sunlit cliffs\r\nand the high heaven above and then back to his face. She drew in a deep\r\nbreath of the sweet mountain air. Her eyes were soft and grave, and\r\nthere was the faintest of smiles upon her resolute lips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3\r\n\r\n\r\nLater they loitered along a winding path above the inn, and made love\r\nto one another. Their journey had made them indolent, the afternoon was\r\nwarm, and it seemed impossible to breathe a sweeter air. The flowers and\r\nturf, a wild strawberry, a rare butterfly, and suchlike little intimate\r\nthings had become more interesting than mountains. Their flitting hands\r\nwere always touching. Deep silences came between them....\r\n\r\n\u201cI had thought to go on to Kandersteg,\u201d said Capes, \u201cbut this is a\r\npleasant place. There is not a soul in the inn but ourselves. Let\r\nus stay the night here. Then we can loiter and gossip to our heart\u2019s\r\ncontent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter all, it\u2019s our honeymoon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll we shall get,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis place is very beautiful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAny place would be beautiful,\u201d said Ann Veronica, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nFor a time they walked in silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d she began, presently, \u201cwhy I love you--and love you so\r\nmuch?... I know now what it is to be an abandoned female. I AM an\r\nabandoned female. I\u2019m not ashamed--of the things I\u2019m doing. I want to\r\nput myself into your hands. You know--I wish I could roll my little body\r\nup small and squeeze it into your hand and grip your fingers upon it.\r\nTight. I want you to hold me and have me SO.... Everything. Everything.\r\nIt\u2019s a pure joy of giving--giving to YOU. I have never spoken of these\r\nthings to any human being. Just dreamed--and ran away even from my\r\ndreams. It is as if my lips had been sealed about them. And now I break\r\nthe seals--for you. Only I wish--I wish to-day I was a thousand times,\r\nten thousand times more beautiful.\u201d\r\n\r\nCapes lifted her hand and kissed it.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are a thousand times more beautiful,\u201d he said, \u201cthan anything else\r\ncould be.... You are you. You are all the beauty in the world. Beauty\r\ndoesn\u2019t mean, never has meant, anything--anything at all but you. It\r\nheralded you, promised you....\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 4\r\n\r\n\r\nThey lay side by side in a shallow nest of turf and mosses among\r\nbowlders and stunted bushes on a high rock, and watched the day sky\r\ndeepen to evening between the vast precipices overhead and looked over\r\nthe tree-tops down the widening gorge. A distant suggestion of chalets\r\nand a glimpse of the road set them talking for a time of the world they\r\nhad left behind.\r\n\r\nCapes spoke casually of their plans for work. \u201cIt\u2019s a flabby,\r\nloose-willed world we have to face. It won\u2019t even know whether to be\r\nscandalized at us or forgiving. It will hold aloof, a little undecided\r\nwhether to pelt or not--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat depends whether we carry ourselves as though we expected pelting,\u201d\r\n said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe won\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo fear!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, as we succeed, it will begin to sidle back to us. It will do its\r\nbest to overlook things--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we let it, poor dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s if we succeed. If we fail,\u201d said Capes, \u201cthen--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to fail,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\nLife seemed a very brave and glorious enterprise to Ann Veronica that\r\nday. She was quivering with the sense of Capes at her side and glowing\r\nwith heroic love; it seemed to her that if they put their hands jointly\r\nagainst the Alps and pushed they would be able to push them aside. She\r\nlay and nibbled at a sprig of dwarf rhododendron.\r\n\r\n\u201cFAIL!\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 5\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently it occurred to Ann Veronica to ask about the journey he had\r\nplanned. He had his sections of the Siegfried map folded in his pocket,\r\nand he squatted up with his legs crossed like an Indian idol while\r\nshe lay prone beside him and followed every movement of his indicatory\r\nfinger.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said, \u201cis this Blau See, and here we rest until to-morrow. I\r\nthink we rest here until to-morrow?\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a brief silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a very pleasant place,\u201d said Ann Veronica, biting a rhododendron\r\nstalk through, and with that faint shadow of a smile returning to her\r\nlips....\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen we go on to this place, the Oeschinensee. It\u2019s a lake among\r\nprecipices, and there is a little inn where we can stay, and sit and eat\r\nour dinner at a pleasant table that looks upon the lake. For some days\r\nwe shall be very idle there among the trees and rocks. There are boats\r\non the lake and shady depths and wildernesses of pine-wood. After a day\r\nor so, perhaps, we will go on one or two little excursions and see how\r\ngood your head is--a mild scramble or so; and then up to a hut on a pass\r\njust here, and out upon the Blumlis-alp glacier that spreads out so and\r\nso.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe roused herself from some dream at the word. \u201cGlaciers?\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cUnder the Wilde Frau--which was named after you.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe bent and kissed her hair and paused, and then forced his attention\r\nback to the map. \u201cOne day,\u201d he resumed, \u201cwe will start off early and\r\ncome down into Kandersteg and up these zigzags and here and here, and so\r\npast this Daubensee to a tiny inn--it won\u2019t be busy yet, though; we\r\nmay get it all to ourselves--on the brim of the steepest zigzag you can\r\nimagine, thousands of feet of zigzag; and you will sit and eat lunch\r\nwith me and look out across the Rhone Valley and over blue distances\r\nbeyond blue distances to the Matterhorn and Monte Rosa and a long\r\nregiment of sunny, snowy mountains. And when we see them we shall at\r\nonce want to go to them--that\u2019s the way with beautiful things--and\r\ndown we shall go, like flies down a wall, to Leukerbad, and so to Leuk\r\nStation, here, and then by train up the Rhone Valley and this little\r\nside valley to Stalden; and there, in the cool of the afternoon, we\r\nshall start off up a gorge, torrents and cliffs below us and above us,\r\nto sleep in a half-way inn, and go on next day to Saas Fee, Saas of\r\nthe Magic, Saas of the Pagan People. And there, about Saas, are ice\r\nand snows again, and sometimes we will loiter among the rocks and trees\r\nabout Saas or peep into Samuel Butler\u2019s chapels, and sometimes we will\r\nclimb up out of the way of the other people on to the glaciers and snow.\r\nAnd, for one expedition at least, we will go up this desolate valley\r\nhere to Mattmark, and so on to Monte Moro. There indeed you see Monte\r\nRosa. Almost the best of all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it very beautiful?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I saw it there it was very beautiful. It was wonderful. It was the\r\ncrowned queen of mountains in her robes of shining white. It towered up\r\nhigh above the level of the pass, thousands of feet, still, shining, and\r\nwhite, and below, thousands of feet below, was a floor of little woolly\r\nclouds. And then presently these clouds began to wear thin and expose\r\nsteep, deep slopes, going down and down, with grass and pine-trees, down\r\nand down, and at last, through a great rent in the clouds, bare roofs,\r\nshining like very minute pin-heads, and a road like a fibre of white\r\nsilk-Macugnana, in Italy. That will be a fine day--it will have to be,\r\nwhen first you set eyes on Italy.... That\u2019s as far as we go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t we go down into Italy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said; \u201cit won\u2019t run to that now. We must wave our hands at the\r\nblue hills far away there and go back to London and work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut Italy--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cItaly\u2019s for a good girl,\u201d he said, and laid his hand for a moment on\r\nher shoulder. \u201cShe must look forward to Italy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI say,\u201d she reflected, \u201cyou ARE rather the master, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe idea struck him as novel. \u201cOf course I\u2019m manager for this\r\nexpedition,\u201d he said, after an interval of self-examination.\r\n\r\nShe slid her cheek down the tweed sleeve of his coat. \u201cNice sleeve,\u201d she\r\nsaid, and came to his hand and kissed it.\r\n\r\n\u201cI say!\u201d he cried. \u201cLook here! Aren\u2019t you going a little too far?\r\nThis--this is degradation--making a fuss with sleeves. You mustn\u2019t do\r\nthings like that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFree woman--and equal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do it--of my own free will,\u201d said Ann Veronica, kissing his hand\r\nagain. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to what I WILL do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, well!\u201d he said, a little doubtfully, \u201cit\u2019s just a phase,\u201d and bent\r\ndown and rested his hand on her shoulder for a moment, with his heart\r\nbeating and his nerves a-quiver. Then as she lay very still, with her\r\nhands clinched and her black hair tumbled about her face, he came still\r\ncloser and softly kissed the nape of her neck....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 6\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the things that he had planned they did. But they climbed more\r\nthan he had intended because Ann Veronica proved rather a good climber,\r\nsteady-headed and plucky, rather daring, but quite willing to be\r\ncautious at his command.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that most surprised him in her was her capacity for\r\nblind obedience. She loved to be told to do things.\r\n\r\nHe knew the circle of mountains about Saas Fee fairly well: he had been\r\nthere twice before, and it was fine to get away from the straggling\r\npedestrians into the high, lonely places, and sit and munch sandwiches\r\nand talk together and do things together that were just a little\r\ndifficult and dangerous. And they could talk, they found; and never\r\nonce, it seemed, did their meaning and intention hitch. They were\r\nenormously pleased with one another; they found each other beyond\r\nmeasure better than they had expected, if only because of the want of\r\nsubstance in mere expectation. Their conversation degenerated again\r\nand again into a strain of self-congratulation that would have irked an\r\neavesdropper.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re--I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cYou\u2019re splendid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t that you\u2019re splendid or I,\u201d said Capes. \u201cBut we satisfy one\r\nanother. Heaven alone knows why. So completely! The oddest fitness!\r\nWhat is it made of? Texture of skin and texture of mind? Complexion and\r\nvoice. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got illusions, nor you.... If I had never\r\nmet anything of you at all but a scrap of your skin binding a book, Ann\r\nVeronica, I know I would have kept that somewhere near to me.... All\r\nyour faults are just jolly modelling to make you real and solid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe faults are the best part of it,\u201d said Ann Veronica; \u201cwhy, even our\r\nlittle vicious strains run the same way. Even our coarseness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCoarse?\u201d said Capes, \u201cWe\u2019re not coarse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut if we were?\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can talk to you and you to me without a scrap of effort,\u201d said\r\nCapes; \u201cthat\u2019s the essence of it. It\u2019s made up of things as small as the\r\ndiameter of hairs and big as life and death.... One always dreamed\r\nof this and never believed it. It\u2019s the rarest luck, the wildest, most\r\nimpossible accident. Most people, every one I know else, seem to have\r\nmated with foreigners and to talk uneasily in unfamiliar tongues, to be\r\nafraid of the knowledge the other one has, of the other one\u2019s perpetual\r\nmisjudgment and misunderstandings.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they wait?\u201d he added.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica had one of her flashes of insight.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne doesn\u2019t wait,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\nShe expanded that. \u201c_I_ shouldn\u2019t have waited,\u201d she said. \u201cI might have\r\nmuddled for a time. But it\u2019s as you say. I\u2019ve had the rarest luck and\r\nfallen on my feet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve both fallen on our feet! We\u2019re the rarest of mortals! The real\r\nthing! There\u2019s not a compromise nor a sham nor a concession between\r\nus. We aren\u2019t afraid; we don\u2019t bother. We don\u2019t consider each other;\r\nwe needn\u2019t. That wrappered life, as you call it--we\u2019ve burned the\r\nconfounded rags! Danced out of it! We\u2019re stark!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStark!\u201d echoed Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 7\r\n\r\n\r\nAs they came back from that day\u2019s climb--it was up the Mittaghorn--they\r\nhad to cross a shining space of wet, steep rocks between two grass\r\nslopes that needed a little care. There were a few loose, broken\r\nfragments of rock to reckon with upon the ledges, and one place where\r\nhands did as much work as toes. They used the rope--not that a rope was\r\nat all necessary, but because Ann Veronica\u2019s exalted state of mind made\r\nthe fact of the rope agreeably symbolical; and, anyhow, it did insure a\r\njoint death in the event of some remotely possibly mischance. Capes went\r\nfirst, finding footholds and, where the drops in the strata-edges came\r\nlike long, awkward steps, placing Ann Veronica\u2019s feet. About half-way\r\nacross this interval, when everything seemed going well, Capes had a\r\nshock.\r\n\r\n\u201cHeavens!\u201d exclaimed Ann Veronica, with extraordinary passion. \u201cMy God!\u201d\r\n and ceased to move.\r\n\r\nCapes became rigid and adhesive. Nothing ensued. \u201cAll right?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to pay it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve forgotten something. Oh, cuss it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe said I would.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the devil of it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDevil of what?... You DO use vile language!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cForget about it like this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cForget WHAT?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I said I wouldn\u2019t. I said I\u2019d do anything. I said I\u2019d make shirts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShirts?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShirts at one--and--something a dozen. Oh, goodness! Bilking! Ann\r\nVeronica, you\u2019re a bilker!\u201d\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you tell me what all this is about?\u201d said Capes.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about forty pounds.\u201d\r\n\r\nCapes waited patiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cG. I\u2019m sorry.... But you\u2019ve got to lend me forty pounds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s some sort of delirium,\u201d said Capes. \u201cThe rarefied air? I thought\r\nyou had a better head.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! I\u2019ll explain lower. It\u2019s all right. Let\u2019s go on climbing now. It\u2019s\r\na thing I\u2019ve unaccountably overlooked. All right really. It can wait\r\na bit longer. I borrowed forty pounds from Mr. Ramage. Thank goodness\r\nyou\u2019ll understand. That\u2019s why I chucked Manning.... All right, I\u2019m\r\ncoming. But all this business has driven it clean out of my head....\r\nThat\u2019s why he was so annoyed, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho was annoyed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Ramage--about the forty pounds.\u201d She took a step. \u201cMy dear,\u201d she\r\nadded, by way of afterthought, \u201cyou DO obliterate things!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 8\r\n\r\n\r\nThey found themselves next day talking love to one another high up on\r\nsome rocks above a steep bank of snow that overhung a precipice on the\r\neastern side of the Fee glacier. By this time Capes\u2019 hair had bleached\r\nnearly white, and his skin had become a skin of red copper shot with\r\ngold. They were now both in a state of unprecedented physical fitness.\r\nAnd such skirts as Ann Veronica had had when she entered the valley of\r\nSaas were safely packed away in the hotel, and she wore a leather belt\r\nand loose knickerbockers and puttees--a costume that suited the fine,\r\nlong lines of her limbs far better than any feminine walking-dress could\r\ndo. Her complexion had resisted the snow-glare wonderfully; her skin had\r\nonly deepened its natural warmth a little under the Alpine sun. She had\r\npushed aside her azure veil, taken off her snow-glasses, and sat smiling\r\nunder her hand at the shining glories--the lit cornices, the blue\r\nshadows, the softly rounded, enormous snow masses, the deep places\r\nfull of quivering luminosity--of the Taschhorn and Dom. The sky was\r\ncloudless, effulgent blue.\r\n\r\nCapes sat watching and admiring her, and then he fell praising the day\r\nand fortune and their love for each other.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere we are,\u201d he said, \u201cshining through each other like light through a\r\nstained-glass window. With this air in our blood, this sunlight soaking\r\nus.... Life is so good. Can it ever be so good again?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica put out a firm hand and squeezed his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s very good,\u201d\r\n she said. \u201cIt\u2019s glorious good!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuppose now--look at this long snow-slope and then that blue deep\r\nbeyond--do you see that round pool of color in the ice--a thousand feet\r\nor more below? Yes? Well, think--we\u2019ve got to go but ten steps and lie\r\ndown and put our arms about each other. See? Down we should rush in a\r\nfoam--in a cloud of snow--to flight and a dream. All the rest of\r\nour lives would be together then, Ann Veronica. Every moment. And no\r\nill-chances.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you tempt me too much,\u201d she said, after a silence, \u201cI shall do\r\nit. I need only just jump up and throw myself upon you. I\u2019m a desperate\r\nyoung woman. And then as we went down you\u2019d try to explain. And that\r\nwould spoil it.... You know you don\u2019t mean it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. But I liked to say it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRather! But I wonder why you don\u2019t mean it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause, I suppose, the other thing is better. What other reason could\r\nthere be? It\u2019s more complex, but it\u2019s better. THIS, this glissade, would\r\nbe damned scoundrelism. You know that, and I know that, though we might\r\nbe put to it to find a reason why. It would be swindling. Drawing the\r\npay of life and then not living. And besides--We\u2019re going to live, Ann\r\nVeronica! Oh, the things we\u2019ll do, the life we\u2019ll lead! There\u2019ll be\r\ntrouble in it at times--you and I aren\u2019t going to run without friction.\r\nBut we\u2019ve got the brains to get over that, and tongues in our heads to\r\ntalk to each other. We sha\u2019n\u2019t hang up on any misunderstanding. Not us.\r\nAnd we\u2019re going to fight that old world down there. That old world that\r\nhad shoved up that silly old hotel, and all the rest of it.... If we\r\ndon\u2019t live it will think we are afraid of it.... Die, indeed! We\u2019re\r\ngoing to do work; we\u2019re going to unfold about each other; we\u2019re going to\r\nhave children.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGirls!\u201d cried Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cBoys!\u201d said Capes.\r\n\r\n\u201cBoth!\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cLots of \u2018em!\u201d\r\n\r\nCapes chuckled. \u201cYou delicate female!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho cares,\u201d said Ann Veronica, \u201cseeing it\u2019s you? Warm, soft little\r\nwonders! Of course I want them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 9\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAll sorts of things we\u2019re going to do,\u201d said Capes; \u201call sorts of times\r\nwe\u2019re going to have. Sooner or later we\u2019ll certainly do something to\r\nclean those prisons you told me about--limewash the underside of life.\r\nYou and I. We can love on a snow cornice, we can love over a pail of\r\nwhitewash. Love anywhere. Anywhere! Moonlight and music--pleasing, you\r\nknow, but quite unnecessary. We met dissecting dogfish.... Do you\r\nremember your first day with me?... Do you indeed remember? The smell\r\nof decay and cheap methylated spirit!... My dear! we\u2019ve had so many\r\nmoments! I used to go over the times we\u2019d had together, the things we\u2019d\r\nsaid--like a rosary of beads. But now it\u2019s beads by the cask--like the\r\nhold of a West African trader. It feels like too much gold-dust clutched\r\nin one\u2019s hand. One doesn\u2019t want to lose a grain. And one must--some of\r\nit must slip through one\u2019s fingers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if it does,\u201d said Ann Veronica. \u201cI don\u2019t care a rap for\r\nremembering. I care for you. This moment couldn\u2019t be better until the\r\nnext moment comes. That\u2019s how it takes me. Why should WE hoard? We\r\naren\u2019t going out presently, like Japanese lanterns in a gale. It\u2019s the\r\npoor dears who do, who know they will, know they can\u2019t keep it up, who\r\nneed to clutch at way-side flowers. And put \u2018em in little books for\r\nremembrance. Flattened flowers aren\u2019t for the likes of us. Moments,\r\nindeed! We like each other fresh and fresh. It isn\u2019t illusions--for us.\r\nWe two just love each other--the real, identical other--all the time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe real, identical other,\u201d said Capes, and took and bit the tip of her\r\nlittle finger.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no delusions, so far as I know,\u201d said Ann Veronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe there is one. If there is, it\u2019s a mere\r\nwrapping--there\u2019s better underneath. It\u2019s only as if I\u2019d begun to know\r\nyou the day before yesterday or there-abouts. You keep on coming truer,\r\nafter you have seemed to come altogether true. You... brick!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 10\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cTo think,\u201d he cried, \u201cyou are ten years younger than I!... There are\r\ntimes when you make me feel a little thing at your feet--a young, silly,\r\nprotected thing. Do you know, Ann Veronica, it is all a lie about your\r\nbirth certificate; a forgery--and fooling at that. You are one of the\r\nImmortals. Immortal! You were in the beginning, and all the men in the\r\nworld who have known what love is have worshipped at your feet. You have\r\nconverted me to--Lester Ward! You are my dear friend, you are a slip of\r\na girl, but there are moments when my head has been on your breast, when\r\nyour heart has been beating close to my ears, when I have known you for\r\nthe goddess, when I have wished myself your slave, when I have wished\r\nthat you could kill me for the joy of being killed by you. You are the\r\nHigh Priestess of Life....\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour priestess,\u201d whispered Ann Veronica, softly. \u201cA silly little\r\npriestess who knew nothing of life at all until she came to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 11\r\n\r\n\r\nThey sat for a time without speaking a word, in an enormous shining\r\nglobe of mutual satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Capes, at length, \u201cwe\u2019ve to go down, Ann Veronica. Life\r\nwaits for us.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stood up and waited for her to move.\r\n\r\n\u201cGods!\u201d cried Ann Veronica, and kept him standing. \u201cAnd to think that\r\nit\u2019s not a full year ago since I was a black-hearted rebel school-girl,\r\ndistressed, puzzled, perplexed, not understanding that this great\r\nforce of love was bursting its way through me! All those nameless\r\ndiscontents--they were no more than love\u2019s birth-pangs. I felt--I\r\nfelt living in a masked world. I felt as though I had bandaged eyes. I\r\nfelt--wrapped in thick cobwebs. They blinded me. They got in my mouth.\r\nAnd now--Dear! Dear! The dayspring from on high hath visited me. I love.\r\nI am loved. I want to shout! I want to sing! I am glad! I am glad to be\r\nalive because you are alive! I am glad to be a woman because you are a\r\nman! I am glad! I am glad! I am glad! I thank God for life and you. I\r\nthank God for His sunlight on your face. I thank God for the beauty\r\nyou love and the faults you love. I thank God for the very skin that is\r\npeeling from your nose, for all things great and small that make us what\r\nwe are. This is grace I am saying! Oh! my dear! all the joy and weeping\r\nof life are mixed in me now and all the gratitude. Never a new-born\r\ndragon-fly that spread its wings in the morning has felt as glad as I!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SEVENTEENTH\r\n\r\nIN PERSPECTIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 1\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout four years and a quarter later--to be exact, it was four years and\r\nfour months--Mr. and Mrs. Capes stood side by side upon an old Persian\r\ncarpet that did duty as a hearthrug in the dining-room of their flat\r\nand surveyed a shining dinner-table set for four people, lit by\r\nskilfully-shaded electric lights, brightened by frequent gleams of\r\nsilver, and carefully and simply adorned with sweet-pea blossom. Capes\r\nhad altered scarcely at all during the interval, except for a new\r\nquality of smartness in the cut of his clothes, but Ann Veronica was\r\nnearly half an inch taller; her face was at once stronger and softer,\r\nher neck firmer and rounder, and her carriage definitely more womanly\r\nthan it had been in the days of her rebellion. She was a woman now to\r\nthe tips of her fingers; she had said good-bye to her girlhood in the\r\nold garden four years and a quarter ago. She was dressed in a simple\r\nevening gown of soft creamy silk, with a yoke of dark old embroidery\r\nthat enhanced the gentle gravity of her style, and her black hair flowed\r\noff her open forehead to pass under the control of a simple ribbon of\r\nsilver. A silver necklace enhanced the dusky beauty of her neck. Both\r\nhusband and wife affected an unnatural ease of manner for the benefit of\r\nthe efficient parlor-maid, who was putting the finishing touches to the\r\nsideboard arrangements.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt looks all right,\u201d said Capes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think everything\u2019s right,\u201d said Ann Veronica, with the roaming eye of\r\na capable but not devoted house-mistress.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder if they will seem altered,\u201d she remarked for the third time.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere I can\u2019t help,\u201d said Capes.\r\n\r\nHe walked through a wide open archway, curtained with deep-blue\r\ncurtains, into the apartment that served as a reception-room. Ann\r\nVeronica, after a last survey of the dinner appointments, followed him,\r\nrustling, came to his side by the high brass fender, and touched two or\r\nthree ornaments on the mantel above the cheerful fireplace.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a marvel to me that we are to be forgiven,\u201d she said,\r\nturning.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy charm of manner, I suppose. But, indeed, he\u2019s very human.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you tell him of the registry office?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo--o--certainly not so emphatically as I did about the play.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was an inspiration--your speaking to him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI felt impudent. I believe I am getting impudent. I had not been near\r\nthe Royal Society since--since you disgraced me. What\u2019s that?\u201d\r\n\r\nThey both stood listening. It was not the arrival of the guests, but\r\nmerely the maid moving about in the hall.\r\n\r\n\u201cWonderful man!\u201d said Ann Veronica, reassured, and stroking his cheek\r\nwith her finger.\r\n\r\nCapes made a quick movement as if to bite that aggressive digit, but it\r\nwithdrew to Ann Veronica\u2019s side.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was really interested in his stuff. I WAS talking to him before I saw\r\nhis name on the card beside the row of microscopes. Then, naturally, I\r\nwent on talking. He--he has rather a poor opinion of his contemporaries.\r\nOf course, he had no idea who I was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how did you tell him? You\u2019ve never told me. Wasn\u2019t it--a little bit\r\nof a scene?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! let me see. I said I hadn\u2019t been at the Royal Society soiree for\r\nfour years, and got him to tell me about some of the fresh Mendelian\r\nwork. He loves the Mendelians because he hates all the big names of\r\nthe eighties and nineties. Then I think I remarked that science was\r\ndisgracefully under-endowed, and confessed I\u2019d had to take to\r\nmore profitable courses. \u2018The fact of it is,\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m the new\r\nplaywright, Thomas More. Perhaps you\u2019ve heard--?\u2019 Well, you know, he\r\nhad.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFame!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it? \u2018I\u2019ve not seen your play, Mr. More,\u2019 he said, \u2018but I\u2019m told\r\nit\u2019s the most amusing thing in London at the present time. A friend\r\nof mine, Ogilvy\u2019--I suppose that\u2019s Ogilvy & Ogilvy, who do so many\r\ndivorces, Vee?--\u2018was speaking very highly of it--very highly!\u2019\u201d He\r\nsmiled into her eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are developing far too retentive a memory for praises,\u201d said Ann\r\nVeronica.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m still new to them. But after that it was easy. I told him instantly\r\nand shamelessly that the play was going to be worth ten thousand pounds.\r\nHe agreed it was disgraceful. Then I assumed a rather portentous manner\r\nto prepare him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow? Show me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t be portentous, dear, when you\u2019re about. It\u2019s my other side of\r\nthe moon. But I was portentous, I can assure you. \u2018My name\u2019s NOT More,\r\nMr. Stanley,\u2019 I said. \u2018That\u2019s my pet name.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think--yes, I went on in a pleasing blend of the casual and sotto\r\nvoce, \u2018The fact of it is, sir, I happen to be your son-in-law, Capes. I\r\ndo wish you could come and dine with us some evening. It would make my\r\nwife very happy.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat does any one say to an invitation to dinner point-blank? One tries\r\nto collect one\u2019s wits. \u2018She is constantly thinking of you,\u2019 I said.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd he accepted meekly?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPractically. What else could he do? You can\u2019t kick up a scene on the\r\nspur of the moment in the face of such conflicting values as he\r\nhad before him. With me behaving as if everything was infinitely\r\nmatter-of-fact, what could he do? And just then Heaven sent old\r\nManningtree--I didn\u2019t tell you before of the fortunate intervention of\r\nManningtree, did I? He was looking quite infernally distinguished, with\r\na wide crimson ribbon across him--what IS a wide crimson ribbon? Some\r\nsort of knight, I suppose. He is a knight. \u2018Well, young man,\u2019 he said,\r\n\u2018we haven\u2019t seen you lately,\u2019 and something about \u2018Bateson & Co.\u2019--he\u2019s\r\nfrightfully anti-Mendelian--having it all their own way. So I introduced\r\nhim to my father-in-law like a shot. I think that WAS decision. Yes, it\r\nwas Manningtree really secured your father. He--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere they are!\u201d said Ann Veronica as the bell sounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\n\r\nThey received the guests in their pretty little hall with genuine\r\neffusion. Miss Stanley threw aside a black cloak to reveal a discreet\r\nand dignified arrangement of brown silk, and then embraced Ann Veronica\r\nwith warmth. \u201cSo very clear and cold,\u201d she said. \u201cI feared we might\r\nhave a fog.\u201d The housemaid\u2019s presence acted as a useful restraint. Ann\r\nVeronica passed from her aunt to her father, and put her arms about him\r\nand kissed his cheek. \u201cDear old daddy!\u201d she said, and was amazed to\r\nfind herself shedding tears. She veiled her emotion by taking off his\r\novercoat. \u201cAnd this is Mr. Capes?\u201d she heard her aunt saying.\r\n\r\nAll four people moved a little nervously into the drawing-room,\r\nmaintaining a sort of fluttered amiability of sound and movement.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanley professed a great solicitude to warm his hands. \u201cQuite\r\nunusually cold for the time of year,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything very nice,\r\nI am sure,\u201d Miss Stanley murmured to Capes as he steered her to a place\r\nupon the little sofa before the fire. Also she made little pussy-like\r\nsounds of a reassuring nature.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd let\u2019s have a look at you, Vee!\u201d said Mr. Stanley, standing up with\r\na sudden geniality and rubbing his hands together.\r\n\r\nAnn Veronica, who knew her dress became her, dropped a curtsy to her\r\nfather\u2019s regard.\r\n\r\nHappily they had no one else to wait for, and it heartened her mightily\r\nto think that she had ordered the promptest possible service of the\r\ndinner. Capes stood beside Miss Stanley, who was beaming unnaturally,\r\nand Mr. Stanley, in his effort to seem at ease, took entire possession\r\nof the hearthrug.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou found the flat easily?\u201d said Capes in the pause. \u201cThe numbers are a\r\nlittle difficult to see in the archway. They ought to put a lamp.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer father declared there had been no difficulty.\r\n\r\n\u201cDinner is served, m\u2019m,\u201d said the efficient parlor-maid in the archway,\r\nand the worst was over.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, daddy,\u201d said Ann Veronica, following her husband and Miss\r\nStanley; and in the fulness of her heart she gave a friendly squeeze to\r\nthe parental arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent fellow!\u201d he answered a little irrelevantly. \u201cI didn\u2019t\r\nunderstand, Vee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite charming apartments,\u201d Miss Stanley admired; \u201ccharming! Everything\r\nis so pretty and convenient.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dinner was admirable as a dinner; nothing went wrong, from the\r\ngolden and excellent clear soup to the delightful iced marrons\r\nand cream; and Miss Stanley\u2019s praises died away to an appreciative\r\nacquiescence. A brisk talk sprang up between Capes and Mr. Stanley, to\r\nwhich the two ladies subordinated themselves intelligently. The\r\nburning topic of the Mendelian controversy was approached on one or two\r\noccasions, but avoided dexterously; and they talked chiefly of letters\r\nand art and the censorship of the English stage. Mr. Stanley was\r\ninclined to think the censorship should be extended to the supply of\r\nwhat he styled latter-day fiction; good wholesome stories were being\r\nousted, he said, by \u201cvicious, corrupting stuff\u201d that \u201cleft a bad taste\r\nin the mouth.\u201d He declared that no book could be satisfactory that left\r\na bad taste in the mouth, however much it seized and interested the\r\nreader at the time. He did not like it, he said, with a significant\r\nlook, to be reminded of either his books or his dinners after he had\r\ndone with them. Capes agreed with the utmost cordiality.\r\n\r\n\u201cLife is upsetting enough, without the novels taking a share,\u201d said Mr.\r\nStanley.\r\n\r\nFor a time Ann Veronica\u2019s attention was diverted by her aunt\u2019s interest\r\nin the salted almonds.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite particularly nice,\u201d said her aunt. \u201cExceptionally so.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen Ann Veronica could attend again she found the men were discussing\r\nthe ethics of the depreciation of house property through the increasing\r\ntumult of traffic in the West End, and agreeing with each other to a\r\ndevastating extent. It came into her head with real emotional force that\r\nthis must be some particularly fantastic sort of dream. It seemed to her\r\nthat her father was in some inexplicable way meaner-looking than she\r\nhad supposed, and yet also, as unaccountably, appealing. His tie had\r\ndemanded a struggle; he ought to have taken a clean one after his\r\nfirst failure. Why was she noting things like this? Capes seemed\r\nself-possessed and elaborately genial and commonplace, but she knew him\r\nto be nervous by a little occasional clumsiness, by the faintest shadow\r\nof vulgarity in the urgency of his hospitality. She wished he could\r\nsmoke and dull his nerves a little. A gust of irrational impatience blew\r\nthrough her being. Well, they\u2019d got to the pheasants, and in a little\r\nwhile he would smoke. What was it she had expected? Surely her moods\r\nwere getting a little out of hand.\r\n\r\nShe wished her father and aunt would not enjoy their dinner with such\r\nquiet determination. Her father and her husband, who had both been a\r\nlittle pale at their first encounter, were growing now just faintly\r\nflushed. It was a pity people had to eat food.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d said her father, \u201cI have read at least half the novels that\r\nhave been at all successful during the last twenty years. Three a week\r\nis my allowance, and, if I get short ones, four. I change them in the\r\nmorning at Cannon Street, and take my book as I come down.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt occurred to her that she had never seen her father dining out\r\nbefore, never watched him critically as an equal. To Capes he was almost\r\ndeferential, and she had never seen him deferential in the old time,\r\nnever. The dinner was stranger than she had ever anticipated. It was\r\nas if she had grown right past her father into something older and\r\nof infinitely wider outlook, as if he had always been unsuspectedly a\r\nflattened figure, and now she had discovered him from the other side.\r\n\r\nIt was a great relief to arrive at last at that pause when she could say\r\nto her aunt, \u201cNow, dear?\u201d and rise and hold back the curtain through the\r\narchway. Capes and her father stood up, and her father made a belated\r\nmovement toward the curtain. She realized that he was the sort of man\r\none does not think much about at dinners. And Capes was thinking that\r\nhis wife was a supremely beautiful woman. He reached a silver cigar and\r\ncigarette box from the sideboard and put it before his father-in-law,\r\nand for a time the preliminaries of smoking occupied them both. Then\r\nCapes flittered to the hearthrug and poked the fire, stood up, and\r\nturned about. \u201cAnn Veronica is looking very well, don\u2019t you think?\u201d he\r\nsaid, a little awkwardly.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery,\u201d said Mr. Stanley. \u201cVery,\u201d and cracked a walnut appreciatively.\r\n\r\n\u201cLife--things--I don\u2019t think her prospects now--Hopeful outlook.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were in a difficult position,\u201d Mr. Stanley pronounced, and seemed\r\nto hesitate whether he had not gone too far. He looked at his port wine\r\nas though that tawny ruby contained the solution of the matter. \u201cAll\u2019s\r\nwell that ends well,\u201d he said; \u201cand the less one says about things the\r\nbetter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Capes, and threw a newly lit cigar into the fire\r\nthrough sheer nervousness. \u201cHave some more port wine, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very sound wine,\u201d said Mr. Stanley, consenting with dignity.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnn Veronica has never looked quite so well, I think,\u201d said Capes,\r\nclinging, because of a preconceived plan, to the suppressed topic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last the evening was over, and Capes and his wife had gone down to\r\nsee Mr. Stanley and his sister into a taxicab, and had waved an amiable\r\nfarewell from the pavement steps.\r\n\r\n\u201cGreat dears!\u201d said Capes, as the vehicle passed out of sight.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, aren\u2019t they?\u201d said Ann Veronica, after a thoughtful pause. And\r\nthen, \u201cThey seem changed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in out of the cold,\u201d said Capes, and took her arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey seem smaller, you know, even physically smaller,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve grown out of them.... Your aunt liked the pheasant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe liked everything. Did you hear us through the archway, talking\r\ncookery?\u201d\r\n\r\nThey went up by the lift in silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s odd,\u201d said Ann Veronica, re-entering the flat.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s odd?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, everything!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe shivered, and went to the fire and poked it. Capes sat down in the\r\narm-chair beside her.\r\n\r\n\u201cLife\u2019s so queer,\u201d she said, kneeling and looking into the flames. \u201cI\r\nwonder--I wonder if we shall ever get like that.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe turned a firelit face to her husband. \u201cDid you tell him?\u201d\r\n\r\nCapes smiled faintly. \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell--a little clumsily.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI poured him out some port wine, and I said--let me see--oh, \u2018You are\r\ngoing to be a grandfather!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Was he pleased?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCalmly! He said--you won\u2019t mind my telling you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Poor Alice has got no end!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlice\u2019s are different,\u201d said Ann Veronica, after an interval. \u201cQuite\r\ndifferent. She didn\u2019t choose her man.... Well, I told aunt....\r\nHusband of mine, I think we have rather overrated the emotional capacity\r\nof those--those dears.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did your aunt say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t even kiss me. She said\u201d--Ann Veronica shivered again--\u201c\u2018I\r\nhope it won\u2019t make you uncomfortable, my dear\u2019--like that--\u2018and\r\nwhatever you do, do be careful of your hair!\u2019 I think--I judge from\r\nher manner--that she thought it was just a little indelicate of\r\nus--considering everything; but she tried to be practical and\r\nsympathetic and live down to our standards.\u201d\r\n\r\nCapes looked at his wife\u2019s unsmiling face.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour father,\u201d he said, \u201cremarked that all\u2019s well that ends well, and\r\nthat he was disposed to let bygones be bygones. He then spoke with a\r\ncertain fatherly kindliness of the past....\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd my heart has ached for him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no doubt it cut him at the time. It must have cut him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe might even have--given it up for them!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder if we could.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose all IS well that ends well. Somehow to-night--I don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose so. I\u2019m glad the old sore is assuaged. Very glad. But if we\r\nhad gone under--!\u201d\r\n\r\nThey regarded one another silently, and Ann Veronica had one of her\r\npenetrating flashes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are not the sort that goes under,\u201d said Ann Veronica, holding her\r\nhands so that the red reflections vanished from her eyes. \u201cWe settled\r\nlong ago--we\u2019re hard stuff. We\u2019re hard stuff!\u201d\r\n\r\nThen she went on: \u201cTo think that is my father! Oh, my dear! He stood\r\nover me like a cliff; the thought of him nearly turned me aside from\r\neverything we have done. He was the social order; he was law and wisdom.\r\nAnd they come here, and they look at our furniture to see if it is good;\r\nand they are not glad, it does not stir them, that at last, at last we\r\ncan dare to have children.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe dropped back into a crouching attitude and began to weep. \u201cOh,\r\nmy dear!\u201d she cried, and suddenly flung herself, kneeling, into her\r\nhusband\u2019s arms.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you remember the mountains? Do you remember how we loved one\r\nanother? How intensely we loved one another! Do you remember the light\r\non things and the glory of things? I\u2019m greedy, I\u2019m greedy! I want\r\nchildren like the mountains and life like the sky. Oh! and love--love!\r\nWe\u2019ve had so splendid a time, and fought our fight and won. And it\u2019s\r\nlike the petals falling from a flower. Oh, I\u2019ve loved love, dear! I\u2019ve\r\nloved love and you, and the glory of you; and the great time is over,\r\nand I have to go carefully and bear children, and--take care of my\r\nhair--and when I am done with that I shall be an old woman. The petals\r\nhave fallen--the red petals we loved so. We\u2019re hedged about with\r\ndiscretions--and all this furniture--and successes! We are successful\r\nat last! Successful! But the mountains, dear! We won\u2019t forget the\r\nmountains, dear, ever. That shining slope of snow, and how we talked of\r\ndeath! We might have died! Even when we are old, when we are rich as we\r\nmay be, we won\u2019t forget the tune when we cared nothing for anything but\r\nthe joy of one another, when we risked everything for one another, when\r\nall the wrappings and coverings seemed to have fallen from life and left\r\nit light and fire. Stark and stark! Do you remember it all?... Say\r\nyou will never forget! That these common things and secondary things\r\nsha\u2019n\u2019t overwhelm us. These petals! I\u2019ve been wanting to cry all the\r\nevening, cry here on your shoulder for my petals. Petals!... Silly\r\nwoman!... I\u2019ve never had these crying fits before....\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBlood of my heart!\u201d whispered Capes, holding her close to him. \u201cI know.\r\nI understand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Ann Veronica, by H.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\u2019s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\u2019s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\r\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\u2019s web site and official\r\npage at http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n"
