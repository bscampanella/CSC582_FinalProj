While there his mother\r\ntook him one day with her to see a collection of art photographs. He\r\nlooked at them quietly and thoughtfully for a time, and then picking\r\nup a copy of the above picture he said, \"Mamma, you told me I might\r\ntake a present home to Miss Harrison, and I would like to take her\r\nthis picture, because it looks just as I think the little Christ Child\r\nthat she read us about must have looked.\"\r\n\r\nSo beautiful was the thought embodied in the story that it left the\r\nsame impression upon the mind of the child that the great artist\r\nMurillo had left upon canvas. This is but one instance that great\r\nthoughts do make impressions upon the mind of the child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS-TIDE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nELIZABETH HARRISON\r\n\r\nCO-PRINCIPAL OF THE CHICAGO KINDERGARTEN COLLEGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED BY\r\nCHICAGO KINDERGARTEN COLLEGE\r\n10 VAN BUREN STREET\r\nCHICAGO\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHTED 1902\r\nBY\r\nELIZABETH HARRISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    DEDICATED TO MY FATHER\r\n    FROM WHOSE HEART AND LIFE AGE CANNOT\r\n    BANISH THE\r\n    PERPETUAL CHRISTMAS-TIDE\r\n\r\n    --E.

Remember a few good toys, like a few good books,\r\nare far better than many poor toys. Toys in which the child's own\r\ncreative power has full play are far better than the finished toys\r\nfrom the French manufacturers. In fact, too complex a toy is like too\r\nhighly seasoned food, too elaborately written books, too old society,\r\nor any other mature thing forced upon the immature mind. Your choice\r\nshould be based, not so much on _what the toy is, as on what the child\r\ncan do with it_. The instinctive delight of putting their own thought\r\ninto their play-things instead of accepting the thought of the\r\nmanufacturer explains why simple toys are often more pleasing to\r\nchildren than expensive ones.\r\n\r\nThe following list has been compiled from such toys as have delighted\r\nas well as have helped the children of kindergarten-trained mothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TOYS FOR CHILDREN FROM ONE TO TWO YEARS OF AGE.\r\n\r\n    Linen picture-books, rubber animals, cotton-flannel animals, rubber\r\n    rings, worsted balls, strings of spools, knit dolls, rag dolls,\r\n    rubber dolls, wooden animals (unpainted), new silver dollars.\r\n\r\nThe kindergarten materials helpful at this period of the child's\r\ndevelopment are the soft worsted balls of the first gift. When the\r\nchild begins to listen to sounds and to attempt to articulate, the\r\nsphere, cube, and cylinder of the second gift may be given to him.\r\nThese two gifts, when rightly used, assist the clear, distinct, and\r\nnormal growth of the powers of observation and aid the little one in\r\nexpressing himself, even before he has language at his command. Songs\r\nand games illustrative of the various ways in which these gifts can be\r\nused with a young child, are to be found in the Kindergarten Guides\r\nnow published. Some very good ones are included in the first year's\r\ncourse of study for mothers of the Kindergarten College. However,\r\nalmost any mother can invent plays with them for her child.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe kindergarten materials found most helpful for this period of the\r\naverage child's growth are the second gift and the divided cubes of\r\nthe third gift. With the latter the child can early be trained into\r\nhabits of _constructive_ play, rather than _destructive_ play. As all\r\nchildren like to transform and rearrange their toys, this gift is\r\nparticularly adapted to that purpose. It is simple and easy to handle.\r\nMuch logical training can be given the child by teaching him to change\r\none form made with his blocks into another, without scattering, or\r\nentirely destroying the first form. Many suggestive forms may also be\r\nfound in the various Kindergarten Guides already published. A series\r\nof these are now being prepared by the College for general sale.\r\nHowever, the child himself will oftentimes name the forms made by some\r\nname of his own, which should be accepted by the mother. The wooden\r\ntablets, sticks, rings, and points of the kindergarten can also be\r\nused with a child from three to four years of age though they are, as\r\na rule, less satisfactory than the blocks. The second gift beads\r\nfurnish an almost exhaustless amusement for some children at this\r\nstage of their growth. A long linen shoe-string with a firm knot tied\r\nat one end has been found to be the most serviceable kind of a string\r\non which to string the beads. Knowledge of color, form, and number are\r\nalso incidentally taught the child by these beads.\r\n\r\nLow sand tables are an almost endless pleasure to small children, as\r\nsand is one of the most easily mastered of the materials of nature,\r\nand can serve as a surface for the first efforts at drawing, or can be\r\nthe beginning of the childish attempts to mold the solid forms about\r\nhim. When lightly dampened it serves as an excellent substance on\r\nwhich to leave the impress of various objects of interest. In fact,\r\nthere is scarcely any play in which the sand may not take part. The\r\nchild should be taught from the very beginning that he must not spill\r\nthe sand upon the floor nor throw it at any one. In case he violates\r\nthese laws of neatness and safety, the sand table may be removed for a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nA blackboard and chalk are usually a source of much keen and innocent\r\nenjoyment to three and four year old children, especially if the\r\nmother sometimes enters into the making of pictures, or story-telling\r\nby means of pictures, no matter how crudely drawn. Various other\r\nkindergarten \"occupations\" may be used by the trained mother--but the\r\nuntrained mother often finds them confusing and of little use.\r\n\r\nWhenever it is possible the back yard should have a sand pile, a load\r\nof kindling, and a swing in it, that the child in his instinctive\r\ndesire to master material, to construct, and to be free, may find\r\nthese convenient friends to help him in his laudable aspirations. The\r\nstreet has less temptations for children thus provided for.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TOYS FOR CHILDREN FROM THREE TO FIVE YEARS OF AGE.\r\n\r\n    Blackboard and crayon, building blocks, balls, train of cars, doll\r\n    and cradle, wooden beads to string, small glass beads to string,\r\n    rocking-chair, doll's carriage, books with pictures of trade life,\r\n    flowers, vegetables, etc., tracing cards and paper dolls, toy\r\n    poultry yard with fences, trees, a woman, and a dozen ducks and\r\n    chickens.\r\n\r\nThe more advanced gifts of the kindergarten now interest the child.\r\nClay modeling and paper folding can easily be taught him, and many of\r\nthe simpler formulas for the mat weaving, also some of the sewing. A\r\ngood kindergarten is the best play ground for a child at this stage of\r\nhis development, as he _needs_ comrades of his own age and ability. If\r\na kindergarten cannot be had the mother must be as nearly a child\r\nherself as she knows how to be. Good, simple, wholesome stories now\r\nbecome a part of the child's life. They form the door by which he is\r\nlater to be led into the great world of literature. Therefore,\r\nstory-books may be numbered among the suitable toys for four and five\r\nyear old children, though stories _told_ to the child are better.\r\nAlmost any mother who has her child's best interests at heart can\r\nsimplify the old Greek myths as retold by Hawthorne in his \"Wonder\r\nBook,\" or the Norse legends as given us by Hamilton Mabie in \"Norse\r\nStories,\" or the rich, pithy experience of the Teutonic peoples as\r\ncollected in Grimm's \"Fairy Tales.\" All of these contain the seeds of\r\nwisdom which the early child races stored away in childish forms, and\r\ntherefore, they delight the heart of the child of to-day and aid\r\nmaterially in cultivating his imagination in the right way.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TOYS FOR CHILDREN FROM FIVE TO SIX YEARS OF AGE.\r\n\r\n    Kitchen, laundry and baking sets, balls, building blocks, picture\r\n    puzzles, dissecting maps, historical story-books, outline\r\n    picture-books to color with paint or crayon, trumpet, music-box,\r\n    desk, blackboard, wagon, whip, sled, kite, pipe for soap bubbles,\r\n    train of cars, carpenter tools, jackstraws, hobby-horses,\r\n    substantial cook-stove, sand table, skates, rubber boots, broom,\r\n    Richter's stone blocks, shovel, spade, rake and hoe, marbles,\r\n    tops, swing and see-saw, strong milk-wagon equipped with cylinder\r\n    cans, substantial churn, a few bottles filled with water, spices,\r\n    coffee, sugar, etc., for a drug store.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily children of this age still love their kindergarten tools,\r\nand can be led to do really pretty work with their mats, folding,\r\npasting, etc. The fifth and sixth gifts[1] now come into use and aid\r\nthe child in more definite expression of his ideas. More stories\r\nshould be told, and the beginning made of collections of pictures for\r\nscrap-books, also collections of stones, leaves, curios for his own\r\nlittle cabinet. Many references may from time to time be made to the\r\nbooks to be read by and by, which will tell him wonderful things about\r\nthese treasures. In this way a desire to learn to read is awakened,\r\nand soon the world of nature and of books takes the place of toys,\r\nexcept of course, those by means of which bodily skill is gained and\r\ntested. These later belong in general to the period of boyhood and\r\ngirlhood.\r\n\r\n          [1] See \"The Kindergarten Building Gifts\" by Elizabeth\r\n          Harrison and Belle Woodson.\r\n\r\nTo this list of Christmas toys is added a list of books suitable for\r\nChristmas gifts. Very handsome books are to be avoided, as the child\r\ndelights in handling his own books almost as much as his own toys. The\r\nvalue of the right kind of books cannot be too much emphasized. Is not\r\nthe food which you give to your child's mind of as much importance as\r\nthat which you give to his body?\r\n\r\nWhen your boy stops questioning you, he has not stopped questioning\r\nconcerning life and its problems; he has turned to those silent\r\ncompanions which you have placed upon his bookshelf or on the library\r\ntable. Shall heroes and prophets be his counselors, or shall \"Peck's\r\nBad Boy\" and the villain of the dime novel teach him how to look at\r\nlife? _It rests with you._\r\n\r\nThere is a great difference between books which are to be read _to_\r\nchildren, those which are to be read _with_ children, and those which\r\nare to be read _by_ children.\r\n\r\nThe second kind, which are more profitable than the first, require the\r\nmother's sympathetic and genuine interest in the subject-matter in\r\nhand; and frequent stops for little talks about what has been read are\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe third class are books for older children who can read well enough\r\nto peruse them alone; but, if the mother will take time to read them\r\nbefore giving them to the child, she will strengthen the bonds of\r\nintellectual sympathy between herself and him.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LIST No. 1.\r\n\r\n    FOR CHILDREN UNDER SIX YEARS OF AGE.\r\n\r\n    Mother-play and Nursery Song, by Frederick Froebel.\r\n\r\n    Nursery Finger Plays, by Emile Poulsson.\r\n\r\n    Mother Goose, in one syllable.\r\n\r\n    Songs for Little Ones, by Eleanor Smith.\r\n\r\n    \u00c6sop's Fables, in one syllable, by Mary Mapes Dodge.\r\n\r\n    Boley's Own \u00c6sop; illustrated by Walter Crane.\r\n\r\n    Baby World, by Mary Mapes Dodge.\r\n\r\n    Rhymes and Jingles.\r\n\r\n    Little People of the Air, by Olive Thorne Miller.\r\n\r\n    Nonsense Book, by Edward Sears.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LIST No. 2.\r\n\r\n    FOR CHILDREN FROM SIX TO EIGHT YEARS OF AGE.\r\n\r\n    Doll World, by Mrs. O.

Thus we see this most free and\r\ngraceful plaything connected with that free and beautifully developed\r\nnation which has been the admiration of the world ever since. Plato\r\nhas said, \"The plays of children have the mightiest influence on the\r\nmaintenance or non-maintenance of laws\"; and again, \"During earliest\r\nchildhood, the soul of the nursling should be made cheerful and kind,\r\nby keeping away from him sorrow and fear and pain, by soothing him\r\nwith sound of the pipe and of rhythmical movement.\" He still further\r\nadvised that the children should be brought to the temples, and\r\nallowed to play under the supervision of nurses, presumably trained\r\nfor that purpose. Here we see plainly foreshadowed the Kindergarten,\r\nwhose foundation is \"education by play\"; as the study of the\r\nKindergarten system leads to the earnest, thoughtful consideration of\r\nthe office of play, and the exact value which the plaything or toy has\r\nin the development of the child, when this is once understood, the\r\nchoice of what toys to give to children is easily made.\r\n\r\nIn the world of nature, we find the blossom comes before the fruit; in\r\nhistory, art arose long before science was possible; in the human\r\nrace, the emotions are developed sooner than the reason. With the\r\nindividual child it is the same; the childish heart opens\r\nspontaneously in play, the barriers are down, and the loving mother or\r\nthe wise teacher can find entrance into the inner court as in no other\r\nway. The child's _sympathies_ can be attracted towards an object,\r\nperson, or line of conduct much earlier than his reason can grasp any\r\none of them. His emotional nature can and does receive impressions\r\nlong before his intellectual nature is ready for them; in other words,\r\nhe can _love_ before he can _understand_.\r\n\r\nOne of the mistakes of our age is, that we begin by educating our\r\nchildren's _intellects_ rather than their _emotions_. We leave these\r\nall-powerful factors, which give to life its coloring of light or\r\ndarkness, to the oftentimes insufficient training of the ordinary\r\nfamily life--insufficient, owing to its thousand interruptions and\r\npre-occupations. The results are, that many children grow up cold,\r\nhard, matter-of-fact, with little of poetry, sympathy, or ideality to\r\nenrich their lives--mere Gradgrinds in God's world of beauty. We\r\nstarve the healthful emotions of children in order that we may\r\noverfeed their intellects. Is not this doing them a great wrong? When\r\nthe sneering tone is heard, and the question \"Will it pay?\" is the\r\nall-important one, do we not see the result of such training? Possibly\r\nthe unwise training of the emotional nature may give it undue\r\npreponderance, producing morbid sentimentalists, who think that the\r\nNew Testament would be greatly improved if the account of Christ\r\ndriving the money-changers from the temple, or his denunciation of the\r\nPharisees, could be omitted. Such people feed every able-bodied tramp\r\nbrought by chance to their doors, and yet make no effort to lighten\r\nthe burden of the poor sewing-woman of our great cities, who is\r\nworking at almost starvation prices. This is a minor danger, however.\r\nThe education of the heart must advance along with that of the head,\r\nif well-balanced character is to be developed.\r\n\r\nPedagogy tells us that \"_the science of education is the science of\r\ninteresting_\"; and yet, but few pedagogues have realized the\r\nimportance of _educating the interest of the child_. In other words,\r\nlittle or no value has been attached to the likes and dislikes of\r\nchildren; but in reality they are very important.\r\n\r\nA child can be given any quantity of information, he can be made to\r\nget his lessons, he can even be crowded through a series of\r\nexaminations, but that is not _educating_ him. Unless his interest in\r\nthe subject has been awakened, the process has been a failure. _Once\r\nget him thoroughly interested and he can educate himself, along that\r\nline, at least._\r\n\r\nHence the value of toys; they are not only promoters of play, but they\r\nappeal to the sympathies and give exercise to the emotions; in this\r\nway a hold is gotten upon the child, by interesting him before more\r\nintellectual training can make much impression. The two next great\r\nobstacles to the exercise of the right emotions are _fear_ and _pity_;\r\nthese do not come into the toy-world, hence we can see how toys,\r\naccording to their own tendencies, help in the healthful education of\r\nthe child's emotions, through his emotions the education of his\r\nthoughts, through his thoughts the education of his will, and hence\r\nhis character. One can readily see how this is so. By means of their\r\ndolls, wagons, drums, or other toys, children's thoughts are turned in\r\ncertain directions. They play that they are mothers and fathers, or\r\nshop-keepers, or soldiers, as the case may be. Through their dramatic\r\nplay, they become interested more and more in those phases of life\r\nwhich they have imitated, and that which they watch and imitate they\r\nbecome like.\r\n\r\nThe toy-shops of any great city are to him who can read the signs of\r\nthe times, prophecies of the future of that city. They not only\r\npredict the future career of a people, but they tell us of national\r\ntendencies. Seguin, in his report on the educational exhibit at Vienna\r\na few years ago, said: \"The nations which had the most toys had, too,\r\nmore individuality, ideality, and heroism.\" And again: \"The nations\r\nwhich have been made famous by their artists, artisans, and idealists\r\nsupplied their infants with toys.\" It needs but a moment's thought to\r\nrecognize the truth of this statement. Children who have toys exercise\r\ntheir _own_ imagination, put into action their _own ideals_. Ah me,\r\nhow much that means! What ideals have been strangled in the breasts of\r\nmost of us because others did not think as we did! With the toy, an\r\noutline only is drawn; the child must fill in the details. On the\r\nother hand, in story-books the details are given. Both kinds of\r\ntraining are needed: individual development, and participation in the\r\ndevelopment of others--of the world, of the past, of the _All_. With\r\nthis thought of the influence of toys upon the life of nations, a\r\nvisit to any large toy-shop becomes an interesting and curious study.\r\nThe following is the testimony, unconsciously given, by the shelves\r\nand counters in one of the large importing establishments which gather\r\ntogether and send out the playthings of the world. The _French_ toys\r\ninclude nearly all the pewter soldiers, all guns and swords; surely,\r\nsuch would be the toys of the nation which produced a Napoleon. All\r\nPunch and Judy shows are of French manufacture; almost all miniature\r\ntheaters; all doll tea-sets which have wine-glasses and finger-bowls\r\nattached. The French _dolls_ mirror the fashionable world, with all\r\nits finery and unneeded luxury, and hand it down to the little child.\r\nNo wonder Frances Willard made a protest against dolls, if she had in\r\nmind the _French_ doll.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said the guileless saleswoman, as she handed me first one\r\nand then another of these dolls, thinking doubtless that she had a\r\nslow purchaser whom she had to assist in making a selection, \"you can\r\ndress one of these dolls as a lady, or as a little girl, just as you\r\nlike.\" And sure enough, the very baby dolls had upon their faces the\r\nsmile of the society flirt, or the deep, passionate look of the woman\r\nwho had seen the world. I beheld the French Salons of the eighteenth\r\ncentury still lingering in the nineteenth-century dolls. All their\r\ntoys are dainty, artistic, exquisitely put together, but lack strength\r\nand power of endurance, are low or shallow in aim, and are oftentimes\r\ninappropriate in the extreme. For instance, I was shown a Noah's Ark\r\nwith a rose-window of stained glass in one end of it. Do we not see\r\nthe same thing in French literature? Racine's Orestes, bowing and\r\ncomplimenting his Iphigenia, is the same French adornment of the\r\nstrong, simple, Greek story that the pretty window was of the Hebrew\r\nArk.\r\n\r\nThe _German_ toys take another tone. They are heavier, stronger, and\r\nnot so artistic, and largely represent the home and the more primitive\r\nforms of trade-life. From Germany we get all our ready-made\r\ndoll-houses, with their clean tile floors and clumsy porcelain stoves,\r\ntheir parlors with round iron center-tables, and stiff, ugly chairs\r\nwith the inevitable lace tidies. Here and there in these miniature\r\nhouses we see a tiny pot of artificial flowers. All such playthings\r\ntend to draw the child's thoughts to the home life. Next come the\r\ncountless number of toy butcher shops, bakers, blacksmiths, and other\r\nrepresentations of the small, thrifty, healthful trade-life which one\r\nsees all over Germany. Nor is the child's love attracted toward the\r\nhome and the shops alone. Almost all of the better class of toy horses\r\nand carts are of German manufacture. The \"woolly sheep,\" so dear to\r\nchildish heart, is of the same origin. Thus a love for simple,\r\nwholesome out-of-door activities is instilled.\r\n\r\nAnd then the German dolls! One would know from the dolls alone that\r\nGermany was the land of Froebel and the birthplace of the\r\nKindergarten, that it was the country where even the beer-gardens are\r\nsoftened and refined by the family presence. All the regulation\r\nornaments for Christmas trees come from this nation, bringing with\r\nthem memories of Luther; of his breaking away from the celibacy\r\nenjoined by the church; of his entering into the joyous family life,\r\nand trying to bring with him into the home life all that was sacred in\r\nthe church--Christmas festivals along with the rest. Very few firearms\r\ncome from this nation, but among them I saw some strong cast-iron\r\ncannons from Berlin; they looked as if Bismarck himself might have\r\nordered their manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe _Swiss_ toys are largely the bluntly carved wooden cattle, sheep\r\nand goats, with equally blunt shepherds and shepherdesses, reminding\r\none forcibly of the dull faces of those much-enduring beasts of burden\r\ncalled Swiss peasants. I once saw a Swiss girl who had sold to an\r\nAmerican woman, for a few francs, three handkerchiefs, the\r\nembroidering of which had occupied the evenings of her entire winter;\r\nthere was no look of discontent or disgust as the American tossed them\r\ninto her trunk with a lot of other trinkets, utterly oblivious of the\r\namount of human life which had been patiently worked into them. What\r\nkind of toys could come from a people among whom such scenes are\r\naccepted as a matter of course?\r\n\r\nThe _English_ rag doll is particularly national in its placidity of\r\ncountenance. The British people stand pre-eminent in the matter of\r\nstory-books for children, but, so far as I have been able to observe,\r\nare somewhat lacking in originality as to toys; possibly this is due\r\nto the out-of-door life encouraged among them.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked to see the _American_ toys, my guide turned, and with a\r\nsweep of her hand, said: \"These _trunks_ are American. All doll-trunks\r\nare manufactured in this country.\" Surely our Emerson was right when\r\nhe said that \"the tape-worm of travel was in every American.\" Here we\r\nsee the beginning of the restless, migratory spirit of our people;\r\neven these children's toys suggest, \"How nice it would be to pack up\r\nand go somewhere!\" All tool-chests are of domestic origin. Seemingly,\r\nall the inventions of the Yankee mind are reproduced in miniature form\r\nto stimulate the young genius of our country.\r\n\r\nThe _Japanese_ and _Chinese_ toys are a curious study, telling of\r\nnational traits as clearly as do their laws or their religion. They\r\nare endurable, made to last unchanged a long time; no flimsy tinsel is\r\nused which can be admired for the hour, then cast aside. If \"the hand\r\nof Confucius reaches down through twenty-four centuries of time still\r\ngoverning his people,\" so, too, can the carved ivory or inlaid wooden\r\ntoy be used without injury or change by at least one or two successive\r\ngenerations of children.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to the study of the development of the race as a whole,\r\nthat we may the better grasp this thought. The toy not only directs\r\nthe emotional activity of the child, but also forms a bridge between\r\nthe great realities of life and his small capacities. To man was given\r\nthe dominion over the earth, but it was a potential dominion. He had\r\nto conquer the beasts of the field; to develop the resources of the\r\nearth; by his _own effort_ to subordinate all things else unto\r\nhimself. We see the faint foreshadowing, or presentiment, of this in\r\nthe myths and legends of the race. The famous wooden horse of Troy,\r\naccounts of which have come down to us in a dozen different channels\r\nof literature and history, seems to have been the forerunner of the\r\nnineteenth-century bomb, which defies walls and leaps into the enemy's\r\ncamp, scattering death and destruction in every direction. At least,\r\nthe two have the same effect; they speedily put an end to physical\r\nresistance, and bring about consultation and settlement by\r\narbitration. The labors of Hercules tell the same story in another\r\nform--man's power to make nature perform the labors appointed to him;\r\nthe winged sandals of Hermes, Perseus' cloak of invisibility, the\r\narmor of Achilles, and a hundred other charming myths, all tell us of\r\nman's sense of his sovereignty over nature. The old Oriental stories\r\nof the enchanted carpet tell us that the sultan and his court had but\r\nto step upon it, ere it rose majestically and sailed unimpeded through\r\nthe air, and landed its precious freight at the desired destination.\r\nIs not this the dim feeling in the breasts of the childish race that\r\n_man_ ought to have power to transcend space, and by his intelligence\r\ncontrive to convey himself from place to place? Are not our luxurious\r\npalace cars almost fulfilling these early dreams? What are the fairy\r\ntales of the Teutonic people, which Grimm has so laboriously collected\r\nfor us? They have lived through centuries of time, because they have\r\ntold of genii and giant, governed by the will of puny man and made to\r\ndo his bidding. Eagerly the race has read them, pleased to see\r\nsymbolically pictured forth man's power over elements stronger than\r\nhimself. In fact, the study of the race development is much like the\r\nstudy of those huge, almost obliterated outlines upon the walls of\r\nEgyptian temples--dim, vague, fragmentary, yet giving us glimpses of\r\ninsight and flashes of light, which aid much in the understanding of\r\nthe meaning of to-day. We find the instincts of the race renewed in\r\neach new-born infant. Each individual child desires to master his\r\nsurroundings. He cannot yet drive a real horse and wagon, but his very\r\nsoul delights in the three-inch horse and the gayly painted wagon\r\nattached; he cannot tame real tigers and lions, but his eyes dance\r\nwith pleasure as he places and replaces the animals of his toy\r\nmenagerie; he cannot at present run engines or direct railways, but he\r\ncan control for a whole half-hour the movement of his miniature train;\r\nhe is not yet ready for real fatherhood, but he can pet and play with,\r\nand rock to sleep, and tenderly guard the doll baby.\r\n\r\nDr. Seguin also calls attention to the fact that a handsomely dressed\r\nlady will be passed by unnoticed by a child, whereas her counterpart\r\nin a foot-long doll will call forth his most rapt attention; the one\r\nis too much for the small brain, the other is just enough.\r\n\r\nThe boy who has a toy gun marches and drills and camps and fights many\r\na battle before the real battle comes. The little girl who has a toy\r\nstove plays at building a fire and putting on a kettle long before\r\nthese real responsibilities come to her.\r\n\r\nA young mother, whose daughter had been for some time in a\r\nKindergarten, came to me and said, \"I have been surprised to see how\r\nmy little Katherine handles the baby, and how sweetly and gently she\r\ntalks to him.\" I said to the daughter, \"Katherine, where did you learn\r\nhow to talk to baby, and to take care of one so nicely?\" \"Why, that's\r\nthe way we talk to the dolly at Kindergarten!\" she replied. Her powers\r\nof baby-loving had been developed definitely by the toy baby, so that\r\nwhen the real baby came, she was ready to transfer her tenderness to\r\nthe larger sphere. Thus, as I said before, toys form a bridge between\r\nthe great realities and possibilities of life, and the small\r\ncapacities of the child. If wisely selected, they lead him on from\r\nconquering yet to conquer. Thus he enters ever widening and increasing\r\nfields of activity, until he stands as God intended he should stand,\r\nthe master of all the elements and forces about him, until he can bid\r\nthe solid earth, \"Bring forth thy treasures\"; until he can say unto\r\nthe great ocean, \"Thus far shalt thou go and no farther\"; until he can\r\ncall unto the quick lightning, \"Speak thou my words across a\r\ncontinent\"; until he can command the fierce fire, \"Do thou my\r\nbidding\"; and earth, and air, and fire, and water, become the servants\r\nof the divine intelligence which is within him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nHOW TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR MOTHERS AND KINDERGARTNERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll festival occasions, when rightly used, have a unifying effect upon\r\nthe family, neighborhood, Sunday-school, church, state, or nation, in\r\nthat they direct all minds, for the time being, away from self, and in\r\none direction, toward one central thought. The family festivals are an\r\nenormous power in the hands of the mother who knows how to use them\r\naright. By means of the birthday anniversaries, Fourth of July,\r\nThanksgiving, and above all, Christmas, she can direct her children's\r\nactivities into channels of unselfish endeavor.\r\n\r\nOf all festivals of the year the Christmas festival is perhaps the\r\nleast understood, that is, if one is to judge by the manner in which\r\nthe day is generally observed. _Why do we celebrate Christmas? What\r\nare we celebrating?_ Is it not the greatest manifestation of love,\r\nunselfish love, that has ever been revealed to man? And how, as a\r\nrule, are children taught to observe it? Usually by expecting an undue\r\namount of attention, an unlimited amount of injudicious feeding, and a\r\nselfish exaction of unneeded presents; thus egotism, greed, and\r\nselfishness are fostered, where love, generosity, and self-denial\r\nshould be exercised.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas season is the season in which _the joy of giving_ should\r\nbe so much greater than that of receiving, that the child, through his\r\nown experiences, is prepared somewhat to comprehend that great truth,\r\n\"God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son.\"\r\n\r\nFor weeks beforehand the mother can lay her plans by means of which\r\neach child in the family may be led to make something, or may do\r\nwithout something, or may earn money for the purchase of something,\r\nwhich is to add to his Christmas joy by enabling him to give to those\r\nhe loves, and also to some less fortunate child who, but for his\r\nthoughtfulness, would be without any Christmas \"cheer.\" In this\r\nendeavor, of course, the mother must join with heart and soul, else\r\nthe giving is liable to become a mere formal fulfillment of a taxing\r\nobligation.\r\n\r\nLittle children, when rightly dealt with, enjoy putting _themselves_\r\ninto the preparations with which they are to surprise and please\r\nothers fully as much, if not more, than they enjoy receiving presents.\r\nSo near as yet are they to the hand of God that unselfish love is an\r\neasy thing to inculcate. Let me contrast two preparations for\r\nChristmas which have passed under my own eye. In the first case I\r\nchanced to be in one of those crowded toy-shops where hurried, tired\r\nwomen are trying to fill out their lists of supposed obligations for\r\nthe Christmas season. All was confusion and haste, impatience, and\r\nmore or less ill-humor. My attention was directed towards a handsomely\r\ndressed mother, leading by the hand an over-dressed little girl of\r\nabout eight years of age. The tones of the woman's voice struck like a\r\ndiscord through my soul. \"Come on!\" said she petulantly to the child\r\nwho had stopped for a moment to admire some new toy. \"Come on, we have\r\nto give her something and we may as well buy her a couple of dolls.\r\nThey'll be broken to pieces in three weeks' time, but that's no matter\r\nto us. Come on, I've no time to wait.\" This last was accompanied by an\r\nimpatient jerk of the loitering child's arm. Thus what _should have\r\nbeen the joy of Christmas-giving was made to that child a\r\ndisagreeable, unwilling and useless expenditure of money_. What part\r\nof the real Christmas spirit, the God spirit \"which so loved the\r\nworld,\" could possibly come to a child from such a preparation for\r\nChristmas as this? Nor is it an unusual occurrence. Go into any of our\r\nlarge stores and shops just before Christmas and you will see scores\r\nof women checking off their lists in a way which shows the relief of\r\nhaving \"one more present settled.\" All the great, true, and beautiful\r\nspirit of Christmas joy is gone and a mere commercial transaction,\r\noftentimes a vulgar display of wealth, has taken its place.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, go with me into one of our quiet Kindergartens,\r\nwhere the sunshine without is rivaled by the sunshine within. See the\r\nwhite-aproned teacher seat herself and gather around her the group of\r\neager children. Listen to the tones of her voice when she says, \"Oh,\r\nchildren, children! You don't know what a happy time I am going to let\r\nyou have this Christmas! Just guess, each one of you, what we are\r\ngoing to do to make this the gladdest, brightest, happiest Christmas\r\nthat ever was!\" Look into the eager little faces anticipating a new\r\njoy, knowing from past experience that the joy means effort, endeavor,\r\nself-control, and self-denial; nevertheless, that it means happiness\r\ntoo. Listen to the eager questions and plans of the children. Some of\r\nthem, alas, are showing their past training in selfishness, by their\r\n\"You're going to give each of us a present,\" or \"You're going to have\r\na party!\" Then hear her gleeful answer, \"No, guess again, it is better\r\nthan that!--better even than that!\" Then, after a pause, during which\r\nexpectation stands on tiptoe, \"I am going to let each one of you be a\r\nlittle Santa Claus. We are going to make not only mamma and papa\r\nhappy, but also some dear little child who might not have a happy\r\nChristmas unless we gave one to him!\" Listen, as I have listened, to\r\nthe clapping of hands after such an announcement. Look at the light\r\nwhich comes into the eyes. Notice the eager look of interest upon each\r\nchildish face as all seat themselves at the work-table and the plan of\r\nwork is more definitely laid out. Go, as I have gone, morning after\r\nmorning, and see these same children working patiently, earnestly, and\r\ncontinuously upon the little gifts which are to make Christmas happier\r\nfor some one else. Will you then need to ask the question as to which\r\nis the truer way of celebrating the holy Christmas time? Not that I\r\nwould have any mother deprived of the pleasure of giving to her\r\nchildren, any more than I would have her children robbed of their\r\npleasure of giving to others. Let us be careful that our gifts are not\r\ngifts of useless profusion, of such articles as cultivate\r\nself-indulgence, vanity, or indolence. Gifts for children should be\r\nfew and simple, such as are suggestive and will aid them in the future\r\ndrawing out of their own inner thoughts or ideals. Above all let the\r\njoy of having given of his best to some one else be the chief thought\r\nof the glad Christmas time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nSANTA CLAUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll little children are poets if not marred by the prosaic parent or\r\nteacher who unintentionally dulls the imaginative faculties by\r\ninsisting upon their minds dwelling exclusively on _facts_ which can\r\nbe verified by the five senses.\r\n\r\nMuch innocent pleasure as well as much development of intellectual\r\npower is lost by this misapprehension of a child's needs. _All great\r\ntruth must come to the immature mind in an embodied form_ or by means\r\nof a symbol. In fact, we of more mature culture still cling to the\r\nsacred symbols of the church by means of which communion with the\r\nDivine and the regenerating power of the spirit of God are expressed.\r\nThe spire of a church, the flag of our nation, the medal with which we\r\ndecorate the breast of a hero, are but a few of the symbols with which\r\nwe are all familiar. Indeed, if symbols were banished from our daily\r\nlives much of pleasure and beauty would be lost.\r\n\r\nAgain, when we insist upon mere facts being presented to our children\r\nwe rob them of the great heirloom which has come down to them from the\r\npast in the form of those inexhaustible mythical stories by means of\r\nwhich the race has learned its most beautiful lessons of the true\r\nnobility and grandeur of life; stories so rich and full and\r\nsignificant that two or three thousand years have not dimmed their\r\nluster, nor lessened their power to hold and impress the childish\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nAs the Christmas season approaches many honest, earnest parents are\r\nperplexed as to what to do with the time-honored legend of Santa\r\nClaus. They do not realize that he is but the poetic embodiment of the\r\nChristian thought of great love manifesting itself through giving. The\r\njoyous loving nature of the innocent Santa Claus brings closer to the\r\nchildish heart the realization of the willingness with which the\r\nDivine Father gave to his children--mankind. The traditional fireplace\r\nthrough which the beloved Santa Claus gains entrance into the house is\r\nbut a symbol of that center of light and warmth and cheer which love\r\nlights in every true home. The mystery of the coming and going of this\r\ngreat-hearted lover of good little children is but the embodied way of\r\nexpressing that mystery of love which makes labor light and sacrifice\r\na pleasure. The whole legend of Santa Claus, when rightly understood,\r\nis but the necessarily crude--and therefore more easily\r\ngrasped--foreshadowing of the sacred thought of God's infinite love\r\nwhich lies at the very center of the Christmas thought. No one can\r\ndeplore more than we Kindergartners do the coarse and oftentimes\r\ngrotesque representations of Santa Claus which are to be seen in many\r\nadvertisements and shop windows at this season of the year.\r\n\r\nAlmost all children gradually outgrow the idea of Santa Claus as they\r\ndo other childish conceptions after they have served their purpose of\r\ntraining the emotional nature in the right direction. The transition\r\nis the more easily made if the child is gradually led to make and to\r\ngive Christmas gifts to those he loves. Thus, as I have tried to show\r\nin a previous article, the mere material thought of Christmas as a\r\ntime for a jolly lot of fun is gradually changed into the higher\r\nthought of a joyful festival, _through the child's own deeds_.\r\n\r\nNo mother need expect her child to understand the Christian Christmas\r\nby one celebration. His own experiences of the joy which arises from\r\nunselfish giving must be repeated many times before he can enter into\r\nthe thought that God, in whose image he has been made, must have shown\r\nhis love to mankind by some such manifestation as that which the\r\ncelebration of Christmas commemorates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS TIME.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nA memory which will always remain with me comes up as I approach the\r\nend of these chronicles. And although it did not arise from any one\r\npicture or song of the \"Mother-Play-Book,\" it was caused by the\r\nKindergarten study which had become part of our inmost life.\r\n\r\n          [2] Reprinted, by request, from \"Two Children of the\r\n          Foothills.\"\r\n\r\nThe long, dry season was over. Half a dozen rains had refreshed the\r\nland and caused it to blossom like a garden. It was hard to realize,\r\nmidst the roses and lilies, tender green foliage and fragrant\r\norange-blossoms, rippling streams and songs of mocking-birds, that\r\nChristmas was approaching; our northern minds had always associated\r\nthe season with sleigh-bells and ice and snow, and yet it was amidst\r\njust such semitropical surroundings as these, that in the faraway\r\nPalestine was born the Babe, the celebration of whose returning\r\nbirthday each year fills all Christendom with the spirit of\r\nself-sacrifice, love, and joy, and binds, as does no other festal day,\r\na multitude of the human race into one common brotherhood.\r\n\r\nMargaret and I decided that whatever else we did or did not do, during\r\nthe remainder of our sojourn among the hills, the children should have\r\na _real Christmas_. In order that we might make it an inner Christmas\r\nas well as an outer one, we began at the approach of Advent to show\r\nthem how to make Christmas presents. It took no small amount of\r\npatience to pin down to definite work, which must be neatly and\r\ndaintily done, the two little mortals who had lived almost as free\r\nfrom tasks as the lilies of the field. However, we both realized that\r\nthe children must make a real effort to give genuinely to others\r\nsomething which they themselves had made, if they were to have the\r\nreal joy which ought to come with the receiving of presents.\r\n\r\nFar too often children accept Christmas presents as so many added,\r\nmaterial possessions, not as expressions of love and service from\r\nothers. We had both long ago learned that only he who gives can truly,\r\nspiritually receive, and that a gift without this comprehension of its\r\ninner meaning is no gift at all, but merely something gained which\r\noftentimes awakens greed and selfishness.\r\n\r\nTherefore, by dint of raising up visions of _how surprised_\r\ngrossmutter would be when Christmas morning came and she received two\r\npresents made by four little hands she loved, by enacting in dramatic\r\ndetail the astonishment which their father would show when he too\r\nshould receive a present made by them, we succeeded in awakening in\r\nthem sufficient ambition to attempt what was to both of them a\r\ndisagreeable task. They had been willing enough to draw, cut, fold,\r\nmold, or paste anything which would serve as an illustration of a\r\nstory in which they were interested, or which would revivify some\r\npleasant personal experience; but to sit down and deliberately draw,\r\nor paint, or sew an object for somebody else, with the thought of\r\nmaking it pleasant to that person rather than to themselves, was a new\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nFirst one and then the other of us would occasionally sew a flower\r\nupon a picture-frame when the little untrained fingers grew too tired;\r\nor we would adroitly exchange work, letting them bring in a pail of\r\nwater from the spring while we put a strip or two in a gay\r\ngold-and-scarlet mat which was to be worked over into a Christmas\r\npresent, thus bringing the end of the little task somewhat nearer.\r\nOccasionally, of course, a story would be told of some loving little\r\nchild about whom even the fairies sang, because he or she worked hard\r\nto make Christmas gifts for loved ones. Sometimes Margaret would\r\nexclaim: \"What do you suppose _the knights_ would say if they should\r\ncome riding up the road and see two dear children working away as hard\r\nas they could on their Christmas presents?\"\r\n\r\nThe first two presents, for grossmutter and father, their two nearest\r\nrelatives, were finished and daintily folded away in colored tissue\r\npaper, when Margaret had a whispered conversation with them and\r\nsuggested that they should surprise me also with a Christmas present,\r\nand I, on a like occasion, proposed to them that they should surprise\r\nher with something at Christmas time. Then followed days of whispered\r\ntalk; of sudden hiding of work, or of gleeful shouting: \"Go away! You\r\nmustn't come here now!\"\r\n\r\nOften there would be delighted covering up of the hands and lap at my\r\napproach, or at that of Margaret--scenes so common in the homes of\r\nKindergarten-trained children, but so delightfully new to these little\r\nArabs of the desert who had never, in all their short lives before,\r\nfelt the dignity of individual, personal possessions which they could\r\ngive away.\r\n\r\nOur presents finished and mysteriously laid away, the next step was to\r\nlead to the thought of making presents for our next neighbor and his\r\ngood wife, whose ranch was about half a mile away. This, of course,\r\nsoon led on to the idea of having a Christmas present ready for\r\n_everybody_. There were only about five families in all on the\r\nfoothills, but they constituted _everybody_ to the children, whose\r\nworld, dear souls, was bounded by the horizon which had its center in\r\ntheir own home; saving of course, that boundless world into which\r\nMargaret and I had introduced them through pictures and stories, where\r\nlived the mighty kings and queens, giants and genii, fairies and\r\nprincesses, prophets and priests, and above all, _the knights_. This\r\nlatter world of the imagination was such a grand world that it did not\r\nneed presents.\r\n\r\nSoon the two happy little hearts were overflowing with the true\r\nChristmas love; and the presents made by their own hands \"for\r\n_everybody_\" were laid out upon my bed and examined and exclaimed\r\nover. Each of these was again folded up in a bright piece of tissue\r\npaper and tied with a bit of narrow, daintily colored ribbon and\r\nlabeled with the name of the person to whom it was to be given. All\r\nthese long, busy days were so full of Christmas talks and songs and\r\nstories that they even yet bring back to me the feeling of having\r\nlived them in the midst of a great musical festival.\r\n\r\nWe had frequent occasion to cross the ranches belonging to our\r\ndifferent neighbors, in our daily tramps over the foothills, and often\r\nmet the men at their work or stopped to chat for a moment with the\r\nwomen in their doorways. At such times, Georgie would look up with a\r\nlaughing face and sparkling eyes and say: \"We've got somefin' for you\r\nfor Christmas, but you mustn't know what it is.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, if the inquisitive neighbor would question, he would dance\r\nabout and clap his hands, and shake his little head, saying: \"No, no,\r\nno! Wait until Christmas comes, and then you shall see it; but we made\r\nit all ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Cept what _they_ did to help us,\" the more conscientious Lena would\r\nadd, as she pointed to Margaret or me.\r\n\r\nWe had found, as is not uncommon in sparsely settled districts, where\r\nthere must necessarily be a struggle for a livelihood, that life among\r\nour neighbors had somewhat narrowed itself down to the material\r\nstandpoint, and consequently, as always happens when this is the case,\r\nvarious frictions had occurred among them, leaving them not always in\r\nquite the neighborly attitude toward each other. But no one was able\r\nto resist the children's joyful over-flowing Christmas love.\r\n\r\nIn a short time it was settled among us all that the Christmas\r\ncelebration should take place at Georgie's and Lena's home, and that\r\nall the neighbors should be present on Christmas Eve to see the\r\nlighting of the Christmas tree, which Margaret and I had decided was\r\nto be as gorgeous as our limited resources could make it.\r\n\r\nIn a little while first one and then another neighbor volunteered to\r\nhelp decorate the house; one offering to saw off and bring to us\r\nbranches from an unusually beautiful pepper-tree; another volunteered\r\nhis services in going to town for anything we might need; and a good\r\nhousewife recalled the days when she was young and asked if we would\r\nlike to have her make some ginger-bread boys and girls and animals to\r\nhang on the tree, and so on. Before long the children's spirit of\r\nenthusiasm and love for others had spread throughout our small\r\nfoothill world, and everywhere we went we were greeted with smiles,\r\nsignificant nods, and occasional whispered conversations.\r\n\r\nA few days before Christmas came, one of our foothill neighbors\r\nstopped us on the road to suggest that he should go down, on Christmas\r\nEve, to the mesa below and bring up two little English children whose\r\nhome had been saddened by the death of their father a few weeks\r\nbefore, and whose mother, being a stranger in California, had no\r\nfriends to whom to go. Thus was the Christmas spirit overflowing the\r\nfoothills and spreading on to the farther districts. Then some one\r\nelse thought of a man and his wife and young baby who lived about six\r\nmiles up the ca\u00f1on, and they, too, were invited. All small grudges\r\nwere forgotten and seemingly swallowed up in the coming festivities.\r\n\r\nThe contagion of love is as great as the contagion of disease or\r\ncrime. Each time we finished a bit of trimming for the tree, which was\r\nyet to be selected, it had now to be taken down to be shown to Mrs.\r\nMiddlin. As we passed the old wood-chopper he would make some light,\r\nlaughing remark, and we occasionally stopped at his side to sing to\r\nhim a new Christmas song which the children had just learned. He would\r\nat such times lay down his axe, and his wrinkled old face would become\r\nbright with the light of his far-away youth, as he looked down into\r\nthe children's happy, eager eyes; and he usually sent us on our way\r\nwith some such remark as, \"Well, them children air great ones,\" or\r\nelse it would be, \"Children will be children. I used to be that way\r\nmyself.\" The half-invalid woman, whom pain had made fretful and\r\nnervous, and who had been in the habit of declaring that all children\r\nwere a nuisance and ought to be kept in their homes, could not resist\r\nGeorgie's roguish shout, \"I got somefin' for you Christmas! You must\r\nbe sure to come up to see the Christmas tree.\" On the eventful day she\r\nactually did come with all the rest and brought with her some\r\nhome-made candy, such as she used to make when she was a girl some\r\nforty odd years before.\r\n\r\nThis drawing together round the Christmas thought, each and every one\r\nmaking an effort to add something to the joy of the occasion, proved\r\nwhat every true lover of humanity believes, that deep down in each\r\nhuman heart is love and a desire to be loved, is joy in seeing others\r\nhappy, and the greater joy of serving others.\r\n\r\nIn return for this unexpected volunteer addition to our plans for the\r\nchildren, Margaret and I contrived some trifle or joke for each man\r\nmember of the community. To one it was a bundle of toothpicks done up\r\nin fancy tissue paper. To another it was a Mexican tamale. To a young\r\nfellow who worked on one of the ranches it was a candy sweetheart. For\r\neach of the women we made some trifle in the way of needle-book,\r\niron-holder, or the like, as we wanted the children to have the\r\npleasure of seeing their elders go up to the tree and receive gifts as\r\nwell as themselves.\r\n\r\nThree days before the Christmas Eve party the two children and their\r\nfather, Margaret and I, went up the ca\u00f1on to let the children select a\r\nsmall fir-tree for the Christmas tree. As we came triumphantly driving\r\nthrough a neighbor's ranch on our way home with the little tree in the\r\nback of the wagon, the children shouted out with great glee: \"Come\r\nout! Come out! and see the tree! See the tree! Here it is! Here it is!\r\nThe really, really Christmas tree!\" And out came both gray-haired old\r\nneighbors, almost as much pleased as the children.\r\n\r\nThe tree was fastened between two boards, and then with great ceremony\r\nwe marched in a procession into the little best room which their\r\ngrandmother usually kept shut and unused, and placed it upon the table\r\nin the center of the room. Then began the exciting, and to the\r\nchildren most charming, work of decorating it with strings of popcorn\r\nand cranberries; and fancy chains made with the scarlet and blue, gilt\r\nand silver paper which loving hearts in the far-away Chicago had sent,\r\nhelped make gorgeous our little tree. Some fancy pink and pale blue\r\npapers which had come from the drug store had been carefully saved for\r\nthe occasion. Onto these we pasted narrow strips of the gold and\r\nsilver paper, and \"Chinese lanterns\" were made, much to the delight of\r\nthe children. Each afternoon we decorated the tree with the work which\r\nhad been done in the morning, and then danced around it and sang songs\r\nto it, and told it stories about other little Christmas trees which\r\nhad made other little children happy.\r\n\r\nOne day Georgie improvised a song, and like the poet of old, danced in\r\nrhythm to the melody which he himself created to the tune of\r\n\"Heigh-ho, the way we go.\" The words were as follows:\r\n\r\n                \"Miss Margaret and I\r\n                We wish we could fly,\r\n    Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, under the Christmas tree.\r\n                We sing now for joy,\r\n                The girl and the boy,\r\n    Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, under the Christmas tree.\"\r\n\r\nHe had undoubtedly caught the rhythm, and perhaps the refrain, from\r\nsome verses which Margaret had written about our mountain home, and\r\nwhose refrain was \"Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, under the greenwood-tree.\" But\r\nI was much pleased to see his original application of the idea, and\r\nhis feeling of the fitness of the festival occasion for improvised\r\nverse. It seemed to bubble out of the fullness of his joy just as many\r\na refrain and love song of old was born on festival occasions; so\r\nclose is the child akin to the child race.\r\n\r\nSome time before this Margaret had brought from her mysterious trunk a\r\nsmall and very beautiful copy of the Mother and Child which forms the\r\ncenter of Correggio's great picture, \"The Holy Night,\" and Lena had\r\nsewed a round picture frame, designed by Margaret, with a gold star on\r\nthe upper corner and a modest little violet on the lower, symbolic, it\r\nseemed to me, of the exaltation and humility which that picture so\r\nmarvelously portrays. It was to be a joint gift from Margaret and Lena\r\nto the dear old grossmutter. The children had both sat and studied the\r\ntwo beautiful faces, so luminous with light; and Margaret had\r\nexplained to them that the light came from the dear baby's face and\r\nshone into that of the mother because this dear little Christ Child\r\nhad just come from God and the mother knew it.\r\n\r\n\"That is what makes her so happy,\" said Georgie, and Margaret\r\nanswered, \"Yes, that is what makes every good mother happy when she\r\nlooks into her baby's face,\" and Georgie had accepted this somewhat\r\nbroad interpretation of the picture with one of his significant nods.\r\nSo far as we could ascertain, the children had as yet no training\r\nwhatever in biblical lore, and our plan had been that we would speak\r\nonly in general terms of the Bible story of Christmas until after they\r\nhad experienced the love and joy of service and giving. Then we would\r\ntell them why not only their little world, but the whole great big\r\nworld of Christendom celebrated the day with such joy. But suddenly\r\none evening, as we were returning from our hilltop scramble, Lena\r\nsaid, \"Grossmutter knows all about the dear little Christ Child, and\r\nshe says the angels knew that He was coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's sit down here by this rock,\" said Georgie, \"and then you can\r\ntell us all about it.\" He had implicit faith that Margaret could tell\r\nhim all about anything he wished to know, so he never hesitated to make\r\nthe demand.\r\n\r\nWe sat down on the ground, with sky above us radiant and glowing in\r\nsunset's splendor, and Margaret told, as I had never heard it told\r\nbefore, of the watching of the shepherds and of the coming of the\r\nangels, and when she came to the part, \"and as the shepherds raised\r\ntheir bodies up from the ground and listened and listened, the far-away\r\nmusic came nearer and nearer, and then they saw that the music was the\r\nsinging of countless numbers of beautiful angels, and that the bright\r\nlight which had slowly spread over the whole heavens came from the\r\nbeauty of their faces; the whole sky seemed full of them, and they were\r\nall singing joyfully the first Christmas song that was ever heard on\r\nearth,\" Georgie rose from his half-reclining position and coming close\r\nto Margaret placed his hands upon her shoulder and said, eagerly: \"Sing\r\nit! Sing it! Sing it just as the angels sang it!\"\r\n\r\nShe afterwards told me that she would have given five years of her life\r\nto have had Patti's voice for just that one hour. She quietly replied:\r\n\"I cannot sing it, Georgie, as the angels sang it. No one on earth can\r\nsing it as the angels sang it on the first glad Christmas night, but we\r\ncan know what they meant to tell the shepherds.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned his face away from her with a look of disappointment, and his\r\neyes wandered far over the hills to the glowing sky, then quickly\r\nturning toward us, he said, \"Maybe the Christmas angels will come now.\r\nLet us listen and see if we can hear them.\"\r\n\r\nThen we listened silently until the light began to fade out of the\r\nevening sky, and Margaret said: \"I can tell you what the words were\r\nwhich the angels sang, and perhaps we can feel their song down in our\r\nhearts.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then slowly and reverently she repeated the old, yet ever new,\r\nmessage to mankind: \"Glory to God in the highest. Peace on earth, good\r\nwill to men!\" And gently added, by way of explanation, that good will\r\nto men meant that we were all brothers and sisters in God's sight, and\r\nthat this was one of the great things which the dear Christ Child came\r\nto teach us. \"And this,\" she added, \"is why we celebrate His birthday\r\nby making gifts for 'everybody.'\" Both children nodded assent in a\r\nmatter-of-course way. They, dear little hearts, did not yet know the\r\nschisms and discords that sometimes separate brothers and sisters, and\r\nto them it was a matter of course, that men should accept the angelic\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\nAs we walked home, Georgie skipping and dancing along in front, sang,\r\n\"I love everybody! I love everybody! I am so happy! I am so happy! I\r\nlove everybody!\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I, Georgie,\" said Margaret, earnestly; and I think for the time\r\nbeing, at least, all of us felt the true Christmas spirit. That motto\r\nfrom Froebel's \"Mother-Play-Songs\" came into my mind with a new meaning:\r\n\r\n    \"Would'st thou unite the child for aye with thee,\r\n    Then let him with the Highest One thy union see\r\n    By every noble thought thy heart is fired,\r\n    The young child's soul will surely be inspired.\r\n    And thou can'st no better gift bestow,\r\n    Than union with the Eternal One to know.\"\r\n\r\nWe quickened our steps as we neared home, and all four of us sang\r\nsoftly--\r\n\r\n    \"In another land and clime,\r\n    Long ago and far away.\"\r\n\r\nThe morning of Christmas Eve brought to us our friend, Mrs. Brown, who\r\nhad a Kindergarten in a neighboring town. Her contribution to the\r\nfestive occasion was a box of fifty small wax candles, and we proceeded\r\nat once to add the final touches for the evening entertainment. A\r\nfrieze had already been made around the walls of the room with branches\r\nof the pepper-tree, whose feathery green leaves and coral-colored\r\nbranches of berries made a beautiful decoration. Large bunches of the\r\ndark green eucalyptus had been sawed off and so arranged that they made\r\nframes of the green around the two windows whose white curtains the\r\ngood grossmutter had washed and ironed the day before. In the center of\r\nthe room was the Christmas tree on which hung the treasures worked by\r\nlittle hands. The red, green, and yellow candles were fastened in the\r\nsafer parts of the horizontal branches; others were placed around the\r\ntable on candlesticks made of ripe oranges; and a row of these golden\r\ncandlesticks was also placed upon the edge of a wooden shelf which had\r\nheld the grossmutter's German Bible. The ugly woolen cover of the shelf\r\nwas entirely concealed by soft green ferns. A pound or two of candy had\r\nbeen purchased by the father, and this the dear old grandmother, with\r\ntrembling but eager hands, showed us how to tie up with strings of\r\nworsted and fasten to the tree, \"just as they used to do in the\r\nfaterland,\" she explained to the children. Her joy over the whole\r\naffair was, if anything, greater than that of the little ones. She\r\ninsisted that Mrs. Brown, Margaret, and I should be her guests at the\r\nnoonday dinner; and her appreciation of our work was shown by the\r\nkilling of the fatted goose, and by boiling and baking and stewing, in\r\ntrue German fashion, about three times the quantity of food which we\r\ncould possibly consume. During the getting ready of this dinner she\r\nbustled in and out of the little parlor, sometimes throwing her arms\r\naround the children and exclaiming, \"Oh, Chorgie! Chorgie! Dis is just\r\nlike a Christmas in the old country! Just tink of it! Just tink of it!\r\nMine kinder are to have a German Christmas! A real German Christmas!\"\r\nThen, as if fearing that her emotions should be taken for weakness, she\r\nbuffeted them severely with her hand and pushed them to one side with\r\nthe words, \"Keep out of de way! Don't talk so much! You are little\r\nnuisances anyhow!\" but with so much love in the tone that the rebuking\r\nwords were unheeded. Again, she would come into the room and stand with\r\nher hands resting upon her hips and gaze silently, with unspeakable\r\nsatisfaction, at the busy scene before her.\r\n\r\nIn making our plans for the evening, Margaret turned and said in a tone\r\nof quiet respect: \"Frau Zorn, we will, of course, expect you to stand\r\nwith the children and us, and receive the guests. It is your party, you\r\nknow, as well as the children's. We are merely helping to get it\r\nready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, mein dear! Mein dear!\" exclaimed the old lady, evidently much\r\npleased with the unexpected prominence which was to be given to her.\r\nWithout further words she bustled out of the room, and in about a\r\nhalf-hour called to Margaret and me to come up into the little attic\r\nabove. There we found her on her knees before an old horsehair trunk\r\nout of which she had taken a black and gray striped silk gown of the\r\nfashion of about twenty years before; also a soft white silk neck\r\nhandkerchief. In an embarrassed tone, looking half-ashamed, half-proud,\r\nshe said: \"I had laid dem away for my burying clothes, but I can wear\r\ndem to-night, if you tink it best.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" exclaimed Margaret; \"that dress is just the thing, and the\r\npretty white handkerchief will make you look young again. I am so glad\r\nyou have them. I will come in time to arrange your hair and I have a\r\nwee bit of a lace handkerchief which I know how to fix into a cap, just\r\nsuch as my own grandmother used to wear, and you will be the handsomest\r\npart of the whole Christmas entertainment.\" Then she added in great\r\nglee: \"Don't let the children see the dress until after you put it on.\r\nIt will be such a lovely surprise for them.\"\r\n\r\nThe old woman's face showed how keen this simple pleasure was to her as\r\nshe softly patted the dress, straightening here and there a bit of its\r\nold-fashioned trimming, and then laid it gently into the trunk until\r\nthe appointed hour should come.\r\n\r\nThe morning work was at last ended, including our most conscientious\r\nendeavors to do justice to the elaborate dinner. We locked the door of\r\nthe little parlor fearing that the temptation to meddle with the wax\r\ncandles might be too great to be resisted. Handing the key to Frau Zorn\r\nand giving our \"Christmas kiss\" to each of the children, somewhat tired\r\nwe went back to our little cabin to rest until the evening. We had\r\npromised to come early so as to be there before the first guests should\r\narrive, and just before starting out on our return Margaret quietly\r\ngathered a basketful of beautiful La France roses which were blossoming\r\nin bewildering profusion near our doorstep.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with those?\" I asked. \"Make every man and\r\nwoman who comes to-night feel that he or she is in true festival\r\nattire,\" she answered, smiling. And sure enough as each guest came in,\r\nLena, by Margaret's instructions, asked the privilege of pinning a\r\nChristmas rose upon the man's coat and the woman's dress. The smile\r\nwith which the unaccustomed decoration was accepted showed the wisdom\r\nof Margaret's plan. An added festivity came over the scene, and each\r\nindividual felt himself or herself duly decorated for the occasion.\r\n\r\nWhen the man from the ca\u00f1on beyond arrived with his wife and the little\r\nthree-months-old baby, Georgie's face was a study worthy of Raphael's\r\nbrush; confusion, surprise, pleasure, joy were all commingled, as\r\nlooking up to Margaret, he exclaimed, \"Why, Miss Marg't! We are going\r\nto have a _real, truly baby_ at our Christmas time!\" Then, lowering his\r\nvoice, \"Perhaps it will be like the Christ baby and we can see the\r\nlight shining from it just as the shepherds saw it.\"\r\n\r\nThe guests had been invited into the little dining-room which was the\r\nusual sitting-room of the family, and the parlor was kept closed. At a\r\nsignal from Margaret, the father of the two children walked forward,\r\nand throwing the door open, invited the guests to walk in. It was\r\nlighted entirely by the wax candles, which gave that peculiar mellow\r\nlight suggestive of silent and reverent feeling that the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch has been wise enough to seize upon and make use of.\r\n\r\nThe hilarious laughter and somewhat awkward jokes which had been going\r\non ceased for the time being. When all were seated on the benches and\r\nthe improvised seats which had been brought in, Margaret and the\r\nchildren sang two or three Christmas songs. Then, as a surprise to the\r\nrest of us, they clustered around the dear old grossmutter and the\r\nfour, bowing, joined in a German hymn of praise and thanksgiving. This\r\nwas intended as a surprise to the father and to me, and was indeed a\r\nsurprise to all of us, as none of the neighbors had ever heard the dear\r\nold woman sing.\r\n\r\nThen came the distribution of presents, and the laughter and jokes and\r\nfun such as happy hearts improvise and enjoy. One neighbor had brought\r\nan old-fashioned hat-box labeled \"For Lena and Georgie.\" When opened,\r\nout sprang two frisky little kittens that, in a frightened fashion,\r\nscampered away under the protecting skirts of some of the women, but\r\nwere soon captured and caressed with delight by the little owners. The\r\nsame thoughtful neighbor had brought two little chickens for the little\r\nEnglish children from the mesa below. They were less lively, but were\r\ntenderly cared for by the children.\r\n\r\nFinally, when all the presents had been distributed, including part of\r\nthe fruit and candy, two of the men laughingly disappeared from the\r\nroom, and on their return, brought between them a huge California\r\npumpkin, which measured five and one-half feet around its\r\ncircumference. This had previously been prepared into what they called\r\na \"Christmas box,\" the top had been cut smoothly off, and into it had\r\nbeen fastened the handle of a bucket. The lower part had been hollowed\r\nout, washed, and dried; the pumpkin seemed almost large enough to have\r\nserved as a carriage for Cinderella. It was placed at Margaret's feet,\r\nand the top lifted off amidst shouts of laughter and the clapping of\r\nhands. Each guest present had stored away in it some loving little\r\ngift, of no value whatever so far as the world considers value, but\r\nrich indeed to one who prizes a gift according to the loving thought\r\nwhich it shows. One woman had pasted upon several sheets of writing\r\npaper some rare ferns and mosses which she had brought from the\r\nmountains of New Mexico years before, and had sewed them together in\r\nthe form of a book. Another had embroidered Margaret's initials upon a\r\nChinese silk scarf, which had been one of her treasures in the days of\r\ngreater prosperity. Another had rounded off and polished a pin-cushion\r\nof Yoca wood, sawed from a stalk in the higher mountain districts. The\r\nfourth had made her a shell-box, of shells gathered on some past trip\r\nto the Cataline Islands. A fifth had heard her express a desire to make\r\na collection of the different kinds of wood which grew in the\r\nneighborhood and had brought carefully sawed and neatly polished\r\nspecimens of a half-dozen varieties, and so on; each showing that her\r\ntaste had been remembered, some wish expressed at an odd moment had\r\nbeen recalled, or some pleasant surprise anticipated.\r\n\r\nMargaret's eyes filled with tears as one by one she unfolded these\r\ngifts of love; then, realizing that such a time as the present needed\r\nmore joy than anything else, she laughingly brushed away the unshed\r\ntears and proposed that they should all enter into some games together.\r\nThis was heartily agreed to by the others, and the evening ended in\r\nalmost a romp. Hands were shaken, good bys were said, the last joke\r\nuttered, and wagon and gig and buggy drove away.\r\n\r\nMargaret, Mrs. Brown, and I remained to help put the children to bed\r\nand somewhat straighten up the little house. Then bidding the\r\nhappy-faced old woman \"Good by,\" we started out, alone, for a quiet\r\nwalk across the hill, under the Christmas stars. As we prepared for bed\r\nMargaret exclaimed, \"What a happy, happy day we have had!\" I looked\r\ninto her radiant face, and said, softly, to myself: \"_Blessed be\r\nmotherhood, even if it must be the mothering of other women's\r\nchildren_!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nA CHRISTMAS CAROL.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAVE ONE.\r\n\r\nMARLEY'S GHOST.\r\n\r\n    [We hardly know of anything better to recommend than the following\r\n    exquisite masterpiece of Dickens, for hearts that have grown dull\r\n    to the real joy of Christmas tide.]\r\n\r\nMarley was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that.\r\nThe register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the\r\nundertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's\r\nname was good upon 'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to.\r\n\r\nOld Marley was as dead as a door-nail.\r\n\r\nMind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there\r\nis particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined,\r\nmyself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in\r\nthe trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my\r\nunhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country's done for. You\r\nwill therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\r\ndead as a door-nail.\r\n\r\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\r\nScrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge\r\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his\r\nsole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even\r\nScrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was\r\nan excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and\r\nsolemnized it with an undoubted bargain.\r\n\r\nThe mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started\r\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\r\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\r\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died\r\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\r\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\r\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\r\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say Saint Paul's churchyard, for\r\ninstance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.\r\n\r\nScrooge never painted out old Marley's name. There it stood, years\r\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\r\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business\r\ncalled Scrooge, Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both\r\nnames. It was all the same to him.\r\n\r\nOh, but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\r\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old\r\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck\r\nout generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an\r\noyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed\r\nnose, shriveled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his\r\nthin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty\r\nrime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He\r\ncarried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his\r\noffice in the dog-days, and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.\r\n\r\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\r\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\r\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\r\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The\r\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the\r\nadvantage over him in only one respect--they often \"came down\"\r\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\r\n\r\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \"My\r\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\" No beggars\r\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\r\no'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\r\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared\r\nto know him; and when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners\r\ninto doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though\r\nthey said, \"No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\"\r\n\r\nBut what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\r\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\r\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \"nuts\" to Scrooge.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\r\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\r\nbiting weather, foggy withal, and he could hear the people in the court\r\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their\r\nbreasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them.\r\nThe city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark\r\nalready--it had not been light all day--and candles were flaring in the\r\nwindows of the neighboring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable\r\nbrown air. The fog came pouring in at every chink and key-hole, and was\r\nso dense without, that although the court was of the narrowest, the\r\nhouses opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come\r\ndrooping down, obscuring everything, one might have thought that nature\r\nlived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.\r\n\r\nThe door of Scrooge's counting-house was open that he might keep his\r\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\r\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's\r\nfire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he\r\ncouldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room;\r\nand so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master\r\npredicted that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the\r\nclerk put on his white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the\r\ncandle; in which effort, not being a man of a strong imagination, he\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\n\"A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\" cried a cheerful voice. It\r\nwas the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that\r\nthis was the first intimation he had of his approach.\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" said Scrooge, \"Humbug!\"\r\n\r\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\r\nnephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\r\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\r\n\r\n\"Christmas a humbug, uncle!\" said Scrooge's nephew. \"You don't mean\r\nthat, I am sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"Merry Christmas! What right have you to be\r\nmerry? What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, then,\" returned the nephew, gayly. \"What right have you to be\r\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.\"\r\n\r\nScrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said\r\n\"Bah!\" again; and followed it up with \"Humbug!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be cross, uncle!\" said the nephew.\r\n\r\n\"What else can I be,\" returned the uncle, \"when I live in such a world\r\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's\r\nChristmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\r\nfor finding yourself a year older, but not an hour richer; a time for\r\nbalancing your books and having every item in 'em through a round dozen\r\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\" said\r\nScrooge, indignantly, \"every idiot who goes about with 'Merry\r\nChristmas' on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and\r\nburied with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle!\" pleaded the nephew.\r\n\r\n\"Nephew!\" returned the uncle, sternly, \"keep Christmas in your own way,\r\nand let me keep it in mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep it,\" repeated Scrooge's nephew, \"but you don't keep it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me leave it alone, then,\" said Scrooge. \"Much good may it do you!\r\nMuch good it has ever done you!\"\r\n\r\n\"There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\r\nhave not profited, I dare say,\" returned the nephew, \"Christmas among\r\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when\r\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\r\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\r\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I\r\nknow of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by\r\none consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\r\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\r\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\r\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket,\r\nI believe that it _has_ done me good, and _will_ do me good; and I say,\r\nGod bless it!\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\r\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\r\nlast frail spark forever.\r\n\r\n\"Let me hear another sound from _you_,\" said Scrooge, \"and you'll\r\nkeep your Christmas by losing your situation! You're quite a powerful\r\nspeaker, sir,\" he added, turning to his nephew. \"I wonder you don't go\r\ninto Parliament.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be angry, uncle. Come dine with us to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nScrooge said that he would see him--yes, indeed he did. He went the\r\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\r\nextremity first.\r\n\r\n\"But why?\" cried Scrooge's nephew. \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you get married?\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Because I fell in love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you fell in love!\" growled Scrooge, as if that were the only\r\none thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. \"Good\r\nafternoon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why\r\ngive it as a reason for not coming now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be\r\nfriends?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never\r\nhad any quarrel, to which I have been a party. But I have made the\r\ntrial in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humor to the\r\nlast. So, a merry Christmas, uncle!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"And a happy New Year!\"\r\n\r\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He\r\nstopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the\r\nclerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\r\nthem cordially.\r\n\r\n\"There's another fellow,\" muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: \"my\r\nclerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking\r\nabout a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.\"\r\n\r\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people\r\nin. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with\r\ntheir hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their\r\nhands, and bowed to him.\r\n\r\n\"Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,\" said one of the gentlemen, referring\r\nto his list. \"Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.\r\nMarley?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\" Scrooge replied. \"He died\r\nseven years ago, this very night.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving\r\npartner,\" said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\r\n\r\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous\r\nword \"liberality,\" Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\r\ncredentials back.\r\n\r\n\"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\" said the gentleman,\r\ntaking up a pen, \"it is more than usually desirable that we should make\r\nsome provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the\r\npresent time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\r\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there no prisons?\" asked Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Plenty of prisons,\" said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\r\n\r\n\"And the Union workhouses?\" demanded Scrooge. \"Are they still in\r\noperation?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are. Still,\" returned the gentleman, \"I wish I could say they\r\nwere not.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigor, then?\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Both very busy, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had\r\noccurred to stop them in their useful course,\" said Scrooge. \"I'm very\r\nglad to hear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of\r\nmind or body to the multitude,\" returned the gentleman, \"a few of us\r\nare endeavoring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink,\r\nand means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all\r\nothers, when want is keenly felt, and abundance rejoices. What shall I\r\nput you down for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing!\" Scrooge replied.\r\n\r\n\"You wish to be anonymous?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish to be left alone,\" said Scrooge. \"Since you ask me what I wish,\r\ngentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,\r\nand I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the\r\nestablishments I have mentioned--they cost enough; and those who are\r\nbadly off must go there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Many can't go there, and many would rather die.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they would rather die,\" said Scrooge, \"they had better do it, and\r\ndecrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you might know it,\" observed the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\"It's not my business,\" Scrooge returned. \"It's enough for a man to\r\nunderstand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's.\r\nMine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\"\r\n\r\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\r\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labors with an improved opinion\r\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so that people ran about with\r\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\r\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a\r\nchurch, whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at Scrooge\r\nout of a gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the\r\nhours and quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards\r\nas if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold\r\nbecame intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some\r\nlaborers were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in\r\na brazier, round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered,\r\nwarming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture.\r\nThe water-plug being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly\r\ncongealed, and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops\r\nwhere holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows\r\nmade pale faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades\r\nbecame a splendid joke: a glorious pageant, with which it was next to\r\nimpossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had\r\nanything to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion\r\nHouse, gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as\r\na Lord Mayor's household should; and even the little tailor, whom he\r\nhad fined five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk and\r\nbloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up to-morrow's pudding in his\r\ngarret, while his lean wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.\r\n\r\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\r\nSaint Dunstan had but nipped the evil spirit's nose with a touch of\r\nsuch weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then\r\nindeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant\r\nyoung nose, gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed\r\nby dogs, stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a\r\nChristmas carol; but at the first sound of\r\n\r\n    \"God bless you, merry gentleman!\r\n    May nothing you dismay!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer\r\nfled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\r\nill will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\r\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\r\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\r\n\r\n\"You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"If quite convenient, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not convenient,\" said Scrooge, \"and it's not fair. If I was to\r\nstop half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill used, I'll be\r\nbound?\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" said Scrooge, \"you don't think me ill used when I pay a\r\nday's wages for no work.\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\r\n\r\n\"A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of\r\nDecember!\" said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \"But I\r\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\r\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\r\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\r\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of\r\nboys, twenty times, in honor of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran\r\nhome to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at\r\nblindman's-buff.\r\n\r\nScrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and\r\nhaving read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening\r\nwith his banker's-book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which\r\nhad once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\r\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\r\nbusiness to be that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\r\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\r\nhouses, and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\r\ndreary enough, for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\r\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\r\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\r\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house that it seemed\r\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\r\nthreshold.\r\n\r\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\r\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\r\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\r\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\r\nabout him as any man in the city of London, even including--which is a\r\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\r\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\r\nlast mention of his seven-years' dead partner that afternoon. And then\r\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\r\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\r\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\r\nMarley's face.\r\n\r\nMarley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow as the other objects\r\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster\r\nin a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge\r\nas Marley used to look, with ghostly spectacles turned up on its\r\nghostly forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or\r\nhot air; and though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly\r\nmotionless. That, and its livid color, made it horrible; but its horror\r\nseemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control, rather than a\r\npart of its own expression.\r\n\r\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\r\n\r\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\r\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy,\r\nwould be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished,\r\nturned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\r\n\r\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment's irresolution, before he shut the door;\r\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind at first, as if he half-expected to\r\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the\r\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\r\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \"Pooh, pooh!\" and closed\r\nit with a bang.\r\n\r\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\r\nand every cask in the wine-merchant's cellars below, appeared to have a\r\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\r\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door and walked across the hall,\r\nand up the stairs, slowly too, trimming his candle as he went.\r\n\r\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six up a good old flight\r\nof stairs, or through a bad young act of Parliament; but I mean to say\r\nyou might have got a hearse up that stair-case, and taken it broadwise,\r\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall and the door towards the\r\nbalustrades, and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\r\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\r\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\r\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well,\r\nso you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.\r\n\r\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\r\nScrooge liked it. But before he shut his heavy door, he walked through\r\nhis rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of\r\nthe face to desire to do that.\r\n\r\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\r\nthe table; nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\r\nbasin ready; and the little sauce-pan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in\r\nhis head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet;\r\nnobody in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious\r\nattitude against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old\r\nshoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\r\n\r\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in;\r\ndouble-locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured\r\nagainst surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and\r\nslippers, and his night-cap, and sat down before the fire to take his\r\ngruel.\r\n\r\nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was\r\nobliged to sit close to it, and brood over it before he could extract\r\nthe least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The\r\nfireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and\r\npaved all round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the\r\nScriptures. There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters, Queens of\r\nSheba, Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like\r\nfeather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in\r\nbutter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that\r\nface of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod,\r\nand swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at\r\nfirst, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the\r\ndisjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of\r\nold Marley's head on every one.\r\n\r\n\"Humbug!\" said Scrooge, and walked across the room.\r\n\r\nAfter several turns, he sat down again. As he threw his head back in\r\nthe chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell that\r\nhung in the room, and communicated, for some purpose now forgotten,\r\nwith a chamber in the highest story of the building. It was with great\r\nastonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he\r\nlooked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in the\r\noutset that it scarcely made a sound, but soon it rang out loudly, and\r\nso did every bell in the house.\r\n\r\nThis might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an\r\nhour. The bells ceased as they had begun, together. They were succeeded\r\nby a clanking noise, deep down below, as if some person were dragging a\r\nheavy chain over the casks in the wine merchant's cellar. Scrooge then\r\nremembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described\r\nas dragging chains.\r\n\r\nThe cellar door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the\r\nnoise much louder on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then\r\ncoming straight towards his door.\r\n\r\n\"It's humbug, still!\" said Scrooge. \"I won't believe it.\"\r\n\r\nHis color changed though, when, without a pause, it came on through the\r\nheavy door, and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming\r\nin the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, \"I know him; Marley's\r\nGhost!\" and fell again.\r\n\r\nThe same face; the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat,\r\ntights, and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his\r\npigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he\r\ndrew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him\r\nlike a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of\r\ncash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in\r\nsteel. His body was transparent: so that Scrooge, observing him, and\r\nlooking through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nScrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had\r\nnever believed it until now.\r\n\r\nNo, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom\r\nthrough and through, and saw it standing before him, though he felt the\r\nchilling influence of his death-cold eyes, and marked the very texture\r\nof the folded 'kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he\r\nhad not observed before, he was still incredulous, and fought against\r\nhis senses.\r\n\r\n\"How now!\" said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. \"What do you want\r\nwith me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Much!\"--Marley's voice, no doubt about it.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask me who I _was_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who _were_ you, then?\" said Scrooge, raising his voice. \"You're\r\nparticular, for a shade.\" He was going to say \"_to_ a shade,\" but\r\nsubstituted this, as more appropriate.\r\n\r\n\"In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you--can you sit down?\" asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.\r\n\r\n\"I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do it, then.\"\r\n\r\nScrooge asked the question because he didn't know whether a ghost so\r\ntransparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt\r\nthat in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the\r\nnecessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the Ghost sat down on the\r\nopposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.\r\n\r\n\"You don't believe in me,\" observed the Ghost.\r\n\r\n\"I don't,\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your\r\nsenses?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you doubt your senses?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said Scrooge, \"a little thing affects them. A slight\r\ndisorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit\r\nof beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an\r\nunderdone potato. There's more of gravy than of grave about you,\r\nwhatever you are.\"\r\n\r\nScrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel,\r\nin his heart, by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to\r\nbe smart, as a means of distracting his own attention and keeping down\r\nhis terror; for the Specter's voice disturbed the very marrow in his\r\nbones.\r\n\r\nTo sit staring at those fixed, glazed eyes in silence for a moment\r\nwould play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. There was something\r\nvery awful, too, in the Specter's being provided with an infernal\r\natmosphere of its own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was\r\nclearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its\r\nhair, and skirts, and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapor\r\nfrom an oven.\r\n\r\n\"You see this toothpick?\" said Scrooge, returning quickly to the\r\ncharge, for the reason just assigned, and wishing, though it were only\r\nfor a second, to divert the vision's stony gaze from himself.\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" replied the Ghost.\r\n\r\n\"You are not looking at it,\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"But I see it,\" said the Ghost, \"notwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" returned Scrooge, \"I have but to swallow this, and be for the\r\nrest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own\r\ncreation. Humbug, I tell you! Humbug!\"\r\n\r\nAt this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with\r\nsuch a dismal and appalling noise that Scrooge held on tight to his\r\nchair to save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was\r\nhis horror when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head, as\r\nif it were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon\r\nits breast!\r\n\r\nScrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.\r\n\r\n\"Mercy!\" he said. \"Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Man of the worldly mind,\" replied the Ghost, \"do you believe in me or\r\nnot?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and\r\nwhy do they come to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is required of every man,\" the Ghost returned, \"that the spirit\r\nwithin him should walk abroad among his fellowmen, and travel far and\r\nwide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do\r\nso after death. It is doomed to wander through the world--oh, woe is\r\nme!--and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth,\r\nand turned to happiness!\"\r\n\r\nAgain the Specter raised a cry and shook its chain and wrung its\r\nshadowy hands.\r\n\r\n\"You are fettered,\" said Scrooge, trembling. \"Tell me why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wear the chain I forged in life,\" replied the Ghost. \"I made it link\r\nby link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of\r\nmy own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to _you_?\"\r\n\r\nScrooge trembled more and more.\r\n\r\n\"Or would you know,\" pursued the Ghost, \"the weight and length of the\r\nstrong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this\r\nseven Christmas Eves ago. You have labored on it since. It is a\r\nponderous chain!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding\r\nhimself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable; but he\r\ncould see nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Jacob,\" he said, imploringly, \"old Jacob Marley, tell me more. Speak\r\ncomfort to me, Jacob!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have none to give,\" the Ghost replied. \"It comes from other regions,\r\nEbenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of\r\nmen. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all\r\npermitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger\r\nanywhere. My spirit never walked beyond our counting-house--mark\r\nme!--in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our\r\nmoney-changing hole, and weary journeys lie before me!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his\r\nhands in his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he\r\ndid so now, but without lifting up his eyes or getting off his knees.\r\n\r\n\"You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,\" Scrooge observed, in a\r\nbusiness-like manner, though with humility and deference.\r\n\r\n\"Slow!\" the Ghost repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Seven years dead,\" mused Scrooge, \"and traveling all the time!\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole time,\" said the Ghost. \"No rest, no peace. Incessant torture\r\nof remorse.\"\r\n\r\n\"You travel fast?\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"On the wings of the wind,\" replied the Ghost.\r\n\r\n\"You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,\"\r\nsaid Scrooge.\r\n\r\nThe Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain\r\nso hideously in the dead silence of the night that the Ward would have\r\nbeen justified in indicting it for a nuisance.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, captive, bound and double-ironed!\" cried the phantom, \"not to know\r\nthat ages of incessant labor, by immortal creatures, for this earth\r\nmust pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is\r\nall developed. Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in\r\nits little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too\r\nshort for its vast means of usefulness. Not to know that no space of\r\nregret can make amends for one life's opportunity misused! Yet such was\r\nI! Oh, such was I!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,\" faltered Scrooge,\r\nwho now began to apply this to himself.\r\n\r\n\"Business!\" cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. \"Mankind was my\r\nbusiness. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy,\r\nforbearance, and benevolence were all my business. The dealings of my\r\ntrade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my\r\nbusiness!\"\r\n\r\nIt held up its chain at arm's-length, as if that were the cause of all\r\nits unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.\r\n\r\n\"At this time of the rolling year,\" the Specter said, \"I suffer most.\r\nWhy did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned\r\ndown, and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men\r\nto a poor abode! Were there no poor homes to which its light would have\r\nconducted _me_?\"\r\n\r\nScrooge was very much dismayed to hear the Specter going on at this\r\nrate, and began to quake exceedingly.\r\n\r\n\"Hear me!\" cried the Ghost. \"My time is nearly gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" said Scrooge. \"But don't be hard upon me! Don't be flowery,\r\nJacob, pray!\"\r\n\r\n\"How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may\r\nnot tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered and wiped the\r\nperspiration from his brow.\r\n\r\n\"That is no light part of my penance,\" pursued the Ghost. \"I am here\r\nto-night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping\r\nmy fate. A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were always a good friend to me,\" said Scrooge. \"Thank'ee!\"\r\n\r\n\"You will be haunted,\" resumed the Ghost, \"by three spirits.\"\r\n\r\nScrooge's countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost's had done.\r\n\r\n\"Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?\" he demanded, in a\r\nfaltering voice.\r\n\r\n\"It is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I think I'd rather not,\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Without their visits,\" said the Ghost, \"you cannot hope to shun the\r\npath I tread. Expect the first to-morrow, when the bell tolls one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't I take 'em all at once and have it over, Jacob?\" hinted\r\nScrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Expect the second on the next night at the same hour. The third upon\r\nthe next night when the last stroke of twelve has ceased to vibrate.\r\nLook to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember\r\nwhat has passed between us!\"\r\n\r\nWhen it had said these words the Specter took its wrapper from the\r\ntable and bound it round its head as before. Scrooge knew this by the\r\nsmart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought together by the\r\nbandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again, and found his\r\nsupernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its\r\nchain wound over and about its arm.\r\n\r\nThe apparition walked backward from him and at every step it took the\r\nwindow raised itself a little, so that when the Specter reached it, it\r\nwas wide open.\r\n\r\nIt beckoned Scrooge to approach which he did. When they were within two\r\npaces of each other, Marley's Ghost held up its hand, warning him to\r\ncome no nearer. Scrooge stopped.\r\n\r\nNot so much in obedience as in surprise and fear; for on the raising of\r\nthe hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent\r\nsounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and\r\nself-accusatory. The Specter, after listening for a moment, joined in\r\nthe mournful dirge, and floated out upon the bleak, dark night.\r\n\r\nScrooge followed to the window, desperate in his curiosity. He looked\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in\r\nrestless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains\r\nlike Marley's Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were\r\nlinked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to\r\nScrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost\r\nin a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle,\r\nwho cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an\r\ninfant, whom it saw below, upon a door-step. The misery with them all\r\nwas clearly that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters,\r\nand had lost the power forever.\r\n\r\nWhether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he\r\ncould not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together, and\r\nthe night became as it had been when he walked home.\r\n\r\nScrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had\r\nentered. It was double-locked, as he had locked it with his own hands,\r\nand the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say \"Humbug!\" but stopped\r\nat the first syllable. And being--from the emotion he had undergone, or\r\nthe fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the invisible world, or the\r\ndull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour--much in\r\nneed of repose, went straight to bed without undressing, and fell\r\nasleep upon the instant.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAVE TWO.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS.\r\n\r\nWhen Scrooge awoke it was so dark that, looking out of bed, he could\r\nscarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of\r\nhis chamber. He was endeavoring to pierce the darkness with his ferret\r\neyes when the chimes of a neighboring church struck the four quarters.\r\nSo he listened for the hour.\r\n\r\nTo his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and\r\nfrom seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve!\r\nIt was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle\r\nmust have got into the works. Twelve!\r\n\r\nHe touched the spring of his repeater to correct this most preposterous\r\nclock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve, and stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it isn't possible,\" said Scrooge, \"that I can have slept through\r\na whole day and far into another night. It isn't possible that anything\r\nhas happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!\"\r\n\r\nThe idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his\r\nway to the window. He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve\r\nof his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very\r\nlittle then. All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy\r\nand extremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to\r\nand fro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have\r\nbeen if night had beaten off bright day and taken possession of the\r\nworld. This was a great relief, because \"three days after sight of this\r\nFirst of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,\" and so\r\nforth, would have become a mere United States' security if there were\r\nno days to count by.\r\n\r\nScrooge went to bed again and thought and thought, and thought it over\r\nand over and over, and could make nothing of it. The more he thought,\r\nthe more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavored not to think, the\r\nmore he thought.\r\n\r\nMarley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within\r\nhimself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his mind flew\r\nback again, like a strong spring released to its first position, and\r\npresented the same problem to be worked all through, \"Was it a dream or\r\nnot?\"\r\n\r\nScrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three-quarters more,\r\nwhen he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a\r\nvisitation when the bell tolled one. He resolved to lie awake until the\r\nhour was passed; and considering that he could no more go to sleep than\r\ngo to heaven, this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power.\r\n\r\nThe quarter was so long that he was more than once convinced he must\r\nhave sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock. At length it\r\nbroke upon his listening ear.\r\n\r\n\"Ding, dong!\"\r\n\r\n\"A quarter past,\" said Scrooge, counting.\r\n\r\n\"Ding, dong!\"\r\n\r\n\"Half-past!\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Ding, dong!\"\r\n\r\n\"A quarter to it,\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Ding, dong!\"\r\n\r\n\"The hour itself,\" said Scrooge, triumphantly, \"and nothing else!\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep,\r\ndull, hollow, melancholy ONE. Light flashed up in the room upon the\r\ninstant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.\r\n\r\nThe curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand. Not\r\nthe curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to\r\nwhich his face was addressed. The curtains of his bed were drawn aside;\r\nand Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself\r\nface to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them, as close to it\r\nas I am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange figure--like a child; yet not so like a child as like\r\nan old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the\r\nappearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a\r\nchild's proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its\r\nback, was white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in\r\nit, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were very long\r\nand muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon\r\nstrength. Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those\r\nupper members, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its\r\nwaist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It\r\nheld a branch of fresh, green holly in its hand, and in singular\r\ncontradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer\r\nflowers. But the strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of\r\nits head there sprung a bright, clear jet of light, by which all this\r\nwas visible; and which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its\r\nduller moments, a great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under\r\nits arm.\r\n\r\nEven this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing\r\nsteadiness, was _not_ its strangest quality. For as its belt sparkled\r\nand glittered now in one part and now in another, and what was light\r\none instant, at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated\r\nin its distinctness; being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg,\r\nnow with twenty legs, now a pair of legs without a head, now a head\r\nwithout a body, of which dissolving parts no outline would be visible\r\nin the dense gloom wherein they melted away. And in the very wonder of\r\nthis, it would be itself again; distinct and clear as ever.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me?\" asked\r\nScrooge.\r\n\r\n\"I am!\"\r\n\r\nThe voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if, instead of being\r\nso close beside him, it were at a distance.\r\n\r\n\"Who and what are you?\" Scrooge demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.\"\r\n\r\n\"Long past?\" inquired Scrooge, observant of its dwarfish stature.\r\n\r\n\"No; your past.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps Scrooge could not have told anybody why if anybody could have\r\nasked him, but he had a special desire to see the Spirit in his cap,\r\nand begged him to be covered.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed the Ghost, \"would you so soon put out, with worldly\r\nhands, the light I give? Is it not enough that you are one of those\r\nwhose passions made this cap, and force me through whole trains of\r\nyears to wear it low upon my brow!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge\r\nof having willfully \"bonneted\" the Spirit at any period of his life. He\r\nthen made bold to inquire what business brought him there.\r\n\r\n\"Your welfare!\" said the Ghost.\r\n\r\nScrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not help thinking\r\nthat a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that\r\nend. The Spirit must have heard him thinking, for it said immediately,\r\n\"Your reclamation, then. Take heed!\"\r\n\r\nIt put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him gently by the\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\"Rise, and walk with me!\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and\r\nthe hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that the bed was\r\nwarm, and the thermometer a long way below freezing; that he was clad\r\nbut lightly in his slippers, dressing-gown, and night-cap; and that he\r\nhad a cold upon him at that time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman's\r\nhand, was not to be resisted. He rose; but finding that the Spirit made\r\ntowards the window, clasped his robe in supplication.\r\n\r\n\"I am a mortal,\" Scrooge remonstrated, \"and liable to fall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bear but a touch of my hand _there_,\" said the Spirit, laying it\r\nupon his heart, \"and you shall be upheld in more than this!\"\r\n\r\nAs the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon\r\nan open country road, with fields on either hand. The city had entirely\r\nvanished. Not a vestige of it was to be seen. The darkness and the mist\r\nhad vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow\r\nupon the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Good heaven!\" said Scrooge, clasping his hands together as he looked\r\nabout him. \"I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!\"\r\n\r\nThe Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it had been\r\nlight and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man's sense\r\nof feeling. He was conscious of a thousand odors floating in the air,\r\neach one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and\r\ncares, long, long forgotten!\r\n\r\n\"Your lip is trembling,\" said the Ghost. \"And what is that upon your\r\ncheek?\"\r\n\r\nScrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a\r\npimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.\r\n\r\n\"You recollect the way?\" inquired the Spirit.\r\n\r\n\"Remember it!\" cried Scrooge, with fervor; \"I could walk it blindfold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!\" observed the Ghost.\r\n\"Let us go on.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked along the road. Scrooge recognizing every gate, and post,\r\nand tree, until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its\r\nbridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen\r\ntrotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other\r\nboys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys were\r\nin great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields\r\nwere so full of merry music that the crisp air laughed to hear it.\r\n\r\n\"These are but shadows of the things that have been,\" said the Ghost.\r\n\"They have no consciousness of us.\"\r\n\r\nThe jocund travelers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named\r\nthem every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them! Why\r\ndid his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past! Why\r\nwas he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry\r\nChristmas, as they parted at cross-roads and by-ways, for their several\r\nhomes! What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas!\r\nWhat good had it ever done to him?\r\n\r\n\"The school is not quite deserted,\" said the Ghost. \"A solitary child,\r\nneglected by his friends, is left there still.\"\r\n\r\nScrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.\r\n\r\nThey left the high-road by a well-remembered lane and soon approached a\r\nmansion of dull red brick, with a little weather-cock-surmounted cupola\r\non the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of\r\nbroken fortunes, for the spacious offices were little used, their walls\r\nwere damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed.\r\nFowls clucked and strutted in the stables, and the coach-houses and\r\nsheds were overrun with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient\r\nstate within; for entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the\r\nopen doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and\r\nvast. There was an earthy savor in the air, a chilly bareness in the\r\nplace, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by\r\ncandle-light, and not too much to eat.\r\n\r\nThey went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the\r\nback of the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare,\r\nmelancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and\r\ndesks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire, and\r\nScrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self\r\nas he used to be.\r\n\r\nNot a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice\r\nbehind the paneling, not a drip from the half-thawed water-spout in the\r\ndull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one\r\ndespondent poplar, not the idle swinging of an empty store-house door,\r\nno, not a clicking in the fire, but fell upon the head of Scrooge with\r\na softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self,\r\nintent upon his reading. Suddenly a man, in foreign garments--wonderfully\r\nreal and distinct to look at--stood outside the window, with an axe\r\nstuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's Ali Baba!\" Scrooge exclaimed, in ecstasy. \"It's dear old\r\nhonest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know! One Christmas time, when yonder\r\nsolitary child was left here all alone, he _did_ come, for the first\r\ntime, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,\" said Scrooge, \"and his\r\nwild brother, Orson; there they go! And what's his name, who was put\r\ndown in his drawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don't you see\r\nhim? And the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he\r\nis upon his head! Serve him right. I'm glad of it. What business had\r\n_he_ to be married to the Princess!\"\r\n\r\nTo hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such\r\nsubjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying,\r\nand to see his heightened and excited face, would have been a surprise\r\nto his business friends in the city, indeed.\r\n\r\n\"There's the parrot!\" cried Scrooge. \"Green body and yellow tail, with\r\na thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is!\r\nPoor Robin Crusoe, he called him, when he came home again after sailing\r\nround the island. 'Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin\r\nCrusoe?' The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't. It was the\r\nparrot, you know. There goes Friday, running for his life to the little\r\ncreek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!\"\r\n\r\nThen, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual\r\ncharacter, he said, in pity for his former self, \"Poor boy!\" and cried\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"I wish,\" Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking\r\nabout him, after drying his eyes with his cuff, \"--but it's too late\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" asked the Spirit.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said Scrooge. \"Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas\r\ncarol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something;\r\nthat's all.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ghost smiled, thoughtfully, and waved its hand, saying as it did\r\nso, \"Let us see another Christmas!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a\r\nlittle darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked;\r\nfragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were\r\nshown instead; but how all this was brought about, Scrooge knew no more\r\nthan you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything\r\nhad happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other\r\nboys had gone home for the jolly holidays.\r\n\r\nHe was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge\r\nlooked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced\r\nanxiously towards the door.\r\n\r\nIt opened, and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting\r\nin, and putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him,\r\naddressed him as her \"Dear, dear brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have come to bring you home, dear brother!\" said the child, clapping\r\nher tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. \"To bring you home, home,\r\nhome!\"\r\n\r\n\"Home, little Fan?\" returned the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" said the child, brimful of glee. \"Home for good and all. Home,\r\nforever and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be that\r\nhome's like heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was\r\ngoing to bed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might\r\ncome home; and he said yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring\r\nyou. And you're to be a man,\" said the child, opening her eyes, \"and\r\nare never to come back here; but first, we're to be together all the\r\nChristmas long, and have the merriest time in all the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are quite a woman, little Fan!\" exclaimed the boy.\r\n\r\nShe clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but\r\nbeing too little, laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him.\r\nThen she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the\r\ndoor; and he, nothing loth to go, accompanied her.\r\n\r\nA terrible voice in the hall cried, \"Bring down Master Scrooge's box,\r\nthere!\" and in the hall appeared the school-master himself, who glared\r\non Master Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a\r\ndreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him\r\nand his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlor\r\nthat ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and\r\nterrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he\r\nproduced a decanter of curiously light wine and a block of curiously\r\nheavy cake, and administered instalments of those dainties to the young\r\npeople; at the same time sending out a meager servant to offer a glass\r\nof \"something\" to the post-boy, who answered that he thanked the\r\ngentleman, but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had\r\nrather not. Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied onto the top\r\nof the chaise, the children bade the school-master good by right\r\nwillingly, and getting into it drove gayly down the garden sweep; the\r\nquick wheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves\r\nof the evergreens like spray.\r\n\r\n\"Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,\" said\r\nthe Ghost. \"But she had a large heart!\"\r\n\r\n\"So she had,\" cried Scrooge. \"You're right. I will not gainsay it,\r\nSpirit. God forbid!\"\r\n\r\n\"She died a woman,\" said the Ghost, \"and had, as I think, children.\"\r\n\r\n\"One child,\" Scrooge returned.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said the Ghost. \"Your nephew!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge seemed uneasy in his mind, and answered, briefly, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough they had but that moment left the school behind them, they\r\nwere now in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers\r\npassed and repassed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the\r\nway, and all the strife and tumult of a real city were. It was made\r\nplain enough, by the dressing of the shops, that here, too, it was\r\nChristmas time again; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted\r\nup.\r\n\r\nThe Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he\r\nknew it.\r\n\r\n\"Know it!\" said Scrooge. \"Was I apprenticed here!\"\r\n\r\nThey went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting\r\nbehind such a high desk that if he had been two inches taller he must\r\nhave knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great\r\nexcitement, \"Why, it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it's Fezziwig\r\nalive again!\"\r\n\r\nOld Fezziwig laid down his pen and looked up at the clock, which\r\npointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his\r\ncapacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his\r\norgan of benevolence; and called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat,\r\njovial voice, \"Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in,\r\naccompanied by his fellow-'prentice.\r\n\r\n\"Dick Wilkins, to be sure!\" said Scrooge to the Ghost. \"Bless me, yes.\r\nThere he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick!\r\nDear, dear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yo ho, my boys!\" said Fezziwig. \"No more work to-night. Christmas Eve,\r\nDick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let's have the shutters up,\" cried old\r\nFezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands, \"before a man can say Jack\r\nRobinson!\"\r\n\r\nYou wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged\r\ninto the street with the shutters--one, two, three--had 'em up in their\r\nplaces--four, five, six--barred 'em and pinned 'em--seven, eight,\r\nnine--and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like\r\nrace-horses.\r\n\r\n\"Hilli-ho!\" cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk, with\r\nwonderful agility. \"Clear away, my lads, and let's have lots of room\r\nhere! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!\"\r\n\r\nClear away! There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared away, or\r\ncouldn't have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done\r\nin a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from\r\npublic life forevermore, the floor was swept and watered, the lamps\r\nwere trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as\r\nsnug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room as you would desire to\r\nsee upon a winter's night.\r\n\r\nIn came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and\r\nmade an orchestra out of it, and tuned like fifty stomachaches. In came\r\nMrs. Fezziwig, one vast, substantial smile. In came the three Miss\r\nFezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose\r\nhearts they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the\r\nbusiness. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the baker. In came\r\nthe cook, with her brother's particular friend, the milkman. In came\r\nthe boy from over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough\r\nfrom his master; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door\r\nbut one, who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In\r\nthey all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some\r\ngracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all\r\ncame, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went, twenty couple at once;\r\nhands half round and back again the other way; down the middle and up\r\nagain; round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old\r\ntop couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top couple\r\nstarting off again, as soon as they got there; all top couples at last,\r\nand not a bottom one to help them! When this result was brought about,\r\nold Fezziwig, clapping his hands to stop the dance, cried out, \"Well\r\ndone!\" and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter\r\nespecially provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his\r\nreappearance, he instantly began again--though there were no dancers\r\nyet--as if the other fiddler had been carried home, exhausted, on a\r\nshutter, and he were a brand-new man, resolved to beat him out of sight\r\nor perish.\r\n\r\nThere were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and\r\nthere was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of\r\ncold roast, and there was a great piece of cold boiled, and there were\r\nmince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great effect of the evening\r\ncame after the roast and boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind!\r\nThe sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have\r\ntold it him!) struck up \"Sir Roger de Coverley.\" Then old Fezziwig\r\nstood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too, with a good,\r\nstiff piece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of\r\npartners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who _would_\r\ndance, and had no notion of walking.\r\n\r\nBut if they had been twice as many--ah, four times--old Fezziwig would\r\nhave been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig. As to _her_,\r\nshe was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that's\r\nnot high praise, tell me higher and I'll use it. A positive light\r\nappeared to issue from Fezziwig's calves. They shone in every part of\r\nthe dance like moons. You couldn't have predicted, at any given time,\r\nwhat would have become of them next. And when old Fezziwig and Mrs.\r\nFezziwig had gone all through the dance--advance and retire, both hands\r\nto your partner, bow and curtsey, cork-screw, thread-the-needle, and\r\nback again to your place--Fezziwig \"cut\"--cut so deftly that he\r\nappeared to wink with his legs, and came up on his feet again without a\r\nstagger.\r\n\r\nWhen the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nFezziwig took their stations, one on either side of the door, and\r\nshaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out,\r\nwished him or her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the\r\ntwo 'prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices\r\ndied away, and the lads were left to their beds, which were under a\r\ncounter in the back shop.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of this time Scrooge had acted like a man out of his\r\nwits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self.\r\nHe corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything,\r\nand underwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the\r\nbright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he\r\nremembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full\r\nupon him, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.\r\n\r\n\"A small matter,\" said the Ghost, \"to make these silly folks so full of\r\ngratitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"Small!\" echoed Scrooge.\r\n\r\nThe spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were\r\npouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig; and when he had done\r\nso, said, \"Why, is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal\r\nmoney--three or four, perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this\r\npraise?\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't that,\" said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking\r\nunconsciously like his former, not his latter self. \"It isn't that,\r\nSpirit. He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our\r\nservice light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power\r\nlies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it\r\nis impossible to add and count 'em up: what then? The happiness he\r\ngives is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.\"\r\n\r\nHe felt the Spirit's glance, and stopped.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" asked the Ghost.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing particular,\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Something, I think?\" the Ghost insisted.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Scrooge, \"No. I should like to be able to say a word or two\r\nto my clerk just now. That's all.\"\r\n\r\nHis former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish;\r\nand Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air.\r\n\r\n\"My time grows short,\" observed the Spirit. \"Quick!\"\r\n\r\nThis was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could see, but\r\nit produced an immediate effect. For again Scrooge saw himself. He was\r\nolder now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and\r\nrigid lines of later years, but it had begun to wear the signs of care\r\nand avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye,\r\nwhich showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of\r\nthe growing tree would fall.\r\n\r\nHe was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a\r\nmourning dress, in whose eyes there were tears which sparkled in the\r\nlight that shone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.\r\n\r\n\"It matters little,\" she said, softly. \"To you, very little. Another\r\nidol has displaced me, and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to\r\ncome as I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.\"\r\n\r\n\"What idol has displaced you?\" he rejoined.\r\n\r\n\"A golden one.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is the even-handed dealing of the world!\" he said. \"There is\r\nnothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it\r\nprofesses to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!\"\r\n\r\n\"You fear the world too much,\" she answered, gently. \"All your other\r\nhopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its\r\nsordid reproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by\r\none, until the master-passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\" he retorted. \"Even if I have grown so much wiser, what\r\nthen? I am not changed towards you.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"Am I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor and\r\ncontent to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly\r\nfortune by our patient industry. You _are_ changed. When it was made,\r\nyou were another man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was a boy,\" he said, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are,\" she\r\nreturned. \"I am. That which promised happiness when we were one in\r\nheart, is fraught with misery now that we are two. How often and how\r\nkeenly I have thought of this, I will not say. It is enough that I\r\n_have_ thought of it, and can release you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I ever sought release?\"\r\n\r\n\"In words. No, never.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere of\r\nlife; another hope as its great end. In everything that made my love of\r\nany worth or value in your sight. If this had ever been between us,\"\r\nsaid the girl, looking mildly, but with steadiness upon him, \"tell me,\r\nwould you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in spite of\r\nhimself. But he said, with a struggle, \"You think not.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would gladly think otherwise if I could,\" she answered, \"heaven\r\nknows! When _I_ have learned a truth like this, I know how strong\r\nand irresistible it must be. But if you were free to-day, to-morrow,\r\nyesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless\r\ngirl--you who, in your very confidence with her, weigh everything by\r\ngain; or choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your\r\none guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your repentance and\r\nregret would surely follow? I do; and I release you, with a full heart,\r\nfor the love of him you once were.\"\r\n\r\nHe was about to speak; but with her head turned from him, she resumed.\r\n\"You may--the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will--have\r\npain in this. A very, very brief time, and you will dismiss the\r\nrecollection of it gladly, as an unprofitable dream, from which it\r\nhappened well that you awoke. May you be happy in the life you have\r\nchosen!\"\r\n\r\nShe left him and they parted.\r\n\r\n\"Spirit!\" said Scrooge, \"show me no more! Conduct me home. Why do you\r\ndelight to torture me?\"\r\n\r\n\"One shadow more!\" exclaimed the Ghost.\r\n\r\n\"No more!\" cried Scrooge. \"No more. I don't wish to see it. Show me no\r\nmore!\"\r\n\r\nBut the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him\r\nto observe what happened next.\r\n\r\nThey were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or\r\nhandsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful\r\nyoung girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same,\r\nuntil he saw _her_, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter.\r\nThe noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more\r\nchildren there than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;\r\nand unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, there were not forty\r\nchildren conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting\r\nitself like forty. The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but\r\nno one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed\r\nheartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to\r\nmingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most\r\nruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of them. Though I\r\nnever could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn't for the wealth of all\r\nthe world have crushed that braided hair and torn it down; and for the\r\nprecious little shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my\r\nsoul! to save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did,\r\nbold young brood, I couldn't have done it; I should have expected my\r\narm to have grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight\r\nagain. And yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her\r\nlips; to have questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have\r\nlooked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush;\r\nto have let loose waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake\r\nbeyond price; in short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had\r\nthe lightest license of a child, and yet to have been man enough to\r\nknow its value.\r\n\r\nBut now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a rush immediately\r\nensued that she, with laughing face and plundered dress, was borne\r\ntowards it, the center of a flushed and boisterous group, just in time\r\nto greet the father, who came home attended by a man laden with\r\nChristmas toys and presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and\r\nthe onslaught that was made on the defenseless porter! The scaling him\r\nwith chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets, despoil him of brown\r\npaper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his neck,\r\npommel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The\r\nshouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every\r\npackage was received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been\r\ntaken in the act of putting a doll's frying-pan into his mouth, and was\r\nmore than suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey glued on a\r\nwooden platter! The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The\r\njoy, and gratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike. It\r\nis enough that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of\r\nthe parlor, and by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house,\r\nwhere they went to bed, and so subsided.\r\n\r\nAnd now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master\r\nof the house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with\r\nher and her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such\r\nanother creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have\r\ncalled him father, and been a springtime in the haggard winter of his\r\nlife, his sight grew very dim indeed.\r\n\r\n\"Belle,\" said the husband, turning to his wife, with a smile, \"I saw an\r\nold friend of yours this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess!\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I? Tut, don't I know,\" she added, in the same breath, laughing\r\nas he laughed. \"Mr. Scrooge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window, and as it was not shut\r\nup and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him. His\r\npartner lies upon the point of death, I hear, and there he sat alone.\r\nQuite alone in the world, I do believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spirit!\" said Scrooge, in a broken voice, \"remove me from this place.\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,\" said the\r\nGhost. \"That they are what they are, do not blame me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Remove me!\" Scrooge exclaimed, \"I cannot bear it!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a\r\nface, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the\r\nfaces it had shown him, wrestled with it.\r\n\r\n\"Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!\"\r\n\r\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost\r\nwith no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any\r\neffort of its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning\r\nhigh and bright, and dimly connecting that with its influence over him,\r\nhe seized the extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down\r\nupon its head.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\r\nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\r\ncould not hide the light which streamed from under it in an unbroken\r\nflood upon the ground.\r\n\r\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\r\ndrowsiness; and further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a\r\nparting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed, and had barely time to reel\r\nto bed before he sank into a heavy sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAVE THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS.\r\n\r\nAwaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in\r\nbed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told\r\nthat the bell was again upon the stroke of one. He felt that he was\r\nrestored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial\r\npurpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to\r\nhim through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he turned\r\nuncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this\r\nnew specter would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own\r\nhands, and lying down again, established a sharp lookout all round the\r\nbed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\r\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise, and made nervous.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\r\nacquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time of\r\nday, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by\r\nobserving that they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to\r\nmanslaughter, between which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a\r\ntolerably wide and comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing\r\nfor Scrooge quite as hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to\r\nbelieve that he was ready for a good, broad field of strange\r\nappearances, and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have\r\nastonished him very much.\r\n\r\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means\r\nprepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck one, and\r\nno shape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five\r\nminutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.\r\nAll this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and center of a blaze\r\nof ruddy light which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\r\nhour, and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen\r\nghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at,\r\nand was sometimes apprehensive that he might be that very moment an\r\ninteresting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the\r\nconsolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you\r\nor I would have thought at first, for it is always the person not in\r\nthe predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would\r\nunquestionably have done it, too--at last, I say, he began to think\r\nthat the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the\r\nadjoining room, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine.\r\nThis idea taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly and\r\nshuffled in his slippers to the door.\r\n\r\nThe moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock, a strange voice called him\r\nby his name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\r\n\r\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had\r\nundergone a surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so\r\nhung with living green that it looked a perfect grove, from every part\r\nof which bright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly,\r\nmistletoe, and ivy reflected back the light as if so many little\r\nmirrors had been scattered there, and such a mighty blaze went roaring\r\nup the chimney as that dull petrifaction of a hearth had never known in\r\nScrooge's time, or Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone.\r\nHeaped up on the floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese,\r\ngame, poultry, brawn, great joints of meat, sucking pigs, long wreaths\r\nof sausages, mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot\r\nchestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears,\r\nimmense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the\r\nchamber dim with their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch,\r\nthere sat a jolly giant, glorious to see, who bore a glowing torch, in\r\nshape not unlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its\r\nlight on Scrooge as he came peeping round the door.\r\n\r\n\"Come in!\" exclaimed the Ghost. \"Come in! and know me better, man!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge entered, timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was\r\nnot the dogged Scrooge he had been, and though the Spirit's eyes were\r\nclear and kind, he did not like to meet them.\r\n\r\n\"I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,\" said the Spirit. \"Look upon me!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple green robe, or\r\nmantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the\r\nfigure that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be\r\nwarded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the\r\nample folds of the garment, were also bare, and on its head it wore no\r\nother covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\r\nicicles. Its dark brown curls were long and free--free as its genial\r\nface, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its\r\nunconstrained demeanor, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was\r\nan antique scabbard, but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was\r\neaten up with rust.\r\n\r\n\"You have never seen the like of me before!\" exclaimed the Spirit.\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" Scrooge made answer to it.\r\n\r\n\"Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family, meaning\r\n(for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?\"\r\npursued the Phantom.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I have,\" said Scrooge. \"I am afraid I have not. Have you\r\nhad many brothers, Spirit?\"\r\n\r\n\"More than eighteen hundred,\" said the Ghost.\r\n\r\n\"A tremendous family to provide for!\" muttered Scrooge.\r\n\r\nThe Ghost of Christmas Present rose.\r\n\r\n\"Spirit,\" said Scrooge, submissively, \"conduct me where you will. I\r\nwent forth last night on compulsion, and I learnt a lesson which is\r\nworking now. To-night, if you have aught to teach me, let me profit by\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Touch my robe!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.\r\n\r\nHolly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\r\nbrawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings, fruit, and punch\r\nall vanished instantly. So did the room, the fire, the ruddy glow, the\r\nhour of night, and they stood in the city streets on Christmas morning,\r\nwhere (for the weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk\r\nand not unpleasant kind of music in scraping the snow from the pavement\r\nin front of their dwellings, and from the tops of their houses, whence\r\nit was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the\r\nroad below, and splitting into artificial little snow-storms.\r\n\r\nThe house fronts looked black enough, and the windows blacker,\r\ncontrasting with the smooth, white sheet of snow upon the roofs, and\r\nwith the dirtier snow upon the ground; which last deposit had been\r\nploughed up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and\r\nwagons--furrows that crossed and re-crossed each other hundreds of\r\ntimes where the great streets branched off, and made intricate channels\r\nhard to trace in the thick, yellow mud and icy water. The sky was\r\ngloomy and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist, half\r\nthawed, half frozen, whose heavier particles descended in a shower of\r\nsooty atoms, as if all the chimneys in Great Britain had, by one\r\nconsent, caught fire, and were blazing away to their dear hearts'\r\ncontent. There was nothing very cheerful in the climate of the town,\r\nand yet was there an air of cheerfulness abroad that the clearest\r\nsummer air and brightest summer sun might have endeavored to diffuse in\r\nvain. For the people who were shoveling away on the housetops were\r\njovial and full of glee; calling out to one another from the parapets,\r\nand now and then exchanging a facetious snowball--better-natured\r\nmissile far than many a wordy jest--laughing heartily if it went right,\r\nand not less heartily if it went wrong. The poulterers' shops were\r\nstill half open, and the fruiterers' were radiant in their glory. There\r\nwere great, round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the\r\nwaistcoats of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling\r\nout into the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were ruddy,\r\nbrown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish onions, shining in the fatness of\r\ntheir growth like Spanish friars, and winking from their shelves in\r\nwanton slyness at the girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at\r\nthe hung-up mistletoe. There were pears and apples clustered high in\r\nblooming pyramids; there were bunches of grapes made, in the\r\nshopkeepers' benevolence, to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that\r\npeople's mouths might water gratis as they passed; there were piles of\r\nfilberts, mossy and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks\r\namong the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered\r\nleaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squab and swarthy, setting off the\r\nyellow of the oranges and lemons, and in the great compactness of their\r\njuicy persons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in\r\npaper bags and eaten after dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set\r\nforth among these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and\r\nstagnant blooded race, appeared to know that there was something going\r\non, and to a fish went gasping round and round their little world in\r\nslow and passionless excitement.\r\n\r\nThe grocers'! oh the grocers'! nearly closed, with perhaps two shutters\r\ndown, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses! It was not alone\r\nthat the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound, or that\r\nthe twine and roller parted company so briskly, or that the canisters\r\nwere rattled up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended\r\nscents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even that the\r\nraisins were so plentiful and pure, the almonds so extremely white, the\r\nsticks of cinnamon so long and straight, the other spices so delicious,\r\nthe candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make\r\nthe coldest lookers-on feel faint and subsequently bilious. Nor was it\r\nthat the figs were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in\r\nmodest tartness from their highly decorated boxes, or that everything\r\nwas good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but the customers were all\r\nso hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day, that they\r\ntumbled up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker\r\nbaskets wildly, and left their purchases upon the counter, and came\r\nrunning back to fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like\r\nmistakes, in the best humor possible; while the grocer and his people\r\nwere so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they\r\nfastened their aprons behind might have been their own, worn outside\r\nfor general inspection, and for Christmas daws to peck at if they\r\nchose.\r\n\r\nBut soon the steeples called good people all to church and chapel, and\r\naway they came, flocking through the streets in their best clothes, and\r\nwith their gayest faces. At the same time there emerged from scores of\r\nby-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying\r\ntheir dinners to the bakers' shops. The sight of these poor revelers\r\nappeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with Scrooge\r\nbeside him in a baker's doorway, and taking off the covers as their\r\nbearers passed, sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch. And\r\nit was a very uncommon kind of torch, for once or twice when there were\r\nangry words between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he\r\nshed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good humor was\r\nrestored directly, for they said, it was a shame to quarrel upon\r\nChristmas Day. And so it was! God love it, so it was!\r\n\r\nIn time the bells ceased and the bakers were shut up; and yet there was\r\na genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their\r\ncooking in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker's oven, where the\r\npavement smoked as if the stones were cooking, too.\r\n\r\n\"Is there a peculiar flavor in what you sprinkle from your torch?\"\r\nasked Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"There is; my own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?\" asked Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"To any kindly given. To a poor one most.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why to a poor one most?\" asked Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Because it needs it most.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spirit,\" said Scrooge, after a moment's thought, \"I wonder you, of all\r\nthe beings in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp these\r\npeople's opportunities of innocent enjoyment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I!\" cried the Spirit.\r\n\r\n\"You would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day,\r\noften the only day on which they can be said to dine at all,\" said\r\nScrooge, \"wouldn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I!\" cried the Spirit.\r\n\r\n\"You seek to close these places on the seventh day,\" said Scrooge, \"and\r\nit comes to the same thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ seek!\" exclaimed the Spirit.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your name, or at least\r\nin that of your family,\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"There are some upon this earth of yours,\" returned the Spirit, \"who\r\nlay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride,\r\nill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are\r\nas strange to us and all our kith and kin as if they had never lived.\r\nRemember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.\"\r\n\r\nScrooge promised that he would, and they went on, invisible, as they\r\nhad been before, into the suburbs of the town. It was a remarkable\r\nquality of the Ghost (which Scrooge had observed at the baker's), that\r\nnotwithstanding his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any\r\nplace with ease, and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as\r\ngracefully and like a supernatural creature as it was possible he could\r\nhave done in any lofty hall.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this\r\npower of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and\r\nhis sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge's\r\nclerk's; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his\r\nrobe; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped\r\nto bless Bob Cratchit's dwelling with the sprinklings of his torch.\r\nThink of that! Bob had but fifteen \"Bob\" a-week himself; he pocketed on\r\nSaturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost\r\nof Christmas Present blessed his four-roomed house!\r\n\r\nThen up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out but poorly in\r\na twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap and make a\r\ngoodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda\r\nCratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master\r\nPeter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and\r\ngetting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob's private\r\nproperty, conferred upon his son and heir in honor of the day) into his\r\nmouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to\r\nshow his linen in the fashionable parks. And now two smaller Cratchits,\r\nboy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker's they\r\nhad smelt the goose and known it for their own, and basking in\r\nluxurious thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced\r\nabout the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while\r\nhe (not proud, although his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire\r\nuntil the slow potatoes bubbling up knocked loudly at the saucepan lid\r\nto be led out and peeled.\r\n\r\n\"What has ever got your precious father then?\" said Mrs. Cratchit. \"And\r\nyour brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha warn't as late last Christmas Day by\r\nhalf an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here's Martha, mother!\" said a girl, appearing as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Here's Martha, mother!\" cried the two young Cratchits. \"Hurrah!\r\nThere's _such_ a goose, Martha!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!\" said Mrs.\r\nCratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and\r\nbonnet for her with officious zeal.\r\n\r\n\"We'd a deal of work to finish up last night,\" replied the girl, \"and\r\nhad to clear away this morning, mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, never mind so long as you are come,\" said Mrs. Cratchit. \"Sit ye\r\ndown before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! There's father coming,\" cried the two young Cratchits, who\r\nwere everywhere at once. \"Hide, Martha, hide!\"\r\n\r\nSo Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at\r\nleast three feet of comforter, exclusive of the fringe, hanging down\r\nbefore him, and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed to look\r\nseasonable, and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore\r\na little crutch and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!\r\n\r\n\"Why, where's our Martha?\" cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.\r\n\r\n\"Not coming,\" said Mrs. Cratchit.\r\n\r\n\"Not coming!\" said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits,\r\nfor he had been Tim's blood horse all the way from church, and had come\r\nhome rampant; \"not coming upon Christmas Day!\"\r\n\r\nMartha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only a joke, so\r\nshe came out prematurely from behind the closet door and ran into his\r\narms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim and bore him off\r\ninto the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the\r\ncopper.\r\n\r\n\"And how did little Tim behave?\" asked Mrs. Cratchit, when she had\r\nrallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his\r\nheart's content.\r\n\r\n\"As good as gold,\" said Bob, \"and better. Somehow he gets thoughtful,\r\nsitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever\r\nheard. He told me coming home that he hoped the people saw him in the\r\nchurch, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to\r\nremember upon Christmas Day who made lame beggars walk and blind men\r\nsee.\"\r\n\r\nBob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more\r\nwhen he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.\r\n\r\nHis active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny\r\nTim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and sister\r\nto his stool before the fire, and while Bob, turning up his cuffs--as\r\nif, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more shabby--compounded\r\nsome hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round and\r\nround and put it on the hob to simmer, Master Peter and the two ubiquitous\r\nyoung Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which they soon returned\r\nin high procession.\r\n\r\nSuch a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of\r\nall birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter\r\nof course--and in truth it was something very like it in that house.\r\nMrs. Cratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan)\r\nhissing hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigor;\r\nMiss Belinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot\r\nplates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the\r\ntwo young Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting\r\nthemselves, and mounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into\r\ntheir mouths, lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came\r\nto be helped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It\r\nwas succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly\r\nall along the carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but\r\nwhen she did, and when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth,\r\none murmur of delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim,\r\nexcited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle\r\nof his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!\r\n\r\nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe there ever was\r\nsuch a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavor, size and cheapness,\r\nwere the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple sauce and\r\nmashed potatoes it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family;\r\nindeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small\r\natom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last! Yet\r\nevery one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits in particular were\r\nsteeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being\r\nchanged by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous\r\nto bear witnesses--to take the pudding up and bring it in.\r\n\r\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in\r\nturning out! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back\r\nyard and stolen it while they were merry with the goose--a supposition\r\nat which the two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors\r\nwere supposed.\r\n\r\nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A\r\nsmell like a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an\r\neating-house and a pastry-cook's next door to each other, with a\r\nlaundress's next door to that! That was the pudding. In half a minute\r\nMrs. Cratchit entered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding,\r\nlike a speckled canon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half\r\na-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck\r\ninto the top.\r\n\r\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly, too, that he\r\nregarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since\r\ntheir marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that now the weight was off her\r\nmind, she would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity of\r\nflour. Everybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or\r\nthought it was at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have\r\nbeen flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at\r\nsuch a thing.\r\n\r\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth\r\nswept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted and\r\nconsidered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a\r\nshovelful of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew\r\nround the hearth, in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a\r\none, and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass: two\r\ntumblers and a custard-cup without a handle.\r\n\r\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden\r\ngoblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks,\r\nwhile the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob\r\nproposed: \"A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!\"\r\n\r\nWhich all the family re-echoed.\r\n\r\n\"God bless us every one!\" said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\r\n\r\nHe sat very close to his father's side upon his little stool. Bob held\r\nhis withered little hand in his, as if he loved the child, and wished\r\nto keep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.\r\n\r\n\"Spirit,\" said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before,\r\n\"tell me if Tiny Tim will live.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see a vacant seat,\" replied the Ghost, \"in the poor chimney-corner,\r\nand a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows\r\nremain unaltered by the future, the child will die.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Scrooge. \"Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.\"\r\n\r\n\"If these shadows remain unaltered by the future, none other of my\r\nrace,\" returned the Ghost, \"will find him here. What then? If he be\r\nlike to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.\"\r\n\r\nScrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and\r\nwas overcome with penitence and grief.\r\n\r\n\"Man,\" said the Ghost, \"if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear\r\nthat wicked cant until you have discovered What the surplus is, and\r\nWhere is it. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die?\r\nIt may be that, in the sight of heaven, you are more worthless and less\r\nfit to live than millions like this poor man's child. Oh, God, to hear\r\nthe insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his\r\nhungry brothers in the dust!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke, and trembling, cast his eyes\r\nupon the ground. But he raised them speedily on hearing his own name.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Scrooge!\" said Bob; \"I'll give you Mr. Scrooge, the founder of the\r\nfeast!\"\r\n\r\n\"The founder of the feast, indeed!\" cried Mrs. Cratchit, reddening. \"I\r\nwish I had him here. I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and\r\nI hope he'd have a good appetite for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" said Bob, \"the children! Christmas Day.\"\r\n\r\n\"It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,\" said she, \"on which one drinks\r\nthe health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr.\r\nScrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than you do,\r\npoor fellow!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" was Bob's mild answer, \"Christmas Day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll drink his health for your sake and the day's,\" said Mrs.\r\nCratchit, \"not for his. Long life to him! A Merry Christmas and a Happy\r\nNew Year! He'll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt!\"\r\n\r\nThe children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their\r\nproceedings which had no heartiness. Tiny Tim drank it last of all, but\r\nhe didn't care twopence for it. Scrooge was the Ogre of the family. The\r\nmention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which was not\r\ndispelled for full five minutes.\r\n\r\nAfter it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than before, from\r\nthe mere relief of Scrooge the baleful being done with. Bob Cratchit\r\ntold them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which\r\nwould bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two\r\nyoung Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man\r\nof business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from\r\nbetween his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular\r\ninvestments he should favor when he came into the receipt of that\r\nbewildering income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner's,\r\nthen told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she\r\nworked at a stretch, and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning\r\nfor a good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home.\r\nAlso how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how\r\nthe lord \"was much about as tall as Peter\"; at which Peter pulled up\r\nhis collars so high that you couldn't have seen his head if you had\r\nbeen there. All this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and\r\nround, and by and by they had a song, about a lost child traveling in\r\nthe snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it\r\nvery well indeed.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome\r\nfamily; they were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being\r\nwaterproof; their clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and\r\nvery likely did, the inside of a pawnbroker's. But they were happy,\r\ngrateful, pleased with one another, and contented with the time; and\r\nwhen they faded and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the\r\nSpirit's torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and\r\nespecially on Tiny Tim, until the last.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was getting dark and snowing pretty heavily, and as\r\nScrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the\r\nroaring fires in kitchens, parlors, and all sorts of rooms was\r\nwonderful. Here the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a\r\ncozy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the\r\nfire, and deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and\r\ndarkness. There all the children of the house were running out into the\r\nsnow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts,\r\nand be the first to greet them. Here, again, were shadows on the\r\nwindowblind of guests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls,\r\nall hooded and fur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly\r\noff to some near neighbor's house, where, woe upon the single man who\r\nsaw them enter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!\r\n\r\nBut if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to\r\nfriendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to\r\ngive them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting\r\ncompany, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it,\r\nhow the Ghost exulted. How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened\r\nits capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with a generous hand,\r\nits bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very\r\nlamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of\r\nlight, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out\r\nloudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that\r\nhe had any company but Christmas!\r\n\r\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a\r\nbleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast\r\nabout, as though it were the burial-place of giants, and water spread\r\nitself wheresoever it listed, or would have done so, but for the frost\r\nthat held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse,\r\nrank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\r\nred, which glared upon the desolation for an instant like a sullen eye,\r\nand frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of\r\ndarkest night.\r\n\r\n\"What place is this?\" asked Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"A place where miners live, who labor in the bowels of the earth,\"\r\nreturned the Spirit. \"But they know me. See!\"\r\n\r\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced\r\ntowards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a\r\ncheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and\r\nwoman, with their children and their children's children, and another\r\ngeneration beyond that, all decked out gayly in their holiday attire.\r\nThe old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind\r\nupon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song--it had been a\r\nvery old song when he was a boy--and from time to time they all joined\r\nin the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got\r\nquite blithe and loud, and so surely as they stopped, his vigor sank\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and\r\npassing on above the moor, sped--whither? Not to sea? To sea. To\r\nScrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a\r\nfrightful range of rocks behind them, and his ears were deafened by the\r\nthundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the\r\ndreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore,\r\non which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there\r\nstood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base,\r\nand storm birds--born of the wind one might suppose, as seaweed of the\r\nwater--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\r\n\r\nBut even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that\r\nthrough the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of\r\nbrightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough\r\ntable at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in\r\ntheir can of grog; and one of them--the elder, too, with his face all\r\ndamaged and scarred with hard weather, as the figurehead of an old ship\r\nmight be--struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself.\r\n\r\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on,\r\non--until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they\r\nlighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the\r\nlookout in the bow, the officers who had the watch--dark, ghostly\r\nfigures in their several stations; but every man among them hummed a\r\nChristmas tune, or had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath\r\nto his companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes\r\nbelonging to it. And every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or\r\nbad, had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in\r\nthe year; and had shared to some extent in its festivities; and had\r\nremembered those he cared for at a distance; and had known that they\r\ndelighted to remember him.\r\n\r\nIt was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of\r\nthe wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through\r\nthe lonely darkness over an unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as\r\nprofound as death, it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus\r\nengaged to hear a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to\r\nScrooge to recognize it as his own nephew's and to find himself in a\r\nbright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his\r\nside, and looking at that same nephew with approving affability!\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha!\" laughed Scrooge's nephew. \"Ha, ha, ha!\"\r\n\r\nIf you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blest\r\nin a laugh than Scrooge's nephew, all I can say is, I should like to\r\nknow him, too. Introduce him to me, and I'll cultivate his\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\nIt is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there\r\nis infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so\r\nirresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. When Scrooge's\r\nnephew laughed in this way--holding his sides, rolling his head, and\r\ntwisting his face into the most extravagant contortions--Scrooge's\r\nniece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he, and their assembled\r\nfriends being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!\" cried Scrooge's\r\nnephew. \"He believed it, too!\"\r\n\r\n\"More shame for him, Fred!\" said Scrooge's niece, indignantly. Bless\r\nthose women; they never do anything by halves, they are always in\r\nearnest.\r\n\r\nShe was very pretty, exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled,\r\nsurprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth that seemed made\r\nto be kissed, as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about\r\nher chin that melted into one another when she laughed; and the\r\nsunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature's head.\r\nAltogether she was what you would have called provoking, you know; but\r\nsatisfactory, too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\"He's a comical old fellow,\" said Scrooge's nephew, \"that's the truth,\r\nand not so pleasant as he might be. However, his offenses carry their\r\nown punishment, and I have nothing to say against him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure he is very rich, Fred,\" hinted Scrooge's niece. \"At least you\r\nalways tell _me_ so.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of that, my dear!\" said Scrooge's nephew. \"His wealth is of no\r\nuse to him. He don't do any good with it. He don't make himself\r\ncomfortable with it. He hasn't the satisfaction of thinking--ha, ha,\r\nha!--that he is ever going to benefit us with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no patience with him,\" observed Scrooge's niece. Scrooge's\r\nniece's sisters and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I have!\" said Scrooge's nephew. \"I am sorry for him; I couldn't be\r\nangry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims! Himself,\r\nalways. Here, he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he won't\r\ncome and dine with us. What's the consequence? He don't lose much of a\r\ndinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,\" interrupted Scrooge's\r\nniece. Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have\r\nbeen competent judges, because they had just had dinner, and with the\r\ndessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm very glad to hear it,\" said Scrooge's nephew, \"because I\r\nhaven't great faith in these young housekeepers. What do _you_ say,\r\nTopper?\"\r\n\r\nTopper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge's niece's sisters,\r\nfor he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who had no\r\nright to express an opinion on the subject. Whereas Scrooge's niece's\r\nsister--the plump one with the lace tucker; not the one with the\r\nroses--blushed.\r\n\r\n\"Do go on, Fred,\" said Scrooge's niece, clapping her hands. \"He never\r\nfinishes what he begins to say; he is such a ridiculous fellow!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge's nephew reveled in another laugh, and as it was impossible to\r\nkeep the infection off--though the plump sister tried hard to do it\r\nwith aromatic vinegar--his example was unanimously followed.\r\n\r\n\"I was only going to say,\" said Scrooge's nephew, \"that the consequence\r\nof his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with us, is, as I\r\nthink, that he loses some pleasant moments which could do him no harm.\r\nI am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own\r\nthoughts, either in his moldy old office or his dusty chambers. I mean\r\nto give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for\r\nI pity him. He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can't help\r\nthinking better of it--I defy him--if he finds me going there, in good\r\ntemper, year after year, and saying, Uncle Scrooge, how are you? If it\r\nonly puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds,\r\n_that's_ something, and I think I shook him yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nIt was their turn to laugh now, at the notion of his shaking Scrooge.\r\nBut being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they\r\nlaughed at so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in\r\ntheir merriment and passed the bottle joyously.\r\n\r\nAfter tea, they had some music, for they were a musical family, and\r\nknew what they were about, when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure\r\nyou, especially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good\r\none, and never swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the\r\nface over it. Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp, and played\r\namong other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing--you might learn\r\nto whistle it in two minutes), which had been familiar to the child who\r\nfetched Scrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by\r\nthe Ghost of Christmas Past. When the strain of music sounded, all the\r\nthings that Ghost had shown him came upon his mind, he softened more\r\nand more, and thought that if he could have listened to it often years\r\nago, he might have cultivated the kindness of life for his own\r\nhappiness with his own hands, without resorting to the sexton's spade\r\nthat buried Jacob Marley.\r\n\r\nBut they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After a while they\r\nplayed at forfeits, for it is good to be children sometimes, and never\r\nbetter than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself.\r\nStop! There was first a game at blind-man's buff. Of course there was.\r\nAnd I no more believe that Topper was really blind than I believe he\r\nhad eyes in his boots. My opinion is that it was a done thing between\r\nhim and Scrooge's nephew, and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew\r\nit. The way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an\r\noutrage on the credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons,\r\ntumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano, smothering himself\r\namong the curtains, wherever she went, there went he! He always knew\r\nwhere the plump sister was. He wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had\r\nfallen up against him (as some of them did on purpose), he would have\r\nmade a feint of endeavoring to seize you, which would have been an\r\naffront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in\r\nthe direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn't\r\nfair, and it really was not. But when at last he caught her; when, in\r\nspite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him,\r\nhe got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct\r\nwas the most execrable. For his pretending not to know her, his\r\npretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further\r\nto assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her\r\nfinger, and a certain chain about her neck, was vile, monstrous! No\r\ndoubt she told him her opinion of it, when, another blind man being in\r\noffice, they were so very confidential together behind the curtains.\r\n\r\nScrooge's niece was not one of the blind-man's buff party, but was made\r\ncomfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner, where\r\nthe Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the\r\nforfeits and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the\r\nalphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very\r\ngreat, and to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat her sisters\r\nhollow, though they were sharp girls, too, as Topper could have told\r\nyou. There might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they\r\nall played, and so did Scrooge, for wholly forgetting, in the interest\r\nhe had in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their\r\nears, he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often\r\nguessed quite right, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel,\r\nwarranted not to cut in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as\r\nhe took it in his head to be.\r\n\r\nThe Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood, and looked upon\r\nhim with such favor that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay\r\nuntil the guests departed. But this the Spirit said could not be done.\r\n\r\n\"Here is a new game,\" said Scrooge. \"One half-hour, Spirit, only one!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew had to think of\r\nsomething, and the rest must find out what; he only answering to their\r\nquestions yes or no, as the case was. The brisk fire of questioning to\r\nwhich he was exposed elicited from him that he was thinking of an\r\nanimal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal,\r\nan animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes, and\r\nlived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn't made a show\r\nof, and wasn't led by anybody, and didn't live in a menagerie, and was\r\nnever killed in a market, and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or\r\na bull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every\r\nfresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar\r\nof laughter, and was so inexpressibly tickled that he was obliged to\r\nget up off the sofa and stamp. At last the plump sister, falling into a\r\nsimilar state, cried out, \"I have found it out! I know what it is,\r\nFred! I know what it is!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" cried Fred.\r\n\r\n\"It's your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!\"\r\n\r\nWhich it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment, though\r\nsome objected that the reply to \"Is it a bear?\" ought to have been\r\n\"Yes,\" inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have\r\ndiverted their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had\r\nany tendency that way.\r\n\r\n\"He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure,\" said Fred, \"and it\r\nwould be ungrateful not to drink his health. Here is a glass of mulled\r\nwine ready to our hand at the moment; and I say, 'Uncle Scrooge!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well! Uncle Scrooge!\" they cried.\r\n\r\n\"A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old man, whatever he\r\nis!\" said Scrooge's nephew. \"He wouldn't take it from me, but may he\r\nhave it, nevertheless. Uncle Scrooge!\"\r\n\r\nUncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart that\r\nhe would have pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked\r\nthem in an inaudible speech if the Ghost had given him time. But the\r\nwhole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his\r\nnephew, and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.\r\n\r\nMuch they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but\r\nalways with a happy end. The Spirit stood beside sick beds, and they\r\nwere cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by\r\nstruggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by\r\npoverty, and it was rich. In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery's\r\nevery refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made\r\nfast the door and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing and\r\ntaught Scrooge his precepts.\r\n\r\nIt was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his\r\ndoubts of this, because the Christmas holidays appeared to be condensed\r\ninto the space of time they passed together. It was strange, too, that\r\nwhile Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew\r\nolder, clearly older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke\r\nof it until they left a children's Twelfth-Night party, when, looking\r\nat the Spirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that\r\nits hair was gray.\r\n\r\n\"Are spirits' lives so short?\" asked Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"My life upon this globe is very brief,\" replied the Ghost. \"It ends\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-night!\" cried Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"To-night at midnight. Hark! The time is drawing near.\"\r\n\r\nThe chimes were ringing the three-quarters past eleven at that moment.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,\" said Scrooge, looking\r\nintently at the Spirit's robe, \"but I see something strange, and not\r\nbelonging to yourself, protruding from your skirts. Is it a foot or a\r\nclaw?\"\r\n\r\n\"It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,\" was the Spirit's\r\nsorrowful reply. \"Look here.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched,\r\nabject, frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and\r\nclung upon the outside of its garment.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, man! look here. Look, look down here!\" exclaimed the Ghost.\r\n\r\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meager, ragged, scowling, wolfish,\r\nbut prostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\r\nfilled their features out and touched them with its freshest tints, a\r\nstale and shriveled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\r\nthem, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\r\nenthroned, devils lurked and glared out menacing. No change, no\r\ndegradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the\r\nmysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and\r\ndread.\r\n\r\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way,\r\nhe tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked\r\nthemselves rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\r\n\r\n\"Spirit, are they yours?\" Scrooge could say no more.\r\n\r\n\"They are man's,\" said the Spirit, looking down upon them, \"and they\r\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\r\ngirl is Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of\r\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\r\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!\" cried the Spirit, stretching\r\nout its hand towards the city. \"Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it\r\nfor your factious purposes, and make it worse. And abide the end!\"\r\n\r\n\"Have they no refuge or resource?\" cried Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Are there no prisons?\" said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\r\ntime with his own words. \"Are there no workhouses?\"\r\n\r\nThe bell struck twelve.\r\n\r\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\r\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\r\nMarley, and lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\r\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAVE FOUR.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS.\r\n\r\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near\r\nhim, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which\r\nthis Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\r\n\r\nIt was shrouded in a deep, black garment, which concealed its head, its\r\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched\r\nhand. But for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure\r\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\r\nsurrounded.\r\n\r\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\r\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no\r\nmore, for the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\r\n\r\n\"I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?\" said\r\nScrooge.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\r\n\r\n\"You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\r\nbut will happen in the time before us,\" Scrooge pursued. \"Is that so,\r\nSpirit?\"\r\n\r\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\r\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\r\nhe received.\r\n\r\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\r\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\r\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\r\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\r\nrecover.\r\n\r\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague\r\nuncertain horror to know that behind the dusky shroud there were\r\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\r\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\r\nheap of black.\r\n\r\n\"Ghost of the Future!\" he exclaimed, \"I fear you more than any specter\r\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\r\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you\r\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?\"\r\n\r\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\r\n\r\n\"Lead on!\" said Scrooge. \"Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\r\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!\"\r\n\r\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\r\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the city, for the city rather seemed to\r\nspring up about them and encompass them of its own act. But there they\r\nwere in the heart of it, on 'Change, amongst the merchants, who hurried\r\nup and down, and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in\r\ngroups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully with\r\ntheir great gold seals, and so forth, as Scrooge had seen them often.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men. Observing\r\nthat the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their\r\ntalk.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, \"I don't know much\r\nabout it, either way. I only know he's dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did he die?\" inquired another.\r\n\r\n\"Last night, I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what was the matter with him?\" asked a third, taking a vast\r\nquantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box. \"I thought he'd never\r\ndie.\"\r\n\r\n\"God knows,\" said the first, with a yawn.\r\n\r\n\"What has he done with his money?\" asked a red-faced gentleman with a\r\npendulous excrescence on the end of his nose, that shook like the gills\r\nof a turkey-cock.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't heard,\" said the man with the large chin, yawning again.\r\n\"Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn't left it to _me_.\r\nThat's all I know.\"\r\n\r\nThis pleasantry was received with a general laugh.\r\n\r\n\"It's likely to be a very cheap funeral,\" said the same speaker; \"for\r\nupon my life I don't know of anybody to go to it. Suppose we make up a\r\nparty and volunteer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind going if a lunch is provided,\" observed the gentleman\r\nwith the excrescence on his nose. \"But I must be fed, if I make one.\"\r\n\r\nAnother laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,\" said the\r\nfirst speaker, \"for I never wear black gloves, and I never eat lunch.\r\nBut I'll offer to go, if anybody else will. When I come to think of it,\r\nI'm not at all sure that I wasn't his most particular friend, for we\r\nused to stop and speak whenever we met. By-by!\"\r\n\r\nSpeakers and listeners strolled away and mixed with other groups.\r\nScrooge knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation.\r\n\r\nThe Phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed to two persons\r\nmeeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation might\r\nlie here.\r\n\r\nHe knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business, very\r\nwealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point always of\r\nstanding well in their esteem, in a business point of view; that is,\r\nstrictly in a business point of view.\r\n\r\n\"How are you?\" said one.\r\n\r\n\"How are you?\" returned the other.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" said the first. \"Old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?\"\r\n\r\n\"So I am told,\" returned the second. \"Cold, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seasonable for Christmas time. You're not a skater, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no. Something else to think of. Good morning!\"\r\n\r\nNot another word. That was their meeting, their conversation, and their\r\nparting.\r\n\r\nScrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should\r\nattach importance to conversations apparently so trivial, but feeling\r\nassured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to\r\nconsider what it was likely to be. They could scarcely be supposed to\r\nhave any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was\r\nPast, and this Ghost's province was the Future. Nor could he think of\r\nany one immediately connected with himself to whom he could apply them.\r\nBut nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some\r\nlatent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every\r\nword he heard and everything he saw, and especially to observe the\r\nshadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation that the\r\nconduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed, and would\r\nrender the solution of these riddles easy.\r\n\r\nHe looked about in that very place for his own image, but another man\r\nstood in his accustomed corner, and though the clock pointed to his\r\nusual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among\r\nthe multitudes that poured in through the porch. It gave him little\r\nsurprise, however, for he had been revolving in his mind a change of\r\nlife, and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out\r\nin this.\r\n\r\nQuiet and dark beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched\r\nhand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied from\r\nthe turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself, that\r\nthe unseen eyes were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder and\r\nfeel very cold.\r\n\r\nThey left the busy scene and went into an obscure part of the town\r\nwhere Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognized its\r\nsituation and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow, the shops\r\nand houses wretched, the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly.\r\nAlleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offenses\r\nof smell, and dirt, and life upon the straggling streets, and the whole\r\nquarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.\r\n\r\nFar in this den of infamous resort there was a low-browed, beetling\r\nshop below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and\r\ngreasy offal, were bought. Upon the floor within were piled up heaps of\r\nrusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse\r\niron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinize were bred\r\nand hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and\r\nsepulchers of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a\r\ncharcoal stove made of old bricks, was a gray-haired rascal, nearly\r\nseventy years of age, who had screened himself from the cold air\r\nwithout by a frowsy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon a\r\nline, and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.\r\n\r\nScrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man just as a\r\nwoman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had scarcely\r\nentered when another woman, similarly laden, came in too, and she was\r\nclosely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by\r\nthe sight of them than they had been upon the recognition of each\r\nother. After a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man\r\nwith the pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Let the charwoman alone to be the first!\" cried she who had entered\r\nfirst. \"Let the laundress alone to be the second, and let the\r\nunder-taker's man alone to be the third. Look here, old Joe, here's a\r\nchance! If we haven't all three met here without meaning it!\"\r\n\r\n\"You couldn't have met in a better place,\" said old Joe, removing his\r\npipe from his mouth. \"Come into the parlor. You were made free of it\r\nlong ago, you know, and the other two an't strangers. Stop till I shut\r\nthe door of the shop. Ah! How it skreeks! There an't such a rusty bit\r\nof metal in the place as its own hinges, I believe, and I'm sure\r\nthere's no such old bones here as mine. Ha, ha! We're all suitable to\r\nour calling, we're well matched. Come into the parlor. Come into the\r\nparlor.\"\r\n\r\nThe parlor was the space behind the screen of rags. The old man raked\r\nthe fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky\r\nlamp (for it was night) with the stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWhile he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on\r\nthe floor and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool, crossing her\r\nelbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two.\r\n\r\n\"What odds then! What odds, Mrs. Dilber?\" said the woman. \"Every person\r\nhas a right to take care of themselves. _He_ always did.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true, indeed!\" said the laundress. \"No man more so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, don't stand staring as if you was afraid, woman; who's the\r\nwiser? We're not going to pick holes in each other's coats, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed!\" said Mrs. Dilber and the man together. \"We should hope\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then!\" cried the woman. \"That's enough. Who's the worse for\r\nthe loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead, a wicked old screw,\"\r\npursued the woman, \"why wasn't he natural in his lifetime? If he had\r\nbeen, he'd have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with\r\ndeath, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone, by himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the truest word that ever was spoke,\" said Mrs. Dilber. \"It's a\r\njudgment on him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish it was a little heavier judgment,\" replied the woman, \"and it\r\nshould have been, you depend upon it, if I could have laid my hands on\r\nanything else. Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of\r\nit. Speak out plain. I'm not afraid to be the first nor afraid for them\r\nto see it. We knew pretty well that we were helping ourselves before we\r\nmet here, I believe. It's no sin. Open the bundle, Joe.\"\r\n\r\nBut the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this, and the man\r\nin faded black, mounting the breach first, produced _his_ plunder.\r\nIt was not extensive. A seal or two, a pencil-case, a pair of\r\nsleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no great value, were all. They were\r\nseverally examined and appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he\r\nwas disposed to give for each upon the wall, and added them up into a\r\ntotal when he found there was nothing more to come.\r\n\r\n\"That's your account,\" said Joe, \"and I wouldn't give another sixpence\r\nif I was to be boiled for not doing it. Who's next?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, two\r\nold-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, a few boots. Her\r\naccount was stated on the wall in the same manner.\r\n\r\n\"I always give too much to ladies. It's a weakness of mine, and that's\r\nthe way I ruin myself,\" said old Joe. \"That's your account. If you\r\nasked me for another penny and made it an open question, I'd repent of\r\nbeing so liberal and knock off half-a-crown.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now undo _my_ bundle, Joe,\" said the first woman.\r\n\r\nJoe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it,\r\nand having unfastened a great many knots, dragged out a large and heavy\r\nroll of some dark stuff.\r\n\r\n\"What do you call this?\" said Joe. \"Bed-curtains!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her crossed\r\narms, \"bed-curtains!\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say you took 'em down, rings an all, with him lying\r\nthere?\" said Joe.\r\n\r\n\"Yes I do,\" replied the woman. \"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"You were born to make your fortune,\" said Joe, \"and you'll certainly\r\ndo it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly sha'n't hold my hand, when I can get anything in it by\r\nreaching it out, for the sake of such a man as he was, I promise you,\r\nJoe,\" returned the woman, coolly. \"Don't drop that oil upon the\r\nblankets, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"His blankets?\" asked Joe.\r\n\r\n\"Whose else's do you think?\" replied the woman. \"He isn't likely to\r\ntake cold without 'em, I dare say.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope he didn't die of anything catching? Eh?\" said old Joe, stopping\r\nin his work and looking up.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you be afraid of that,\" returned the woman. \"I an't so fond of\r\nhis company that I'd loiter about him for such things if he did. Ah!\r\nyou may look through that shirt till your eyes ache, but you won't find\r\na hole in it, nor a threadbare place. It's the best he had, and a fine\r\none, too. They'd have wasted it, if it hadn't been for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you call wasting of it?\" asked old Joe.\r\n\r\n\"Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,\" replied the woman,\r\nwith a laugh. \"Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off\r\nagain. If calico an't good enough for such a purpose, it isn't good\r\nenough for anything. It's quite as unbecoming to the body. He can't\r\nlook uglier than he did in that one.\"\r\n\r\nScrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat grouped about\r\ntheir spoil in the scanty light afforded by the old man's lamp, he\r\nviewed them with a detestation and disgust which could hardly have been\r\ngreater, though they had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha!\" laughed the same woman, when old Joe, producing a flannel bag\r\nwith money in it, told out their several gains upon the ground. \"This\r\nis the end of it, you see! He frightened every one away from him when\r\nhe was alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"Spirit!\" said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. \"I see, I see.\r\nThe case of this unhappy man might be my own. My life tends that way\r\nnow. Merciful heaven, what is this!\"\r\n\r\nHe recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now he almost\r\ntouched a bed--a bare, uncurtained bed--on which, beneath a ragged\r\nsheet there lay a something covered up, which, though it was dumb,\r\nannounced itself in awful language.\r\n\r\nThe room was very dark, too dark to be observed with any accuracy,\r\nthough Scrooge glanced round it, in obedience to a secret impulse,\r\nanxious to know what kind of room it was. A pale light rising in the\r\nouter air, fell straight upon the bed, and on it, plundered and bereft,\r\nunwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.\r\n\r\nScrooge glanced toward the Phantom. Its steady hand was pointed to the\r\nhead. The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising\r\nof it, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge's part, would have disclosed\r\nthe face. He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed\r\nto do it, but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss\r\nthe specter at his side.\r\n\r\nOh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and\r\ndress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command, for this is thy\r\ndominion! But of the loved, revered, and honored head, thou canst not\r\nturn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is\r\nnot that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released, it is not\r\nthat the heart and pulse are still, but that the hand was open,\r\ngenerous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender; and the pulse a\r\nman's. Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds springing from\r\nthe wound, to sow the world with life immortal!\r\n\r\nNo voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and yet he heard\r\nthem when he looked upon the bed. He thought if this man could be\r\nraised up now, what would be his foremost thoughts? Avarice,\r\nhard-dealing, griping cares? They have brought him to a rich end,\r\ntruly!\r\n\r\nHe lay in the dark, empty house with not a man, a woman, or a child to\r\nsay that he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one\r\nkind word I will be kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and\r\nthere was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearthstone. What\r\n_they_ wanted in the room of death, and why they were so restless\r\nand disturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think.\r\n\r\n\"Spirit,\" he said, \"this is a fearful place. In leaving it, I shall not\r\nleave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!\"\r\n\r\nStill the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.\r\n\r\n\"I understand you,\" Scrooge returned, \"and I would do it, if I could.\r\nBut I have not the power, Spirit. I have not the power.\"\r\n\r\nAgain it seemed to look upon him.\r\n\r\n\"If there is any person in the town who feels emotion caused by this\r\nman's death,\" said Scrooge quite agonized, \"show that person to me,\r\nSpirit, I beseech you!\"\r\n\r\nThe Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment like a wing,\r\nand withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight, where a mother and her\r\nchildren were.\r\n\r\nShe was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness, for she walked\r\nup and down the room, started at every sound, looked out from the\r\nwindow, glanced at the clock, tried but in vain to work with her\r\nneedle, and could hardly bear the voices of the children in their play.\r\n\r\nAt length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried to the door\r\nand met her husband, a man whose face was careworn and depressed,\r\nthough he was young. There was a remarkable expression in it now, a\r\nkind of serious delight, of which he felt ashamed and which he\r\nstruggled to repress.\r\n\r\nHe sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire,\r\nand when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a\r\nlong silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.\r\n\r\n\"Is it good,\" she said, \"or bad?\"--to help him.\r\n\r\n\"Bad,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"We are quite ruined?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; there is hope yet, Caroline.\"\r\n\r\n\"If _he_ relents,\" she said, amazed, \"there is! Nothing is past hope,\r\nif such a miracle has happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is past relenting,\" said her husband. \"He is dead.\"\r\n\r\nShe was a mild and patient creature, if her face spoke truth, but she\r\nwas thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so, with clasped\r\nhands. She prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry, but the\r\nfirst was the emotion of her heart.\r\n\r\n\"What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last night said to me\r\nwhen I tried to see him and obtain a week's delay, and what I thought\r\nwas a mere excuse to avoid me, turns out to have been quite true. He\r\nwas not only very ill, but dying then.\"\r\n\r\n\"To whom will our debt be transferred?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. But before that time we shall be ready with the money,\r\nand even though we were not, it would be a bad fortune indeed to find\r\nso merciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep to-night with\r\nlight hearts, Caroline!\"\r\n\r\nYes; soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter. The children's\r\nfaces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little\r\nunderstood, were brighter, and it was a happier house for this man's\r\ndeath! The only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by the\r\nevent, was one of pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,\" said Scrooge; \"or\r\nthat dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now will be forever\r\npresent to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet,\r\nand as they went along, Scrooge looked here and there to find himself,\r\nbut nowhere was he to be seen. They entered poor Bob Cratchit's house,\r\nthe dwelling he had visited before, and found the mother and children\r\nseated round the fire.\r\n\r\nQuiet; very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues\r\nin one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him;\r\nthe mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. But surely they\r\nwere very quiet!\r\n\r\n\"'And He took a child, and set him in the midst of them.'\"\r\n\r\nWhere had Scrooge heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy\r\nmust have read them out, as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold.\r\nWhy did he not go on?\r\n\r\nThe mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"The color hurts my eyes,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe color? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!\r\n\r\n\"They're better now again,\" said Cratchit's wife. \"It makes them weak\r\nby candlelight, and I wouldn't show weak eyes to your father when he\r\ncomes home for the world. It must be near his time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Past it rather,\" Peter answered, shutting up his book. \"But I think he\r\nhas walked a little slower than he used, these few last evenings,\r\nmother.\"\r\n\r\nThey were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a steady, cheerful\r\nvoice, that only faltered once, \"I have known him walk with--I have\r\nknown him walk with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so have I!\" cried Peter; \"often.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so have I!\" exclaimed another. So had all.\r\n\r\n\"But he was very light to carry,\" she resumed, intent upon her work,\r\n\"and his father loved him so that it was no trouble; no trouble. And\r\nthere is your father at the door!\"\r\n\r\nShe hurried out to meet him, and little Bob in his comforter--he had\r\nneed of it, poor fellow--came in. His tea was ready for him on the hob,\r\nand they all tried who should help him to it most. Then the two young\r\nCratchits got up on his knees and laid each child a little cheek\r\nagainst his face, as if they said, \"Don't mind it, father; don't be\r\ngrieved!\"\r\n\r\nBob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the\r\nfamily. He looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry\r\nand speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would be done long\r\nbefore Sunday he said.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?\" said his wife.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear,\" returned Bob. \"I wish you could have gone. It would\r\nhave done you good to see how green a place it is. But you'll see it\r\noften. I promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little,\r\nlittle child!\" cried Bob. \"My little child!\"\r\n\r\nHe broke down all at once. He couldn't help it. If he could have helped\r\nit he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nHe left the room and went upstairs into the room above, which was\r\nlighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas. There was a chair set\r\nloose beside the child and there were signs of some one having been\r\nthere lately. Poor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little\r\nand composed himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to\r\nwhat had happened, and went down again quite happy.\r\n\r\nThey drew about the fire and talked; the girls and mother working\r\nstill. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr. Scrooge's\r\nnephew, whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, meeting him in the\r\nstreet that day, and seeing that he looked a little--\"just a little\r\ndown you know,\" said Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him.\r\n\"On which,\" said Bob, \"for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman you\r\never heard, I told him. 'I am heartily sorry for it, Mr. Cratchit,' he\r\nsaid, 'and heartily sorry for your good wife.' By the by, how he ever\r\nknew _that_, I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Knew what, my dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that you were a good wife,\" replied Bob.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody knows that!\" said Peter.\r\n\r\n\"Very well observed, my boy!\" cried Bob. \"I hope they do. 'Heartily\r\nsorry,' he said, 'for your good wife. If I can be of service to you in\r\nany way,' he said, giving me his card, 'that's where I live. Pray come\r\nto me.' Now, it wasn't,\" cried Bob, \"for the sake of anything he might\r\nbe able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite\r\ndelightful. It really seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim, and felt\r\nwith us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure he's a good soul!\" said Mrs. Cratchit.\r\n\r\n\"You would be surer of it, my dear,\" returned Bob, \"if you saw and\r\nspoke to him. I shouldn't be at all surprised--mark what I say!--if he\r\ngot Peter a better situation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only hear that, Peter,\" said Mrs. Cratchit.\r\n\r\n\"And then,\" cried one of the girls, \"Peter will be keeping company with\r\nsome one, and setting up for himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get along with you!\" retorted Peter, grinning.\r\n\r\n\"It's just likely as not,\" said Bob, \"one of these days; though there's\r\nplenty of time for that, my dear. But, however and whenever we part\r\nfrom one another, I am sure we shall none of us forget poor Tiny\r\nTim--shall we--or this first parting that there was among us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never, father!\" cried they all.\r\n\r\n\"And I know,\" said Bob, \"I know, my dears, that when we recollect how\r\npatient and how mild he was, although he was a little, little child, we\r\nshall not quarrel easily among ourselves and forget poor Tiny Tim in\r\ndoing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, never, father!\" they all cried again.\r\n\r\n\"I am very happy,\" said little Bob; \"I am very happy!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the two young\r\nCratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands. Spirit of Tiny\r\nTim, thy childish essence was from God.\r\n\r\n\"Specter,\" said Scrooge, \"something informs me that our parting moment\r\nis at hand. I know it, but I know not how. Tell me what man that was\r\nwhom we saw lying dead?\"\r\n\r\nThe Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come conveyed him, as before--though at a\r\ndifferent time, he thought, indeed, there seemed no order in these\r\nlatter visions, save that they were in the future--into the resorts of\r\nbusiness men, but showed him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not\r\nstay for anything, but went straight on, as to the end just now\r\ndesired, until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"This court,\" said Scrooge, \"through which we hurry now, is where my\r\nplace of occupation is, and has been for a length of time. I see the\r\nhouse. Let me behold what I shall be in days to come!\"\r\n\r\nThe Spirit stopped, the hand was pointed elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\"The house is yonder,\" Scrooge exclaimed. \"Why do you point away?\"\r\n\r\nThe inexorable finger underwent no change.\r\n\r\nScrooge hastened to the window of his office and looked in. It was an\r\noffice still, but not his. The furniture was not the same, and the\r\nfigure in the chair was not himself. The Phantom pointed as before.\r\n\r\nHe joined it once again, and wondering why and whither he had gone,\r\naccompanied it until they reached an iron gate. He paused to look round\r\nbefore entering.\r\n\r\nA churchyard. Here, then, the wretched man whose name he had now to\r\nlearn lay underneath the ground. It was a worthy place: walled in by\r\nhouses; overrun by grass and weeds, the growth of vegetation's death,\r\nnot life; choked up with too much burying; fat with replete appetite. A\r\nworthy place!\r\n\r\nThe Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to one. He advanced\r\ntowards it, trembling. The Phantom was exactly as it had been, but he\r\ndreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape.\r\n\r\n\"Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,\" said Scrooge,\r\n\"answer me one question. Are these the shadows of the things that will\r\nbe, or are they shadows of things that may be only?\"\r\n\r\nStill the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood.\r\n\r\n\"Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered\r\nin, they must lead,\" said Scrooge; \"but if the course be departed from,\r\nthe ends will change. Say it is thus with what you show me!\"\r\n\r\nThe Spirit was immovable as ever.\r\n\r\nScrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went, and following the\r\nfinger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name,\r\nEBENEZER SCROOGE.\r\n\r\n\"Am _I_ that man who lay upon the bed?\" he cried, upon his knees.\r\n\r\nThe finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.\r\n\r\n\"No, Spirit! Oh, no, no!\"\r\n\r\nThe finger still was there.\r\n\r\n\"Spirit!\" he cried, tight clutching at its robe, \"hear me! I am not the\r\nman I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this\r\nintercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope!\"\r\n\r\nFor the first time the hand appeared to shake.\r\n\r\n\"Good Spirit,\" he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell before it,\r\n\"your nature intercedes for me, and pities me. Assure me that I yet may\r\nchange these shadows you have shown me, by an altered life!\"\r\n\r\nThe kind hand trembled.\r\n\r\n\"I will honor Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I\r\nwill live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all\r\nthree shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they\r\nteach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone!\"\r\n\r\nIn his agony he caught the spectral hand. It sought to free itself, but\r\nhe was strong in his entreaty, and detained it. The Spirit, stronger\r\nyet, repulsed him.\r\n\r\nHolding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed, he saw\r\nan alteration in the Phantom's hood and dress. It shrunk, collapsed,\r\nand dwindled down into a bedpost.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAVE FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHE END OF IT.\r\n\r\nYes, and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own. The room was his\r\nown. Best and happiest of all, the time before him was his own, to make\r\namends in!\r\n\r\n\"I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!\" Scrooge\r\nrepeated, as he scrambled out of bed. \"The spirits of all three shall\r\nstrive within me. Oh, Jacob Marley! Heaven and the Christmas time be\r\npraised for this! I say it on my knees, old Jacob, on my knees!\"\r\n\r\nHe was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions that his\r\nbroken voice would scarcely answer to his call. He had been sobbing\r\nviolently in his conflict with the Spirit, and his face was wet with\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\"They are not torn down,\" cried Scrooge, folding one of his\r\nbed-curtains in his arms, \"they are not torn down, rings and all. They\r\nare here--I am here--the shadows of the things that would have been may\r\nbe dispelled. They will be! I know they will!\"\r\n\r\nHis hands were busy with his garments all this time, turning them\r\ninside out, putting them on upside down, tearing them, mislaying them,\r\nmaking them parties to every kind of extravagance.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what to do!\" cried Scrooge, laughing and crying in the\r\nsame breath, and making a perfect Laoco\u00f6n of himself with his\r\nstockings. \"I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am\r\nas merry as a school-boy. I am as giddy as a drunken man. A Merry\r\nChristmas to everybody! A Happy New Year to all the world. Hallo here!\r\nWhoop! Hallo!\"\r\n\r\nHe had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing there,\r\nperfectly winded.\r\n\r\n\"There's the saucepan that the gruel was in!\" cried Scrooge, starting\r\noff again, and going round the fireplace. \"There's the door by which\r\nthe Ghost of Jacob Marley entered! There's the corner where the Ghost\r\nof Christmas Present sat! There's the window where I saw the wandering\r\nSpirits! It's all right, it's all true, it all happened. Ha, ha, ha!\"\r\n\r\nReally, for a man who had been out of practice for so many years, it\r\nwas a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh. The father of a long,\r\nlong line of brilliant laughs!\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what day of the month it is!\" said Scrooge. \"I don't know\r\nhow long I've been among the spirits. I don't know anything. I'm quite\r\na baby. Never mind. I don't care. I'd rather be a baby. Hallo! Whoop!\r\nHallo here!\"\r\n\r\nHe was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the\r\nlustiest peals he had ever heard. Clash, clang, hammer; ding, dong,\r\nbell. Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang, clash! Oh, glorious, glorious!\r\n\r\nRunning to the window, he opened it and put out his head. No fog, no\r\nmist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold; cold, piping for the blood\r\nto dance to--golden sunlight; heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry\r\nbells. Oh, glorious! Glorious!\r\n\r\n\"What's to-day?\" cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday\r\nclothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.\r\n\r\n\"Eh?\" returned the boy, with all his might of wonder.\r\n\r\n\"What's to-day, my fine fellow?\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"To-day!\" replied the boy. \"Why, Christmas Day.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's Christmas Day!\" said Scrooge to himself. \"I haven't missed it.\r\nThe Spirits have done it all in one night. They can do anything they\r\nlike. Of course they can. Of course they can. Hallo, my fine fellow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!\" returned the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know the poulterer's, in the next street but one, at the\r\ncorner?\" Scrooge inquired.\r\n\r\n\"I should hope I did,\" replied the lad.\r\n\r\n\"An intelligent boy!\" said Scrooge. \"A remarkable boy! Do you know\r\nwhether they've sold the prize turkey that was hanging up there?--not\r\nthe little prize turkey--the big one?\"\r\n\r\n\"What, the one as big as me?\" returned the boy.\r\n\r\n\"What a delightful boy!\" said Scrooge. \"It's a pleasure to talk to him.\r\nYes, my buck!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's hanging there now,\" replied the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Is it?\" said Scrooge. \"Go and buy it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Walk-er!\" exclaimed the boy.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Scrooge, \"I am in earnest. Go and buy it, and tell 'em\r\nto bring it here, that I may give them the direction where to take it.\r\nCome back with the man and I'll give you a shilling. Come back with him\r\nin less than five minutes and I'll give you half-a-crown!\"\r\n\r\nThe boy was off like a shot. He must have had a steady hand at a\r\ntrigger who could have got a shot off half so fast.\r\n\r\n\"I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's!\" whispered Scrooge, rubbing his hands\r\nand splitting with a laugh. \"He sha'n't know who sends it. It's twice\r\nthe size of Tiny Tim. Joe Miller never made such a joke as sending it\r\nto Bob's will be!\"\r\n\r\nThe hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one, but write\r\nit he did, somehow, and went downstairs to open the street door, ready\r\nfor the coming of the poulterer's man. As he stood there waiting his\r\narrival, the knocker caught his eye.\r\n\r\n\"I shall love it as long as I live!\" cried Scrooge, patting it with his\r\nhand. \"I scarcely ever looked at it before. What an honest expression\r\nit has in its face! It's a wonderful knocker! Here's the turkey. Hallo!\r\nWhoop! How are you! Merry Christmas!\"\r\n\r\nIt _was_ a turkey! He never could have stood upon his legs, that bird.\r\nHe would have snapped 'em short off in a minute, like sticks of sealing\r\nwax.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's impossible to carry that to Camden Town,\" said Scrooge. \"You\r\nmust have a cab.\"\r\n\r\nThe chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with which he paid\r\nfor the turkey, and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab, and the\r\nchuckle with which he recompensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by\r\nthe chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and\r\nchuckled till he cried.\r\n\r\nShaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake very\r\nmuch, and shaving requires attention, even when you don't dance while\r\nyou are at it. But if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have\r\nput a piece of sticking-plaster over it, and been quite satisfied.\r\n\r\nHe dressed himself \"all in his best,\" and at last got out into the\r\nstreets. The people were by this time pouring forth, as he had seen\r\nthem with the Ghost of Christmas Present, and walking with his hands\r\nbehind him, Scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile. He\r\nlooked so irresistibly pleasant, in a word, that three or four\r\ngood-humored fellows said, \"Good morning, sir! A merry Christmas to\r\nyou!\" And Scrooge said often afterwards, that of all the blithe sounds\r\nhe had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears.\r\n\r\nHe had not gone far, when coming on towards him he beheld a portly\r\ngentleman who had walked into his counting-house the day before and\r\nsaid, \"Scrooge and Marley's I believe?\" It sent a pang across his heart\r\nto think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met, but\r\nhe knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir,\" said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and taking the old\r\ngentleman by both his hands, \"how do you do? I hope you succeeded\r\nyesterday. It was very kind of you. A merry Christmas to you, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Scrooge?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Scrooge, \"that is my name, and I fear it may not be\r\npleasant to you. Allow me to ask your pardon. And will you have the\r\ngoodness\"--here Scrooge whispered in his ear.\r\n\r\n\"Lord bless me!\" cried the gentleman, as if his breath was taken away.\r\n\"My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you please,\" said Scrooge. \"Not a farthing less. A great many back\r\npayments are included in it, I assure you. Will you do me that favor?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir,\" said the other, shaking hands with him, \"I don't know\r\nwhat to say to such munifi--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say anything, please,\" retorted Scrooge. \"Come and see me. Will\r\nyou come and see me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will!\" cried the old gentleman. And it was clear that he meant to do\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Thank'ee,\" said Scrooge. \"I am much obliged to you. I thank you fifty\r\ntimes. Bless you!\"\r\n\r\nHe went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people\r\nhurrying to and fro, and patted children on the head, and questioned\r\nbeggars, and looked down into the kitchens of houses, and up to the\r\nwindows, and found that everything could yield him pleasure. He had\r\nnever dreamed that any walk--that anything--could give him so much\r\nhappiness. In the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew's\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nHe passed the door a dozen times before he had the courage to go up and\r\nknock; but he made a dash, and did it.\r\n\r\n\"Is your master at home, my dear?\" said Scrooge to the girl. Nice girl!\r\nVery.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he, my love?\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"He's in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I'll show you\r\nupstairs, if you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank'ee. He knows me,\" said Scrooge, with his hand already on the\r\ndining-room lock. \"I'll go in here, my dear.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the door. They were\r\nlooking at the table (which was spread out in great array), for these\r\nyoung housekeepers are always nervous on such points, and like to see\r\nthat everything is right.\r\n\r\n\"Fred!\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\nDear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started! Scrooge had\r\nforgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the corner with the\r\nfootstool, or he wouldn't have done it on any account.\r\n\r\n\"Why, bless my soul!\" cried Fred, \"who's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's I. Your Uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will you let me in,\r\nFred?\"\r\n\r\nLet him in! It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off. He was at home\r\nin five minutes. Nothing could be heartier. His niece looked just the\r\nsame. So did Topper when _he_ came. So did the plump sister when _she_\r\ncame. So did every one when _they_ came. Wonderful party, wonderful\r\ngames, wonderful unanimity, wonderful happiness!\r\n\r\nBut he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was early there. If\r\nhe could only be there first, and catch Bob Cratchit coming late! That\r\nwas the thing he had set his heart upon.\r\n\r\nAnd he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No Bob. A quarter\r\npast. No Bob. He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time.\r\nScrooge sat with his door wide open, that he might see him come into\r\nthe tank.\r\n\r\nHis hat was off before he opened the door; his comforter, too. He was\r\non his stool in a jiffy, driving away with his pen, as if he were\r\ntrying to overtake nine o'clock.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!\" growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice, as near as he could\r\nfeign it. \"What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm very sorry, sir,\" said Bob. \"I _am_ behind my time.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are?\" repeated Scrooge. \"Yes, I think you are. Step this way, sir,\r\nif you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's only once a year, sir,\" pleaded Bob, appearing from the tank. \"It\r\nshall not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,\" said Scrooge, \"I am not going to\r\nstand this sort of thing any longer. And therefore,\" he continued,\r\nleaping from his stool, and giving Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that\r\nhe staggered back into the tank again, \"and therefore I am about to\r\nraise your salary!\"\r\n\r\nBob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He had a momentary\r\nidea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him, and calling to the\r\npeople in the court for help and a straight-waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\"A Merry Christmas, Bob!\" said Scrooge, with an earnestness that could\r\nnot be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. \"A merrier Christmas,\r\nBob, my good fellow, than I have given you for many a year! I'll raise\r\nyour salary, and endeavor to assist your struggling family, and we will\r\ndiscuss your affairs this very afternoon over a Christmas bowl of\r\nsmoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires and buy another coal-scuttle\r\nbefore you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more;\r\nand to Tiny Tim, who did _not_ die, he was a second father. He\r\nbecame as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man as the\r\ngood old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough in the\r\ngood old world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but\r\nhe let them laugh, and little heeded them, for he was wise enough to\r\nknow that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some\r\npeople did not have their fill of laughter in the outset, and knowing\r\nthat such as these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well\r\nthat they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in\r\nless attractive forms. His own heart laughed, and that was quite enough\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\nHe had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the Total\r\nAbstinence Principle ever afterwards, and it was always said of him,\r\nthat he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the\r\nknowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny\r\nTim observed, God bless us, every one!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nLITTLE GRETCHEN AND THE WOODEN SHOE.\r\n\r\nA CHRISTMAS STORY FOR LITTLE CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following story is one of many which has drifted down to us from\r\nthe story-loving nurseries and hearthstones of Germany. I cannot recall\r\nwhen I first had it told to me as a child, varied of course by\r\ndifferent tellers, but always leaving that sweet, tender impression of\r\nGod's loving care for the least of his children. I have since read\r\ndifferent versions of it in at least a half-dozen story books for\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, a long time ago, far away across the great ocean, in\r\na country called Germany, there could be seen a small log hut on the\r\nedge of a great forest, whose fir-trees extended for miles and miles to\r\nthe north. This little house, made of heavy hewn logs, had but one room\r\nin it. A rough pine door gave entrance to this room, and a small square\r\nwindow admitted the light. At the back of the house was built an\r\nold-fashioned stone chimney, out of which in winter usually curled a\r\nthin blue smoke, showing that there was not very much fire within.\r\n\r\nSmall as the house was, it was large enough for the two people who\r\nlived in it. I want to tell you a story to-day about these two people.\r\nOne was an old, gray-haired woman, so old that the little children of\r\nthe village, nearly half a mile away, often wondered whether she had\r\ncome into the world with the huge mountains and the great fir-trees,\r\nwhich stood like giants back of her small hut. Her face was wrinkled\r\nall over with deep lines, which if the children could only have read\r\naright, would have told them of many years of cheerful, happy,\r\nself-sacrifice, of loving, anxious watching beside sick-beds, of quiet\r\nendurance of pain, of many a day of hunger and cold, and of a thousand\r\ndeeds of unselfish love for other people; but, of course, they could\r\nnot read this strange handwriting. They only knew that she was old and\r\nwrinkled, and that she stooped as she walked. None of them seemed to\r\nfear her, for her smile was always cheerful, and she had a kindly word\r\nfor each of them if they chanced to meet her on her way to and from the\r\nvillage. With this old, old woman lived a very little girl. So bright\r\nand happy was she that the travelers who passed by the lonesome little\r\nhouse on the edge of the forest often thought of a sunbeam as they saw\r\nher. These two people were known in the village as Granny Goodyear and\r\nLittle Gretchen.\r\n\r\nThe winter had come and the frost had snapped off many of the smaller\r\nbranches from the pine-trees in the forest. Gretchen and her Granny\r\nwere up by daybreak each morning. After their simple breakfast of\r\noatmeal, Gretchen would run to the little closet and fetch Granny's old\r\nwoolen shawl, which seemed almost as old as Granny herself. Gretchen\r\nalways claimed the right to put the shawl over her Granny's head, even\r\nthough she had to climb onto the wooden bench to do it. After carefully\r\npinning it under Granny's chin, she gave her a good by kiss, and Granny\r\nstarted out for her morning's work in the forest. This work was nothing\r\nmore nor less than the gathering up of the twigs and branches which the\r\nautumn winds and winter frosts had thrown upon the ground. These were\r\ncarefully gathered into a large bundle which Granny tied together with\r\na strong linen band. She then managed to lift the bundle to her\r\nshoulder and trudged off to the village with it. Here she sold the\r\nfagots for kindling wood to the people of the village. Sometimes she\r\nwould get only a few pence each day, and sometimes a dozen or more, but\r\non this money little Gretchen and she managed to live; they had their\r\nhome, and the forest kindly furnished the wood for the fire which kept\r\nthem warm in cold weather.\r\n\r\nIn the summer-time Granny had a little garden at the back of the hut\r\nwhere she raised, with little Gretchen's help, a few potatoes and\r\nturnips and onions. These she carefully stored away for winter use. To\r\nthis meager supply, the pennies, gained by selling the twigs from the\r\nforest, added the oatmeal for Gretchen and a little black coffee for\r\nGranny. Meat was a thing they never thought of having. It cost too much\r\nmoney. Still, Granny and Gretchen were very happy, because they loved\r\neach other dearly. Sometimes Gretchen would be left alone all day long\r\nin the hut because Granny would have some work to do in the village\r\nafter selling her bundle of sticks and twigs. It was during these long\r\ndays that little Gretchen had taught herself to sing the song which the\r\nwind sang to the pine branches. In the summer-time she learned the\r\nchirp and twitter of the birds, until her voice might almost be\r\nmistaken for a bird's voice; she learned to dance as the swaying\r\nshadows did, and even to talk to the stars which shone through the\r\nlittle square window when Granny came home too late or too tired to\r\ntalk.\r\n\r\nSometimes when the weather was fine, or her Granny had an extra bundle\r\nof newly knitted stockings to take to the village, she would let little\r\nGretchen go along with her. It chanced that one of these trips to the\r\ntown came just the week before Christmas, and Gretchen's eyes were\r\ndelighted by the sight of the lovely Christmas trees which stood in the\r\nwindow of the village store. It seemed to her that she would never tire\r\nof looking at the knit dolls, the woolly lambs, the little wooden shops\r\nwith their queer, painted men and women in them, and all the other fine\r\nthings. She had never owned a play-thing in her whole life; therefore,\r\ntoys which you and I would not think much of, seemed to her to be very\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nThat night, after their supper of baked potatoes was over, and little\r\nGretchen had cleared away the dishes and swept up the hearth because\r\nGranny dear was so tired, she brought her own small wooden stool and\r\nplaced it very near Granny's feet and sat down upon it, folding her\r\nhands on her lap. Granny knew that this meant she wanted to talk about\r\nsomething, so she smilingly laid away the large Bible which she had\r\nbeen reading, and took up her knitting, which was as much as to say:\r\n\"Well, Gretchen, dear, Granny is ready to listen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Granny,\" said Gretchen slowly, \"it's almost Christmas time, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dearie,\" said Granny, \"only five more days now,\" and then she\r\nsighed, but little Gretchen was so happy that she did not notice\r\nGranny's sigh.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think, Granny, I'll get this Christmas?\" said she, looking\r\nup eagerly into Granny's face.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, child, child,\" said Granny, shaking her head, \"you'll have no\r\nChristmas this year. We are too poor for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but Granny,\" interrupted little Gretchen, \"think of all the\r\nbeautiful toys we saw in the village to-day. Surely Santa Claus has\r\nsent enough for every little child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, dearie,\" said Granny, \"those toys are for people who can pay money\r\nfor them, and we have no money to spend for Christmas toys.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Granny,\" said Gretchen, \"perhaps some of the little children who\r\nlive in the great house on the hill at the other end of the village\r\nwill be willing to share some of their toys with me. They will be so\r\nglad to give some to a little girl who has none.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear child, dear child,\" said Granny, leaning forward and stroking the\r\nsoft, shiny hair of the little girl, \"your heart is full of love. You\r\nwould be glad to bring a Christmas to every child; but their heads are\r\nso full of what they are going to get that they forget all about\r\nanybody else but themselves.\" Then she sighed and shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Granny,\" said Gretchen, her bright, happy tone of voice growing\r\na little less joyous, \"perhaps the dear Santa Claus will show some of\r\nthe village children how to make presents that do not cost money, and\r\nsome of them may surprise me Christmas morning with a present. And,\r\nGranny, dear,\" added she, springing up from her low stool, \"can't I\r\ngather some of the pine branches and take them to the old sick man who\r\nlives in the house by the mill, so that he can have the sweet smell of\r\nour pine forest in his room all Christmas day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dearie,\" said Granny, \"you may do what you can to make the\r\nChristmas bright and happy, but you must not expect any present\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but Granny,\" said little Gretchen, her face brightening, \"you\r\nforget all about the shining Christmas angels, who came down to earth\r\nand sang their wonderful song the night the beautiful Christ Child was\r\nborn! They are so loving and good that _they_ will not forget any\r\nlittle child. I shall ask my dear stars to-night to tell them of us.\r\nYou know,\" she added, with a look of relief, \"the stars are so very\r\nhigh that they must know the angels quite well, as they come and go\r\nwith their messages from the loving God.\"\r\n\r\nGranny sighed, as she half whispered, \"Poor child, poor child!\" but\r\nGretchen threw her arm around Granny's neck and gave her a hearty kiss,\r\nsaying as she did so: \"Oh, Granny, Granny, you don't talk to the stars\r\noften enough, else you wouldn't be sad at Christmas time.\" Then she\r\ndanced all around the room, whirling her little skirts about her to\r\nshow Granny how the wind had made the snow dance that day. She looked\r\nso droll and funny that Granny forgot her cares and worries and laughed\r\nwith little Gretchen over her new snow-dance. The days passed on, and\r\nthe morning before Christmas Eve came. Gretchen having tidied up the\r\nlittle room--for Granny had taught her to be a careful housewife--was\r\noff to the forest, singing a bird-like song, almost as happy and free\r\nas the birds themselves. She was very busy that day, preparing a\r\nsurprise for Granny. First, however, she gathered the most beautiful of\r\nthe fir branches within her reach to take the next morning to the old\r\nsick man who lived by the mill.\r\n\r\nThe day was all too short for the happy little girl. When Granny came\r\ntrudging wearily home that night, she found the frame of the doorway\r\ncovered with green pine branches.\r\n\r\n\"It's to welcome you, Granny! It's to welcome you!\" cried Gretchen;\r\n\"our dear old home wanted to give you a Christmas welcome. Don't you\r\nsee, the branches of evergreen make it look as if it were smiling all\r\nover, and it is trying to say, 'A happy Christmas' to you, Granny!\"\r\n\r\nGranny laughed and kissed the little girl, as they opened the door and\r\nwent in together. Here was a new surprise for Granny. The four posts of\r\nthe wooden bed, which stood in one corner of the room, had been trimmed\r\nby the busy little fingers with smaller and more flexible branches of\r\nthe pine-trees. A small bouquet of red mountain-ash berries stood at\r\neach side of the fireplace, and these, together with the trimmed posts\r\nof the bed, gave the plain old room quite a festival look. Gretchen\r\nlaughed and clapped her hands and danced about until the house seemed\r\nfull of music to poor, tired Granny, whose heart had been sad as she\r\nturned towards their home that night, thinking of the disappointment\r\nwhich must come to loving little Gretchen the next morning.\r\n\r\nAfter supper was over little Gretchen drew her stool up to Granny's\r\nside, and laying her soft, little hands on Granny's knee, asked to be\r\ntold once again the story of the coming of the Christ Child; how the\r\nnight that he was born the beautiful angels had sung their wonderful\r\nsong, and how the whole sky had become bright with a strange and\r\nglorious light, never seen by the people of earth before. Gretchen had\r\nheard the story many, many times before, but she never grew tired of\r\nit, and now that Christmas Eve had come again, the happy little child\r\nwanted to hear it once more.\r\n\r\nWhen Granny had finished telling it the two sat quiet and silent for a\r\nlittle while thinking it over; then Granny rose and said that it was\r\ntime for them to go to bed. She slowly took off her heavy wooden shoes,\r\nsuch as are worn in that country, and placed them beside the hearth.\r\nGretchen looked thoughtfully at them for a minute or two, and then she\r\nsaid, \"Granny, don't you think that _somebody_ in all this wide world\r\nwill think of us to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, Gretchen,\" said Granny, \"I don't think any one will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, Granny,\" said Gretchen, \"the Christmas angels will, I\r\nknow; so I am going to take one of your wooden shoes, and put it on the\r\nwindow sill outside, so that they may see it as they pass by. I am sure\r\nthe stars will tell the Christmas angels where the shoe is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you foolish, foolish child,\" said Granny; \"you are only getting\r\nready for a disappointment. To-morrow morning there will be nothing\r\nwhatever in the shoe. I can tell you that now.\"\r\n\r\nBut little Gretchen would not listen. She only shook her head and cried\r\nout: \"Ah, Granny, you don't talk enough to the stars.\" With this she\r\nseized the shoe, and opening the door, hurried out to place it on the\r\nwindow-sill. It was very dark without, and something soft and cold\r\nseemed to gently kiss her hair and face. Gretchen knew by this that it\r\nwas snowing, and she looked up to the sky, anxious to see if the stars\r\nwere in sight, but a strong wind was tumbling the dark, heavy\r\nsnow-clouds about and had shut away all else.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said Gretchen softly to herself, \"the stars are up there,\r\neven if I can't see them, and the Christmas angels do not mind\r\nsnow-storms.\"\r\n\r\nJust then a rough wind went sweeping by the little girl, whispering\r\nsomething to her which she could not understand, and then it made a\r\nsudden rush up to the snow-clouds and parted them, so that the deep,\r\nmysterious sky appeared beyond, and shining down out of the midst of it\r\nwas Gretchen's favorite star.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, little star, little star!\" said the child, laughing aloud, \"I knew\r\nyou were there, though I couldn't see you. Will you whisper to the\r\nChristmas angels as they come by, that little Gretchen wants so very\r\nmuch to have a Christmas gift to-morrow morning if they have one to\r\nspare, and that she has put one of Granny's shoes upon the window-sill\r\nready for it?\"\r\n\r\nA moment more and the little girl, standing on tiptoe, had reached the\r\nwindow-sill and placed the shoe upon it, and was back in the house\r\nagain beside Granny and the warm fire. The two went quietly to bed, and\r\nthat night as little Gretchen knelt to pray to the Heavenly Father, she\r\nthanked him for having sent the Christ Child into the world to teach\r\nall mankind how to be loving and unselfish, and in a few moments she\r\nwas quietly sleeping, dreaming of the Christmas angels.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, very early, even before the sun was up, little\r\nGretchen was awakened by the sound of sweet music coming from the\r\nvillage. She listened for a moment and then she knew that the\r\nchoir-boys were singing the Christmas carols in the open air of the\r\nvillage street. She sprang out of bed and began to dress herself as\r\nquickly as possible, singing as she dressed. While Granny was slowly\r\nputting on her clothes, little Gretchen, having finished dressing\r\nherself, unfastened the door and hurried out to see what the Christmas\r\nangels had left in the old wooden shoe.\r\n\r\nThe white snow covered everything--trees, stumps, roads, and\r\npastures--until the whole world looked like fairyland. Gretchen climbed\r\nup on a large stone which was beneath the window and carefully lifted\r\ndown the wooden shoe. The snow tumbled off of it in a shower over the\r\nlittle girl's hands, but she did not heed that; she ran hurriedly back\r\ninto the house, putting her hand into the toe of the shoe as she ran.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Granny! Oh, Granny!\" she exclaimed, \"you didn't believe the\r\nChristmas angels would think about us, but see, they have, they have!\r\nHere is a dear little bird nestled down in the toe of your shoe! Oh,\r\nisn't he beautiful!\"\r\n\r\nGranny came forward and looked at what the child was holding lovingly\r\nin her hand. There she saw a tiny chick-a-dee, whose wing was evidently\r\nbroken by the rough and boisterous winds of the night before, and who\r\nhad taken shelter in the safe, dry toe of the old wooden shoe. She\r\ngently took the little bird out of Gretchen's hands, and skilfully\r\nbound his broken wing to his side, so that he need not hurt himself by\r\ntrying to fly with it. Then she showed Gretchen how to make a nice warm\r\nnest for the little stranger, close beside the fire, and when their\r\nbreakfast was ready she let Gretchen feed the little bird with a few\r\nmoist crumbs.\r\n\r\nLater in the day Gretchen carried the fresh, green boughs to the old\r\nsick man by the mill, and on her way home stopped to see and enjoy the\r\nChristmas toys of some other children whom she knew, never once wishing\r\nthat they were hers. When she reached home she found that the little\r\nbird had gone to sleep. Soon, however, he opened his eyes and stretched\r\nhis head up, saying just as plain as a bird could say, \"Now, my new\r\nfriends, I want you to give me something more to eat.\" Gretchen gladly\r\nfed him again, and then holding him in her lap, she softly and gently\r\nstroked his gray feathers until the little creature seemed to lose all\r\nfear of her. That evening Granny taught her a Christmas hymn and told\r\nher another beautiful Christmas story. Then Gretchen made up a funny\r\nlittle story to tell to the birdie. He winked his eyes and turned his\r\nhead from side to side in such a droll fashion that Gretchen laughed\r\nuntil the tears came.\r\n\r\nAs Granny and she got ready for bed that night, Gretchen put her arms\r\nsoftly around Granny's neck, and whispered: \"What a beautiful Christmas\r\nwe have had to-day, Granny! Is there anything in the world more lovely\r\nthan Christmas?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, child, nay,\" said Granny, \"not to such loving hearts as yours.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE LEGEND OF THE CHRIST CHILD.[3]\r\n\r\nA STORY FOR CHRISTMAS EVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to tell you to-night a story which has been told to little\r\nchildren in Germany for many hundreds of years.\r\n\r\n          [3] Adapted from the German.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, a long, long time ago, on the night before Christmas,\r\na little child was wandering all alone through the streets of a great\r\ncity. There were many people on the street, fathers and mothers,\r\nsisters and brothers, uncles and aunts, and even gray-haired\r\ngrandfathers and grandmothers, all of whom were hurrying home with\r\nbundles of presents for each other and for their little ones. Fine\r\ncarriages rolled by, express wagons rattled past, even old carts were\r\npressed into service, and all things seemed in a hurry, and glad with\r\nexpectation of the coming Christmas morning.\r\n\r\nFrom some of the windows bright lights were already beginning to stream\r\nuntil it was almost as bright as day. But the little child seemed to\r\nhave no home, and wandered about listlessly from street to street. No\r\none took any notice of him, except perhaps Jack Frost, who bit his bare\r\ntoes and made the ends of his fingers tingle. The north wind, too,\r\nseemed to notice the child, for it blew against him and pierced his\r\nragged garments through and through, causing him to shiver with cold.\r\nHome after home he passed, looking with longing eyes through the\r\nwindows, in upon the glad, happy children, most of whom were helping to\r\ntrim the Christmas trees for the coming morrow.\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" said the child to himself, \"where there is so much gladness\r\nand happiness, some of it may be for me.\" So with timid steps he\r\napproached a large and handsome house. Through the windows he could see\r\na tall and stately Christmas tree already lighted. Many presents hung\r\nupon it. Its green boughs were trimmed with gold and silver ornaments.\r\nSlowly he climbed up the broad steps and gently rapped at the door. It\r\nwas opened by a large man-servant. He had a kindly face, although his\r\nvoice was deep and gruff. He looked at the little child for a moment,\r\nthen sadly shook his head and said, \"Go down off the steps. There is no\r\nroom here for such as you.\" He looked sorry as he spoke; possibly he\r\nremembered his own little ones at home, and was glad that they were not\r\nout in this cold and bitter night. Through the open door a bright light\r\nshone, and the warm air, filled with the fragrance of the Christmas\r\npine, rushed out from the inner room and greeted the little wanderer\r\nwith a kiss. As the child turned back into the cold and darkness, he\r\nwondered why the footman had spoken thus, for surely, thought he, those\r\nlittle children would love to have another companion join them in their\r\njoyous Christmas festival. But the little children inside did not even\r\nknow that he had knocked at the door.\r\n\r\nThe street grew colder and darker as the child passed on. He went sadly\r\nforward, saying to himself, \"Is there no one in all this great city who\r\nwill share the Christmas with me?\" Farther and farther down the street\r\nhe wandered, to where the homes were not so large and beautiful. There\r\nseemed to be little children inside of nearly all the houses. They were\r\ndancing and frolicking about. Christmas trees could be seen in nearly\r\nevery window, with beautiful dolls and trumpets and picture-books and\r\nballs and tops and other dainty toys hung upon them. In one window the\r\nchild noticed a little lamb made of soft, white wool. Around its neck\r\nwas tied a red ribbon. It had evidently been hung on the tree for one\r\nof the children. The little stranger stopped before this window and\r\nlooked long and earnestly at the beautiful things inside, but most of\r\nall was he drawn toward the white lamb. At last, creeping up to the\r\nwindow-pane, he gently tapped upon it. A little girl came to the window\r\nand looked out into the dark street where the snow had now begun to\r\nfall. She saw the child, but she only frowned and shook her head and\r\nsaid, \"Go away and come some other time. We are too busy to take care\r\nof you now.\" Back into the dark, cold street he turned again. The wind\r\nwas whirling past him and seemed to say, \"Hurry on, hurry on, we have\r\nno time to stop. 'Tis Christmas Eve and everybody is in a hurry\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\nAgain and again the little child rapped softly at door or window-pane.\r\nAt each place he was refused admission. One mother feared he might have\r\nsome ugly disease which her darlings would catch; another father said\r\nhe had only enough for his own children, and none to spare for beggar\r\nbrats. Still another told him to go home where he belonged, and not to\r\ntrouble other folks.\r\n\r\nThe hours passed; later grew the night, and colder blew the wind, and\r\ndarker seemed the street. Farther and farther the little one wandered.\r\nThere was scarcely any one left upon the street by this time, and the\r\nfew who remained did not seem to see the child, when suddenly ahead of\r\nhim, there appeared a bright, single ray of light. It shone through the\r\ndarkness into the child's eyes. He looked up smilingly, and said, \"I\r\nwill go where the small light beckons, perhaps they will share their\r\nChristmas with me.\"\r\n\r\nHurrying past all the other houses he soon reached the end of the\r\nstreet and went straight up to the window from which the light was\r\nstreaming. It was a poor, little, low house, but the child cared not\r\nfor that. The light seemed still to call him in. From what do you\r\nsuppose the light came? Nothing but a tallow candle which had been\r\nplaced in an old cup with a broken handle, in the window, as a glad\r\ntoken of Christmas Eve. There was neither curtain nor shade to the\r\nsmall, square window, and as the little child looked in he saw standing\r\nupon a neat, wooden table a branch of a Christmas tree. The room was\r\nplainly furnished, but it was very clean. Near the fireplace sat a\r\nlovely faced mother with a little two-year-old on her knee and an older\r\nchild beside her. The two children were looking into their mother's\r\nface and listening to a story. She must have been telling them a\r\nChristmas story, I think. A few bright coals were burning in the\r\nfireplace, and all seemed light and warm within.\r\n\r\nThe little wanderer crept closer and closer to the window-pane. So\r\nsweet was the mother's face, so loving seemed the little children, that\r\nat last he took courage and tapped gently, very gently, on the door.\r\nThe mother stopped talking, the little children looked up. \"What was\r\nthat, mother?\" asked the little girl at her side. \"I think it was some\r\none tapping on the door,\" replied the mother. \"Run as quickly as you\r\ncan and open it, dear, for it is a bitter cold night to keep any one\r\nwaiting in this storm.\" \"Oh, mother, I think it was the bough of the\r\ntree tapping against the window-pane,\" said the little girl. \"Do please\r\ngo on with our story.\" Again the little wanderer tapped upon the door.\r\n\"My child! my child,\" exclaimed the mother, rising, \"that certainly was\r\na rap on the door. Run quickly and open it. No one must be left out in\r\nthe cold on our beautiful Christmas Eve.\"\r\n\r\nThe child ran to the door and threw it wide open. The mother saw the\r\nragged stranger standing without, cold and shivering, with bare head\r\nand almost bare feet. She held out both hands and drew him into the\r\nwarm, bright room. \"You poor dear child,\" was all she said, and putting\r\nher arms around him, she drew him close to her breast. \"He is very\r\ncold, my children,\" she exclaimed. \"We must warm him.\" \"And,\" added the\r\nlittle girl, \"we must love him and give him some of our Christmas,\r\ntoo.\" \"Yes,\" said the mother, \"but first let us warm him.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother sat down beside the fire with the child on her lap, and her\r\nown two little ones warmed his half-frozen hands in theirs. The mother\r\nsmoothed his tangled curls, and bending low over his head, kissed the\r\nchild's face. She gathered the three little ones in her arms and the\r\ncandle and the fire light shone over them. For a moment the room was\r\nvery still. By and by the little girl said, softly, to her mother, \"May\r\nwe not light the Christmas tree, and let him see how beautiful it\r\nlooks?\" \"Yes,\" said the mother. With that she seated the child on a low\r\nstool beside the fire, and went herself to fetch the few simple\r\nornaments which from year to year she had saved for her children's\r\nChristmas tree. They were soon so busy that they did not notice the\r\nroom had filled with a strange and brilliant light. They turned and\r\nlooked at the spot where the little wanderer sat. His ragged clothes\r\nhad changed to garments white and beautiful; his tangled curls seemed\r\nlike a halo of golden light about his head; but most glorious of all\r\nwas his face, which shone with a light so dazzling that they could\r\nscarcely look upon it.\r\n\r\nIn silent wonder they gazed at the child. Their little room seemed to\r\ngrow larger and larger until it was as wide as the whole world, the\r\nroof of their low house seemed to expand and rise, until it reached to\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nWith a sweet and gentle smile the wonderful child looked upon them for\r\na moment, and then slowly rose and floated through the air, above the\r\ntreetops, beyond the church spire, higher even than the clouds\r\nthemselves, until he appeared to them to be a shining star in the sky\r\nabove. At last he disappeared from sight. The astonished children\r\nturned in hushed awe to their mother, and said, in a whisper, \"Oh,\r\nmother, it was the Christ Child, was it not?\" And the mother answered\r\nin a low tone, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it is said, dear children, that each Christmas Eve the little\r\nChrist Child wanders through some town or village, and those who\r\nreceive him and take him into their homes and hearts have given to them\r\nthis marvelous vision which is denied to others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nA CHRISTMAS SONG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following anonymous poem so exquisitely expresses the true\r\nChristmas thanksgiving and joy that we give it with this collection of\r\nChristmas thoughts, regretting that we are not able to give the name of\r\nthe author also.\r\n\r\n    \"There is a song so thrilling,\r\n    So far all songs excelling,\r\n      That he who sings it sings it oft again;\r\n    No mortal did invent it,\r\n    But God by angels sent it,\r\n      So deep and earnest yet so sweet and plain.\r\n\r\n    \"The love that it revealeth\r\n    All earthly sorrows healeth,\r\n      They flee like mist before the break of day;\r\n    When, oh, my soul, thou learnest\r\n    This song of songs in earnest\r\n      Thy cares and sorrows all shall flee away.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nBIRTH AND CHILDHOOD OF JESUS.\r\n\r\nTHE SHEPHERDS AND THE ANGELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass there went out a decree from C\u00e6sar Augustus, that\r\nall the world should be enrolled. And all went to enroll themselves,\r\nevery one to his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of\r\nthe city of Nazareth, into Jud\u00e6a, to the city of David, which is called\r\nBethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David; to enroll\r\nhimself with Mary. And it came to pass, while they were there she\r\nbrought forth her firstborn son; and she wrapped him in\r\nswaddling-clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room\r\nfor them in the inn.\r\n\r\nAnd there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the field, and\r\nkeeping watch by night over their flock. And an angel of the Lord stood\r\nby them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they\r\nwere sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Be not afraid; for\r\nbehold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the\r\npeople: for there is born to you this day in the city of David a\r\nSaviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this is the sign unto you; ye\r\nshall find a babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes, and lying in a manger.\r\nAnd suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host\r\npraising God, and saying:\r\n\r\n    Glory to God in the highest,\r\n    And on earth peace\r\n    Among men in whom he is well pleased.\r\n\r\nAnd it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into heaven,\r\nthe shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem,\r\nand see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known\r\nunto us. And they came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and\r\nthe babe lying in the manger. And when they saw it, they made known\r\nconcerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child. And\r\nall that heard it wondered at the things which were spoken unto them by\r\nthe shepherds. But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her\r\nheart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all\r\nthe things that they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken unto\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnd when eight days were fulfilled his name was called\r\n\r\n    JESUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WISE MEN FROM THE EAST.\r\n\r\nNow when Jesus was born, behold, Wise Men from the east came to\r\nJerusalem, saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we\r\nsaw his star in the east, and are come to worship him. And when Herod\r\nthe king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And\r\ngathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he\r\ninquired of them where the Christ should be born. And they said unto\r\nhim, In Bethlehem of Jud\u00e6a: for thus it is written by the prophet:\r\n_And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah, are in no wise least among the\r\nprinces of Judah: for out of thee shall come forth a governor, which\r\nshall be shepherd of my people Israel._ Then Herod privily called\r\nthe Wise Men, and learned of them carefully what time the star\r\nappeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search out\r\ncarefully concerning the young child; and when ye have found him, bring\r\nme word, that I also may come and worship him. And they, having heard\r\nthe king, went their way; and lo, the star, which they saw in the east,\r\nwent before them, till it came and stood over where the young child\r\nwas. And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great\r\njoy. And they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary his\r\nmother; and they fell down and worshiped him; and opening their\r\ntreasures they offered unto him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.\r\nAnd being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to\r\nHerod, they departed into their own country another way.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PRINTED BY R.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n",
    "\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscribed from the 1894 Chapman and Hall \"Christmas Stories\" edition by\r\nDavid Price, email ccx074@coventry.ac.uk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCTOR MARIGOLD\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a Cheap Jack, and my own father's name was Willum Marigold.  It was\r\nin his lifetime supposed by some that his name was William, but my own\r\nfather always consistently said, No, it was Willum.  On which point I\r\ncontent myself with looking at the argument this way: If a man is not\r\nallowed to know his own name in a free country, how much is he allowed to\r\nknow in a land of slavery?  As to looking at the argument through the\r\nmedium of the Register, Willum Marigold come into the world before\r\nRegisters come up much,--and went out of it too.  They wouldn't have been\r\ngreatly in his line neither, if they had chanced to come up before him.\r\n\r\nI was born on the Queen's highway, but it was the King's at that time.  A\r\ndoctor was fetched to my own mother by my own father, when it took place\r\non a common; and in consequence of his being a very kind gentleman, and\r\naccepting no fee but a tea-tray, I was named Doctor, out of gratitude and\r\ncompliment to him.  There you have me.  Doctor Marigold.\r\n\r\nI am at present a middle-aged man of a broadish build, in cords,\r\nleggings, and a sleeved waistcoat the strings of which is always gone\r\nbehind.  Repair them how you will, they go like fiddle-strings.  You have\r\nbeen to the theatre, and you have seen one of the wiolin-players screw up\r\nhis wiolin, after listening to it as if it had been whispering the secret\r\nto him that it feared it was out of order, and then you have heard it\r\nsnap.  That's as exactly similar to my waistcoat as a waistcoat and a\r\nwiolin can be like one another.\r\n\r\nI am partial to a white hat, and I like a shawl round my neck wore loose\r\nand easy.  Sitting down is my favourite posture.  If I have a taste in\r\npoint of personal jewelry, it is mother-of-pearl buttons.  There you have\r\nme again, as large as life.\r\n\r\nThe doctor having accepted a tea-tray, you'll guess that my father was a\r\nCheap Jack before me.  You are right.  He was.  It was a pretty tray.  It\r\nrepresented a large lady going along a serpentining up-hill gravel-walk,\r\nto attend a little church.  Two swans had likewise come astray with the\r\nsame intentions.  When I call her a large lady, I don't mean in point of\r\nbreadth, for there she fell below my views, but she more than made it up\r\nin heighth; her heighth and slimness was--in short THE heighth of both.\r\n\r\nI often saw that tray, after I was the innocently smiling cause (or more\r\nlikely screeching one) of the doctor's standing it up on a table against\r\nthe wall in his consulting-room.  Whenever my own father and mother were\r\nin that part of the country, I used to put my head (I have heard my own\r\nmother say it was flaxen curls at that time, though you wouldn't know an\r\nold hearth-broom from it now till you come to the handle, and found it\r\nwasn't me) in at the doctor's door, and the doctor was always glad to see\r\nme, and said, \"Aha, my brother practitioner!  Come in, little M.D.  How\r\nare your inclinations as to sixpence?\"\r\n\r\nYou can't go on for ever, you'll find, nor yet could my father nor yet my\r\nmother.  If you don't go off as a whole when you are about due, you're\r\nliable to go off in part, and two to one your head's the part.  Gradually\r\nmy father went off his, and my mother went off hers.  It was in a\r\nharmless way, but it put out the family where I boarded them.  The old\r\ncouple, though retired, got to be wholly and solely devoted to the Cheap\r\nJack business, and were always selling the family off.  Whenever the\r\ncloth was laid for dinner, my father began rattling the plates and\r\ndishes, as we do in our line when we put up crockery for a bid, only he\r\nhad lost the trick of it, and mostly let 'em drop and broke 'em.  As the\r\nold lady had been used to sit in the cart, and hand the articles out one\r\nby one to the old gentleman on the footboard to sell, just in the same\r\nway she handed him every item of the family's property, and they disposed\r\nof it in their own imaginations from morning to night.  At last the old\r\ngentleman, lying bedridden in the same room with the old lady, cries out\r\nin the old patter, fluent, after having been silent for two days and\r\nnights: \"Now here, my jolly companions every one,--which the Nightingale\r\nclub in a village was held, At the sign of the Cabbage and Shears, Where\r\nthe singers no doubt would have greatly excelled, But for want of taste,\r\nvoices and ears,--now, here, my jolly companions, every one, is a working\r\nmodel of a used-up old Cheap Jack, without a tooth in his head, and with\r\na pain in every bone: so like life that it would be just as good if it\r\nwasn't better, just as bad if it wasn't worse, and just as new if it\r\nwasn't worn out.  Bid for the working model of the old Cheap Jack, who\r\nhas drunk more gunpowder-tea with the ladies in his time than would blow\r\nthe lid off a washerwoman's copper, and carry it as many thousands of\r\nmiles higher than the moon as naught nix naught, divided by the national\r\ndebt, carry nothing to the poor-rates, three under, and two over.  Now,\r\nmy hearts of oak and men of straw, what do you say for the lot?  Two\r\nshillings, a shilling, tenpence, eightpence, sixpence, fourpence.\r\nTwopence?  Who said twopence?  The gentleman in the scarecrow's hat?  I\r\nam ashamed of the gentleman in the scarecrow's hat.  I really am ashamed\r\nof him for his want of public spirit.  Now I'll tell you what I'll do\r\nwith you.  Come!  I'll throw you in a working model of a old woman that\r\nwas married to the old Cheap Jack so long ago that upon my word and\r\nhonour it took place in Noah's Ark, before the Unicorn could get in to\r\nforbid the banns by blowing a tune upon his horn.  There now!  Come!  What\r\ndo you say for both?  I'll tell you what I'll do with you.  I don't bear\r\nyou malice for being so backward.  Here!  If you make me a bid that'll\r\nonly reflect a little credit on your town, I'll throw you in a warming-\r\npan for nothing, and lend you a toasting-fork for life.  Now come; what\r\ndo you say after that splendid offer?  Say two pound, say thirty\r\nshillings, say a pound, say ten shillings, say five, say two and six.  You\r\ndon't say even two and six?  You say two and three?  No.  You shan't have\r\nthe lot for two and three.  I'd sooner give it to you, if you was good-\r\nlooking enough.  Here!  Missis!  Chuck the old man and woman into the\r\ncart, put the horse to, and drive 'em away and bury 'em!\"  Such were the\r\nlast words of Willum Marigold, my own father, and they were carried out,\r\nby him and by his wife, my own mother, on one and the same day, as I\r\nought to know, having followed as mourner.\r\n\r\nMy father had been a lovely one in his time at the Cheap Jack work, as\r\nhis dying observations went to prove.  But I top him.  I don't say it\r\nbecause it's myself, but because it has been universally acknowledged by\r\nall that has had the means of comparison.  I have worked at it.  I have\r\nmeasured myself against other public speakers,--Members of Parliament,\r\nPlatforms, Pulpits, Counsel learned in the law,--and where I have found\r\n'em good, I have took a bit of imagination from 'em, and where I have\r\nfound 'em bad, I have let 'em alone.  Now I'll tell you what.  I mean to\r\ngo down into my grave declaring that of all the callings ill used in\r\nGreat Britain, the Cheap Jack calling is the worst used.  Why ain't we a\r\nprofession?  Why ain't we endowed with privileges?  Why are we forced to\r\ntake out a hawker's license, when no such thing is expected of the\r\npolitical hawkers?  Where's the difference betwixt us?  Except that we\r\nare Cheap Jacks and they are Dear Jacks, _I_ don't see any difference but\r\nwhat's in our favour.\r\n\r\nFor look here!  Say it's election time.  I am on the footboard of my cart\r\nin the market-place, on a Saturday night.  I put up a general\r\nmiscellaneous lot.  I say: \"Now here, my free and independent woters, I'm\r\na going to give you such a chance as you never had in all your born days,\r\nnor yet the days preceding.  Now I'll show you what I am a going to do\r\nwith you.  Here's a pair of razors that'll shave you closer than the\r\nBoard of Guardians; here's a flat-iron worth its weight in gold; here's a\r\nfrying-pan artificially flavoured with essence of beefsteaks to that\r\ndegree that you've only got for the rest of your lives to fry bread and\r\ndripping in it and there you are replete with animal food; here's a\r\ngenuine chronometer watch in such a solid silver case that you may knock\r\nat the door with it when you come home late from a social meeting, and\r\nrouse your wife and family, and save up your knocker for the postman; and\r\nhere's half-a-dozen dinner plates that you may play the cymbals with to\r\ncharm baby when it's fractious.  Stop!  I'll throw in another article,\r\nand I'll give you that, and it's a rolling-pin; and if the baby can only\r\nget it well into its mouth when its teeth is coming and rub the gums once\r\nwith it, they'll come through double, in a fit of laughter equal to being\r\ntickled.  Stop again!  I'll throw you in another article, because I don't\r\nlike the looks of you, for you haven't the appearance of buyers unless I\r\nlose by you, and because I'd rather lose than not take money to-night,\r\nand that's a looking-glass in which you may see how ugly you look when\r\nyou don't bid.  What do you say now?  Come!  Do you say a pound?  Not\r\nyou, for you haven't got it.  Do you say ten shillings?  Not you, for you\r\nowe more to the tallyman.  Well then, I'll tell you what I'll do with\r\nyou.  I'll heap 'em all on the footboard of the cart,--there they are!\r\nrazors, flat watch, dinner plates, rolling-pin, and away for four\r\nshillings, and I'll give you sixpence for your trouble!\"  This is me, the\r\nCheap Jack.  But on the Monday morning, in the same market-place, comes\r\nthe Dear Jack on the hustings--_his_ cart--and, what does _he_ say?  \"Now\r\nmy free and independent woters, I am a going to give you such a chance\"\r\n(he begins just like me) \"as you never had in all your born days, and\r\nthat's the chance of sending Myself to Parliament.  Now I'll tell you\r\nwhat I am a going to do for you.  Here's the interests of this\r\nmagnificent town promoted above all the rest of the civilised and\r\nuncivilised earth.  Here's your railways carried, and your neighbours'\r\nrailways jockeyed.  Here's all your sons in the Post-office.  Here's\r\nBritannia smiling on you.  Here's the eyes of Europe on you.  Here's\r\nuniwersal prosperity for you, repletion of animal food, golden\r\ncornfields, gladsome homesteads, and rounds of applause from your own\r\nhearts, all in one lot, and that's myself.  Will you take me as I stand?\r\nYou won't?  Well, then, I'll tell you what I'll do with you.  Come now!\r\nI'll throw you in anything you ask for.  There!  Church-rates, abolition\r\nof more malt tax, no malt tax, universal education to the highest mark,\r\nor uniwersal ignorance to the lowest, total abolition of flogging in the\r\narmy or a dozen for every private once a month all round, Wrongs of Men\r\nor Rights of Women--only say which it shall be, take 'em or leave 'em,\r\nand I'm of your opinion altogether, and the lot's your own on your own\r\nterms.  There!  You won't take it yet!  Well, then, I'll tell you what\r\nI'll do with you.  Come!  You _are_ such free and independent woters, and\r\nI am so proud of you,--you _are_ such a noble and enlightened\r\nconstituency, and I _am_ so ambitious of the honour and dignity of being\r\nyour member, which is by far the highest level to which the wings of the\r\nhuman mind can soar,--that I'll tell you what I'll do with you.  I'll\r\nthrow you in all the public-houses in your magnificent town for nothing.\r\nWill that content you?  It won't?  You won't take the lot yet?  Well,\r\nthen, before I put the horse in and drive away, and make the offer to the\r\nnext most magnificent town that can be discovered, I'll tell you what\r\nI'll do.  Take the lot, and I'll drop two thousand pound in the streets\r\nof your magnificent town for them to pick up that can.  Not enough?  Now\r\nlook here.  This is the very furthest that I'm a going to.  I'll make it\r\ntwo thousand five hundred.  And still you won't?  Here, missis!  Put the\r\nhorse--no, stop half a moment, I shouldn't like to turn my back upon you\r\nneither for a trifle, I'll make it two thousand seven hundred and fifty\r\npound.  There!  Take the lot on your own terms, and I'll count out two\r\nthousand seven hundred and fifty pound on the footboard of the cart, to\r\nbe dropped in the streets of your magnificent town for them to pick up\r\nthat can.  What do you say?  Come now!  You won't do better, and you may\r\ndo worse.  You take it?  Hooray!  Sold again, and got the seat!\"\r\n\r\nThese Dear Jacks soap the people shameful, but we Cheap Jacks don't.  We\r\ntell 'em the truth about themselves to their faces, and scorn to court\r\n'em.  As to wenturesomeness in the way of puffing up the lots, the Dear\r\nJacks beat us hollow.  It is considered in the Cheap Jack calling, that\r\nbetter patter can be made out of a gun than any article we put up from\r\nthe cart, except a pair of spectacles.  I often hold forth about a gun\r\nfor a quarter of an hour, and feel as if I need never leave off.  But\r\nwhen I tell 'em what the gun can do, and what the gun has brought down, I\r\nnever go half so far as the Dear Jacks do when they make speeches in\r\npraise of _their_ guns--their great guns that set 'em on to do it.\r\nBesides, I'm in business for myself: I ain't sent down into the market-\r\nplace to order, as they are.  Besides, again, my guns don't know what I\r\nsay in their laudation, and their guns do, and the whole concern of 'em\r\nhave reason to be sick and ashamed all round.  These are some of my\r\narguments for declaring that the Cheap Jack calling is treated ill in\r\nGreat Britain, and for turning warm when I think of the other Jacks in\r\nquestion setting themselves up to pretend to look down upon it.\r\n\r\nI courted my wife from the footboard of the cart.  I did indeed.  She was\r\na Suffolk young woman, and it was in Ipswich market-place right opposite\r\nthe corn-chandler's shop.  I had noticed her up at a window last Saturday\r\nthat was, appreciating highly.  I had took to her, and I had said to\r\nmyself, \"If not already disposed of, I'll have that lot.\"  Next Saturday\r\nthat come, I pitched the cart on the same pitch, and I was in very high\r\nfeather indeed, keeping 'em laughing the whole of the time, and getting\r\noff the goods briskly.  At last I took out of my waistcoat-pocket a small\r\nlot wrapped in soft paper, and I put it this way (looking up at the\r\nwindow where she was).  \"Now here, my blooming English maidens, is an\r\narticle, the last article of the present evening's sale, which I offer to\r\nonly you, the lovely Suffolk Dumplings biling over with beauty, and I\r\nwon't take a bid of a thousand pounds for from any man alive.  Now what\r\nis it?  Why, I'll tell you what it is.  It's made of fine gold, and it's\r\nnot broke, though there's a hole in the middle of it, and it's stronger\r\nthan any fetter that ever was forged, though it's smaller than any finger\r\nin my set of ten.  Why ten?  Because, when my parents made over my\r\nproperty to me, I tell you true, there was twelve sheets, twelve towels,\r\ntwelve table-cloths, twelve knives, twelve forks, twelve tablespoons, and\r\ntwelve teaspoons, but my set of fingers was two short of a dozen, and\r\ncould never since be matched.  Now what else is it?  Come, I'll tell you.\r\nIt's a hoop of solid gold, wrapped in a silver curl-paper, that I myself\r\ntook off the shining locks of the ever beautiful old lady in Threadneedle\r\nStreet, London city; I wouldn't tell you so if I hadn't the paper to\r\nshow, or you mightn't believe it even of me.  Now what else is it?  It's\r\na man-trap and a handcuff, the parish stocks and a leg-lock, all in gold\r\nand all in one.  Now what else is it?  It's a wedding-ring.  Now I'll\r\ntell you what I'm a going to do with it.  I'm not a going to offer this\r\nlot for money; but I mean to give it to the next of you beauties that\r\nlaughs, and I'll pay her a visit to-morrow morning at exactly half after\r\nnine o'clock as the chimes go, and I'll take her out for a walk to put up\r\nthe banns.\"  She laughed, and got the ring handed up to her.  When I\r\ncalled in the morning, she says, \"O dear!  It's never you, and you never\r\nmean it?\"  \"It's ever me,\" says I, \"and I am ever yours, and I ever mean\r\nit.\"  So we got married, after being put up three times--which, by the\r\nbye, is quite in the Cheap Jack way again, and shows once more how the\r\nCheap Jack customs pervade society.\r\n\r\nShe wasn't a bad wife, but she had a temper.  If she could have parted\r\nwith that one article at a sacrifice, I wouldn't have swopped her away in\r\nexchange for any other woman in England.  Not that I ever did swop her\r\naway, for we lived together till she died, and that was thirteen year.\r\nNow, my lords and ladies and gentlefolks all, I'll let you into a secret,\r\nthough you won't believe it.  Thirteen year of temper in a Palace would\r\ntry the worst of you, but thirteen year of temper in a Cart would try the\r\nbest of you.  You are kept so very close to it in a cart, you see.\r\nThere's thousands of couples among you getting on like sweet ile upon a\r\nwhetstone in houses five and six pairs of stairs high, that would go to\r\nthe Divorce Court in a cart.  Whether the jolting makes it worse, I don't\r\nundertake to decide; but in a cart it does come home to you, and stick to\r\nyou.  Wiolence in a cart is _so_ wiolent, and aggrawation in a cart is\r\n_so_ aggrawating.\r\n\r\nWe might have had such a pleasant life!  A roomy cart, with the large\r\ngoods hung outside, and the bed slung underneath it when on the road, an\r\niron pot and a kettle, a fireplace for the cold weather, a chimney for\r\nthe smoke, a hanging-shelf and a cupboard, a dog and a horse.  What more\r\ndo you want?  You draw off upon a bit of turf in a green lane or by the\r\nroadside, you hobble your old horse and turn him grazing, you light your\r\nfire upon the ashes of the last visitors, you cook your stew, and you\r\nwouldn't call the Emperor of France your father.  But have a temper in\r\nthe cart, flinging language and the hardest goods in stock at you, and\r\nwhere are you then?  Put a name to your feelings.\r\n\r\nMy dog knew as well when she was on the turn as I did.  Before she broke\r\nout, he would give a howl, and bolt.  How he knew it, was a mystery to\r\nme; but the sure and certain knowledge of it would wake him up out of his\r\nsoundest sleep, and he would give a howl, and bolt.  At such times I\r\nwished I was him.\r\n\r\nThe worst of it was, we had a daughter born to us, and I love children\r\nwith all my heart.  When she was in her furies she beat the child.  This\r\ngot to be so shocking, as the child got to be four or five year old, that\r\nI have many a time gone on with my whip over my shoulder, at the old\r\nhorse's head, sobbing and crying worse than ever little Sophy did.  For\r\nhow could I prevent it?  Such a thing is not to be tried with such a\r\ntemper--in a cart--without coming to a fight.  It's in the natural size\r\nand formation of a cart to bring it to a fight.  And then the poor child\r\ngot worse terrified than before, as well as worse hurt generally, and her\r\nmother made complaints to the next people we lighted on, and the word\r\nwent round, \"Here's a wretch of a Cheap Jack been a beating his wife.\"\r\n\r\nLittle Sophy was such a brave child!  She grew to be quite devoted to her\r\npoor father, though he could do so little to help her.  She had a\r\nwonderful quantity of shining dark hair, all curling natural about her.\r\nIt is quite astonishing to me now, that I didn't go tearing mad when I\r\nused to see her run from her mother before the cart, and her mother catch\r\nher by this hair, and pull her down by it, and beat her.\r\n\r\nSuch a brave child I said she was!  Ah! with reason.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you mind next time, father dear,\" she would whisper to me, with\r\nher little face still flushed, and her bright eyes still wet; \"if I don't\r\ncry out, you may know I am not much hurt.  And even if I do cry out, it\r\nwill only be to get mother to let go and leave off.\"  What I have seen\r\nthe little spirit bear--for me--without crying out!\r\n\r\nYet in other respects her mother took great care of her.  Her clothes\r\nwere always clean and neat, and her mother was never tired of working at\r\n'em.  Such is the inconsistency in things.  Our being down in the marsh\r\ncountry in unhealthy weather, I consider the cause of Sophy's taking bad\r\nlow fever; but however she took it, once she got it she turned away from\r\nher mother for evermore, and nothing would persuade her to be touched by\r\nher mother's hand.  She would shiver and say, \"No, no, no,\" when it was\r\noffered at, and would hide her face on my shoulder, and hold me tighter\r\nround the neck.\r\n\r\nThe Cheap Jack business had been worse than ever I had known it, what\r\nwith one thing and what with another (and not least with railroads, which\r\nwill cut it all to pieces, I expect, at last), and I was run dry of\r\nmoney.  For which reason, one night at that period of little Sophy's\r\nbeing so bad, either we must have come to a dead-lock for victuals and\r\ndrink, or I must have pitched the cart as I did.\r\n\r\nI couldn't get the dear child to lie down or leave go of me, and indeed I\r\nhadn't the heart to try, so I stepped out on the footboard with her\r\nholding round my neck.  They all set up a laugh when they see us, and one\r\nchuckle-headed Joskin (that I hated for it) made the bidding, \"Tuppence\r\nfor her!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, you country boobies,\" says I, feeling as if my heart was a heavy\r\nweight at the end of a broken sashline, \"I give you notice that I am a\r\ngoing to charm the money out of your pockets, and to give you so much\r\nmore than your money's worth that you'll only persuade yourselves to draw\r\nyour Saturday night's wages ever again arterwards by the hopes of meeting\r\nme to lay 'em out with, which you never will, and why not?  Because I've\r\nmade my fortunes by selling my goods on a large scale for seventy-five\r\nper cent. less than I give for 'em, and I am consequently to be elevated\r\nto the House of Peers next week, by the title of the Duke of Cheap and\r\nMarkis Jackaloorul.  Now let's know what you want to-night, and you shall\r\nhave it.  But first of all, shall I tell you why I have got this little\r\ngirl round my neck?  You don't want to know?  Then you shall.  She\r\nbelongs to the Fairies.  She's a fortune-teller.  She can tell me all\r\nabout you in a whisper, and can put me up to whether you're going to buy\r\na lot or leave it.  Now do you want a saw?  No, she says you don't,\r\nbecause you're too clumsy to use one.  Else here's a saw which would be a\r\nlifelong blessing to a handy man, at four shillings, at three and six, at\r\nthree, at two and six, at two, at eighteen-pence.  But none of you shall\r\nhave it at any price, on account of your well-known awkwardness, which\r\nwould make it manslaughter.  The same objection applies to this set of\r\nthree planes which I won't let you have neither, so don't bid for 'em.\r\nNow I am a going to ask her what you do want.\"  (Then I whispered, \"Your\r\nhead burns so, that I am afraid it hurts you bad, my pet,\" and she\r\nanswered, without opening her heavy eyes, \"Just a little, father.\")  \"O!\r\nThis little fortune-teller says it's a memorandum-book you want.  Then\r\nwhy didn't you mention it?  Here it is.  Look at it.  Two hundred\r\nsuperfine hot-pressed wire-wove pages--if you don't believe me, count\r\n'em--ready ruled for your expenses, an everlastingly pointed pencil to\r\nput 'em down with, a double-bladed penknife to scratch 'em out with, a\r\nbook of printed tables to calculate your income with, and a camp-stool to\r\nsit down upon while you give your mind to it!  Stop!  And an umbrella to\r\nkeep the moon off when you give your mind to it on a pitch-dark night.\r\nNow I won't ask you how much for the lot, but how little?  How little are\r\nyou thinking of?  Don't be ashamed to mention it, because my\r\nfortune-teller knows already.\"  (Then making believe to whisper, I kissed\r\nher,--and she kissed me.)  \"Why, she says you are thinking of as little\r\nas three and threepence!  I couldn't have believed it, even of you,\r\nunless she told me.  Three and threepence!  And a set of printed tables\r\nin the lot that'll calculate your income up to forty thousand a year!\r\nWith an income of forty thousand a year, you grudge three and sixpence.\r\nWell then, I'll tell you my opinion.  I so despise the threepence, that\r\nI'd sooner take three shillings.  There.  For three shillings, three\r\nshillings, three shillings!  Gone.  Hand 'em over to the lucky man.\"\r\n\r\nAs there had been no bid at all, everybody looked about and grinned at\r\neverybody, while I touched little Sophy's face and asked her if she felt\r\nfaint, or giddy.  \"Not very, father.  It will soon be over.\"  Then\r\nturning from the pretty patient eyes, which were opened now, and seeing\r\nnothing but grins across my lighted grease-pot, I went on again in my\r\nCheap Jack style.  \"Where's the butcher?\"  (My sorrowful eye had just\r\ncaught sight of a fat young butcher on the outside of the crowd.)  \"She\r\nsays the good luck is the butcher's.  Where is he?\"  Everybody handed on\r\nthe blushing butcher to the front, and there was a roar, and the butcher\r\nfelt himself obliged to put his hand in his pocket, and take the lot.  The\r\nparty so picked out, in general, does feel obliged to take the lot--good\r\nfour times out of six.  Then we had another lot, the counterpart of that\r\none, and sold it sixpence cheaper, which is always wery much enjoyed.\r\nThen we had the spectacles.  It ain't a special profitable lot, but I put\r\n'em on, and I see what the Chancellor of the Exchequer is going to take\r\noff the taxes, and I see what the sweetheart of the young woman in the\r\nshawl is doing at home, and I see what the Bishops has got for dinner,\r\nand a deal more that seldom fails to fetch 'em 'up in their spirits; and\r\nthe better their spirits, the better their bids.  Then we had the ladies'\r\nlot--the teapot, tea-caddy, glass sugar-basin, half-a-dozen spoons, and\r\ncaudle-cup--and all the time I was making similar excuses to give a look\r\nor two and say a word or two to my poor child.  It was while the second\r\nladies' lot was holding 'em enchained that I felt her lift herself a\r\nlittle on my shoulder, to look across the dark street.  \"What troubles\r\nyou, darling?\"  \"Nothing troubles me, father.  I am not at all troubled.\r\nBut don't I see a pretty churchyard over there?\"  \"Yes, my dear.\"  \"Kiss\r\nme twice, dear father, and lay me down to rest upon that churchyard grass\r\nso soft and green.\"  I staggered back into the cart with her head dropped\r\non my shoulder, and I says to her mother, \"Quick.  Shut the door!  Don't\r\nlet those laughing people see!\"  \"What's the matter?\" she cries.  \"O\r\nwoman, woman,\" I tells her, \"you'll never catch my little Sophy by her\r\nhair again, for she has flown away from you!\"\r\n\r\nMaybe those were harder words than I meant 'em; but from that time forth\r\nmy wife took to brooding, and would sit in the cart or walk beside it,\r\nhours at a stretch, with her arms crossed, and her eyes looking on the\r\nground.  When her furies took her (which was rather seldomer than before)\r\nthey took her in a new way, and she banged herself about to that extent\r\nthat I was forced to hold her.  She got none the better for a little\r\ndrink now and then, and through some years I used to wonder, as I plodded\r\nalong at the old horse's head, whether there was many carts upon the road\r\nthat held so much dreariness as mine, for all my being looked up to as\r\nthe King of the Cheap Jacks.  So sad our lives went on till one summer\r\nevening, when, as we were coming into Exeter, out of the farther West of\r\nEngland, we saw a woman beating a child in a cruel manner, who screamed,\r\n\"Don't beat me!  O mother, mother, mother!\"  Then my wife stopped her\r\nears, and ran away like a wild thing, and next day she was found in the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nMe and my dog were all the company left in the cart now; and the dog\r\nlearned to give a short bark when they wouldn't bid, and to give another\r\nand a nod of his head when I asked him, \"Who said half a crown?  Are you\r\nthe gentleman, sir, that offered half a crown?\"  He attained to an\r\nimmense height of popularity, and I shall always believe taught himself\r\nentirely out of his own head to growl at any person in the crowd that bid\r\nas low as sixpence.  But he got to be well on in years, and one night\r\nwhen I was conwulsing York with the spectacles, he took a conwulsion on\r\nhis own account upon the very footboard by me, and it finished him.\r\n\r\nBeing naturally of a tender turn, I had dreadful lonely feelings on me\r\narter this.  I conquered 'em at selling times, having a reputation to\r\nkeep (not to mention keeping myself), but they got me down in private,\r\nand rolled upon me.  That's often the way with us public characters.  See\r\nus on the footboard, and you'd give pretty well anything you possess to\r\nbe us.  See us off the footboard, and you'd add a trifle to be off your\r\nbargain.  It was under those circumstances that I come acquainted with a\r\ngiant.  I might have been too high to fall into conversation with him,\r\nhad it not been for my lonely feelings.  For the general rule is, going\r\nround the country, to draw the line at dressing up.  When a man can't\r\ntrust his getting a living to his undisguised abilities, you consider him\r\nbelow your sort.  And this giant when on view figured as a Roman.\r\n\r\nHe was a languid young man, which I attribute to the distance betwixt his\r\nextremities.  He had a little head and less in it, he had weak eyes and\r\nweak knees, and altogether you couldn't look at him without feeling that\r\nthere was greatly too much of him both for his joints and his mind.  But\r\nhe was an amiable though timid young man (his mother let him out, and\r\nspent the money), and we come acquainted when he was walking to ease the\r\nhorse betwixt two fairs.  He was called Rinaldo di Velasco, his name\r\nbeing Pickleson.\r\n\r\nThis giant, otherwise Pickleson, mentioned to me under the seal of\r\nconfidence that, beyond his being a burden to himself, his life was made\r\na burden to him by the cruelty of his master towards a step-daughter who\r\nwas deaf and dumb.  Her mother was dead, and she had no living soul to\r\ntake her part, and was used most hard.  She travelled with his master's\r\ncaravan only because there was nowhere to leave her, and this giant,\r\notherwise Pickleson, did go so far as to believe that his master often\r\ntried to lose her.  He was such a very languid young man, that I don't\r\nknow how long it didn't take him to get this story out, but it passed\r\nthrough his defective circulation to his top extremity in course of time.\r\n\r\nWhen I heard this account from the giant, otherwise Pickleson, and\r\nlikewise that the poor girl had beautiful long dark hair, and was often\r\npulled down by it and beaten, I couldn't see the giant through what stood\r\nin my eyes.  Having wiped 'em, I give him sixpence (for he was kept as\r\nshort as he was long), and he laid it out in two three-penn'orths of gin-\r\nand-water, which so brisked him up, that he sang the Favourite Comic of\r\nShivery Shakey, ain't it cold?--a popular effect which his master had\r\ntried every other means to get out of him as a Roman wholly in vain.\r\n\r\nHis master's name was Mim, a wery hoarse man, and I knew him to speak to.\r\nI went to that Fair as a mere civilian, leaving the cart outside the\r\ntown, and I looked about the back of the Vans while the performing was\r\ngoing on, and at last, sitting dozing against a muddy cart-wheel, I come\r\nupon the poor girl who was deaf and dumb.  At the first look I might\r\nalmost have judged that she had escaped from the Wild Beast Show; but at\r\nthe second I thought better of her, and thought that if she was more\r\ncared for and more kindly used she would be like my child.  She was just\r\nthe same age that my own daughter would have been, if her pretty head had\r\nnot fell down upon my shoulder that unfortunate night.\r\n\r\nTo cut it short, I spoke confidential to Mim while he was beating the\r\ngong outside betwixt two lots of Pickleson's publics, and I put it to\r\nhim, \"She lies heavy on your own hands; what'll you take for her?\"  Mim\r\nwas a most ferocious swearer.  Suppressing that part of his reply which\r\nwas much the longest part, his reply was, \"A pair of braces.\"  \"Now I'll\r\ntell you,\" says I, \"what I'm a going to do with you.  I'm a going to\r\nfetch you half-a-dozen pair of the primest braces in the cart, and then\r\nto take her away with me.\"  Says Mim (again ferocious), \"I'll believe it\r\nwhen I've got the goods, and no sooner.\"  I made all the haste I could,\r\nlest he should think twice of it, and the bargain was completed, which\r\nPickleson he was thereby so relieved in his mind that he come out at his\r\nlittle back door, longways like a serpent, and give us Shivery Shakey in\r\na whisper among the wheels at parting.\r\n\r\nIt was happy days for both of us when Sophy and me began to travel in the\r\ncart.  I at once give her the name of Sophy, to put her ever towards me\r\nin the attitude of my own daughter.  We soon made out to begin to\r\nunderstand one another, through the goodness of the Heavens, when she\r\nknowed that I meant true and kind by her.  In a very little time she was\r\nwonderful fond of me.  You have no idea what it is to have anybody\r\nwonderful fond of you, unless you have been got down and rolled upon by\r\nthe lonely feelings that I have mentioned as having once got the better\r\nof me.\r\n\r\nYou'd have laughed--or the rewerse--it's according to your disposition--if\r\nyou could have seen me trying to teach Sophy.  At first I was\r\nhelped--you'd never guess by what--milestones.  I got some large\r\nalphabets in a box, all the letters separate on bits of bone, and saying\r\nwe was going to WINDSOR, I give her those letters in that order, and then\r\nat every milestone I showed her those same letters in that same order\r\nagain, and pointed towards the abode of royalty.  Another time I give her\r\nCART, and then chalked the same upon the cart.  Another time I give her\r\nDOCTOR MARIGOLD, and hung a corresponding inscription outside my\r\nwaistcoat.  People that met us might stare a bit and laugh, but what did\r\n_I_ care, if she caught the idea?  She caught it after long patience and\r\ntrouble, and then we did begin to get on swimmingly, I believe you!  At\r\nfirst she was a little given to consider me the cart, and the cart the\r\nabode of royalty, but that soon wore off.\r\n\r\nWe had our signs, too, and they was hundreds in number.  Sometimes she\r\nwould sit looking at me and considering hard how to communicate with me\r\nabout something fresh,--how to ask me what she wanted explained,--and\r\nthen she was (or I thought she was; what does it signify?) so like my\r\nchild with those years added to her, that I half-believed it was herself,\r\ntrying to tell me where she had been to up in the skies, and what she had\r\nseen since that unhappy night when she flied away.  She had a pretty\r\nface, and now that there was no one to drag at her bright dark hair, and\r\nit was all in order, there was a something touching in her looks that\r\nmade the cart most peaceful and most quiet, though not at all melancholy.\r\n[N.B.  In the Cheap Jack patter, we generally sound it lemonjolly, and it\r\ngets a laugh.]\r\n\r\nThe way she learnt to understand any look of mine was truly surprising.\r\nWhen I sold of a night, she would sit in the cart unseen by them outside,\r\nand would give a eager look into my eyes when I looked in, and would hand\r\nme straight the precise article or articles I wanted.  And then she would\r\nclap her hands, and laugh for joy.  And as for me, seeing her so bright,\r\nand remembering what she was when I first lighted on her, starved and\r\nbeaten and ragged, leaning asleep against the muddy cart-wheel, it give\r\nme such heart that I gained a greater heighth of reputation than ever,\r\nand I put Pickleson down (by the name of Mim's Travelling Giant otherwise\r\nPickleson) for a fypunnote in my will.\r\n\r\nThis happiness went on in the cart till she was sixteen year old.  By\r\nwhich time I began to feel not satisfied that I had done my whole duty by\r\nher, and to consider that she ought to have better teaching than I could\r\ngive her.  It drew a many tears on both sides when I commenced explaining\r\nmy views to her; but what's right is right, and you can't neither by\r\ntears nor laughter do away with its character.\r\n\r\nSo I took her hand in mine, and I went with her one day to the Deaf and\r\nDumb Establishment in London, and when the gentleman come to speak to us,\r\nI says to him: \"Now I'll tell you what I'll do with you, sir.  I am\r\nnothing but a Cheap Jack, but of late years I have laid by for a rainy\r\nday notwithstanding.  This is my only daughter (adopted), and you can't\r\nproduce a deafer nor a dumber.  Teach her the most that can be taught her\r\nin the shortest separation that can be named,--state the figure for\r\nit,--and I am game to put the money down.  I won't bate you a single\r\nfarthing, sir, but I'll put down the money here and now, and I'll\r\nthankfully throw you in a pound to take it.  There!\"  The gentleman\r\nsmiled, and then, \"Well, well,\" says he, \"I must first know what she has\r\nlearned already.  How do you communicate with her?\"  Then I showed him,\r\nand she wrote in printed writing many names of things and so forth; and\r\nwe held some sprightly conversation, Sophy and me, about a little story\r\nin a book which the gentleman showed her, and which she was able to read.\r\n\"This is most extraordinary,\" says the gentleman; \"is it possible that\r\nyou have been her only teacher?\"  \"I have been her only teacher, sir,\" I\r\nsays, \"besides herself.\"  \"Then,\" says the gentleman, and more acceptable\r\nwords was never spoke to me, \"you're a clever fellow, and a good fellow.\"\r\nThis he makes known to Sophy, who kisses his hands, claps her own, and\r\nlaughs and cries upon it.\r\n\r\nWe saw the gentleman four times in all, and when he took down my name and\r\nasked how in the world it ever chanced to be Doctor, it come out that he\r\nwas own nephew by the sister's side, if you'll believe me, to the very\r\nDoctor that I was called after.  This made our footing still easier, and\r\nhe says to me:\r\n\r\n\"Now, Marigold, tell me what more do you want your adopted daughter to\r\nknow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want her, sir, to be cut off from the world as little as can be,\r\nconsidering her deprivations, and therefore to be able to read whatever\r\nis wrote with perfect ease and pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"My good fellow,\" urges the gentleman, opening his eyes wide, \"why _I_\r\ncan't do that myself!\"\r\n\r\nI took his joke, and gave him a laugh (knowing by experience how flat you\r\nfall without it), and I mended my words accordingly.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean to do with her afterwards?\" asks the gentleman, with a\r\nsort of a doubtful eye.  \"To take her about the country?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the cart, sir, but only in the cart.  She will live a private life,\r\nyou understand, in the cart.  I should never think of bringing her\r\ninfirmities before the public.  I wouldn't make a show of her for any\r\nmoney.\"\r\n\r\nThe gentleman nodded, and seemed to approve.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" says he, \"can you part with her for two years?\"\r\n\r\n\"To do her that good,--yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's another question,\" says the gentleman, looking towards her,--\"can\r\nshe part with you for two years?\"\r\n\r\nI don't know that it was a harder matter of itself (for the other was\r\nhard enough to me), but it was harder to get over.  However, she was\r\npacified to it at last, and the separation betwixt us was settled.  How\r\nit cut up both of us when it took place, and when I left her at the door\r\nin the dark of an evening, I don't tell.  But I know this; remembering\r\nthat night, I shall never pass that same establishment without a\r\nheartache and a swelling in the throat; and I couldn't put you up the\r\nbest of lots in sight of it with my usual spirit,--no, not even the gun,\r\nnor the pair of spectacles,--for five hundred pound reward from the\r\nSecretary of State for the Home Department, and throw in the honour of\r\nputting my legs under his mahogany arterwards.\r\n\r\nStill, the loneliness that followed in the cart was not the old\r\nloneliness, because there was a term put to it, however long to look\r\nforward to; and because I could think, when I was anyways down, that she\r\nbelonged to me and I belonged to her.  Always planning for her coming\r\nback, I bought in a few months' time another cart, and what do you think\r\nI planned to do with it?  I'll tell you.  I planned to fit it up with\r\nshelves and books for her reading, and to have a seat in it where I could\r\nsit and see her read, and think that I had been her first teacher.  Not\r\nhurrying over the job, I had the fittings knocked together in contriving\r\nways under my own inspection, and here was her bed in a berth with\r\ncurtains, and there was her reading-table, and here was her writing-desk,\r\nand elsewhere was her books in rows upon rows, picters and no picters,\r\nbindings and no bindings, gilt-edged and plain, just as I could pick 'em\r\nup for her in lots up and down the country, North and South and West and\r\nEast, Winds liked best and winds liked least, Here and there and gone\r\nastray, Over the hills and far away.  And when I had got together pretty\r\nwell as many books as the cart would neatly hold, a new scheme come into\r\nmy head, which, as it turned out, kept my time and attention a good deal\r\nemployed, and helped me over the two years' stile.\r\n\r\nWithout being of an awaricious temper, I like to be the owner of things.\r\nI shouldn't wish, for instance, to go partners with yourself in the Cheap\r\nJack cart.  It's not that I mistrust you, but that I'd rather know it was\r\nmine.  Similarly, very likely you'd rather know it was yours.  Well!  A\r\nkind of a jealousy began to creep into my mind when I reflected that all\r\nthose books would have been read by other people long before they was\r\nread by her.  It seemed to take away from her being the owner of 'em\r\nlike.  In this way, the question got into my head: Couldn't I have a book\r\nnew-made express for her, which she should be the first to read?\r\n\r\nIt pleased me, that thought did; and as I never was a man to let a\r\nthought sleep (you must wake up all the whole family of thoughts you've\r\ngot and burn their nightcaps, or you won't do in the Cheap Jack line), I\r\nset to work at it.  Considering that I was in the habit of changing so\r\nmuch about the country, and that I should have to find out a literary\r\ncharacter here to make a deal with, and another literary character there\r\nto make a deal with, as opportunities presented, I hit on the plan that\r\nthis same book should be a general miscellaneous lot,--like the razors,\r\nflat-iron, chronometer watch, dinner plates, rolling-pin, and looking-\r\nglass,--and shouldn't be offered as a single indiwidual article, like the\r\nspectacles or the gun.  When I had come to that conclusion, I come to\r\nanother, which shall likewise be yours.\r\n\r\nOften had I regretted that she never had heard me on the footboard, and\r\nthat she never could hear me.  It ain't that _I_ am vain, but that _you_\r\ndon't like to put your own light under a bushel.  What's the worth of\r\nyour reputation, if you can't convey the reason for it to the person you\r\nmost wish to value it?  Now I'll put it to you.  Is it worth sixpence,\r\nfippence, fourpence, threepence, twopence, a penny, a halfpenny, a\r\nfarthing?  No, it ain't.  Not worth a farthing.  Very well, then.  My\r\nconclusion was that I would begin her book with some account of myself.\r\nSo that, through reading a specimen or two of me on the footboard, she\r\nmight form an idea of my merits there.  I was aware that I couldn't do\r\nmyself justice.  A man can't write his eye (at least _I_ don't know how\r\nto), nor yet can a man write his voice, nor the rate of his talk, nor the\r\nquickness of his action, nor his general spicy way.  But he can write his\r\nturns of speech, when he is a public speaker,--and indeed I have heard\r\nthat he very often does, before he speaks 'em.\r\n\r\nWell!  Having formed that resolution, then come the question of a name.\r\nHow did I hammer that hot iron into shape?  This way.  The most difficult\r\nexplanation I had ever had with her was, how I come to be called Doctor,\r\nand yet was no Doctor.  After all, I felt that I had failed of getting it\r\ncorrectly into her mind, with my utmost pains.  But trusting to her\r\nimprovement in the two years, I thought that I might trust to her\r\nunderstanding it when she should come to read it as put down by my own\r\nhand.  Then I thought I would try a joke with her and watch how it took,\r\nby which of itself I might fully judge of her understanding it.  We had\r\nfirst discovered the mistake we had dropped into, through her having\r\nasked me to prescribe for her when she had supposed me to be a Doctor in\r\na medical point of view; so thinks I, \"Now, if I give this book the name\r\nof my Prescriptions, and if she catches the idea that my only\r\nPrescriptions are for her amusement and interest,--to make her laugh in a\r\npleasant way, or to make her cry in a pleasant way,--it will be a\r\ndelightful proof to both of us that we have got over our difficulty.\"  It\r\nfell out to absolute perfection.  For when she saw the book, as I had it\r\ngot up,--the printed and pressed book,--lying on her desk in her cart,\r\nand saw the title, DOCTOR MARIGOLD'S PRESCRIPTIONS, she looked at me for\r\na moment with astonishment, then fluttered the leaves, then broke out a\r\nlaughing in the charmingest way, then felt her pulse and shook her head,\r\nthen turned the pages pretending to read them most attentive, then kissed\r\nthe book to me, and put it to her bosom with both her hands.  I never was\r\nbetter pleased in all my life!\r\n\r\nBut let me not anticipate.  (I take that expression out of a lot of\r\nromances I bought for her.  I never opened a single one of 'em--and I\r\nhave opened many--but I found the romancer saying \"let me not\r\nanticipate.\"  Which being so, I wonder why he did anticipate, or who\r\nasked him to it.)  Let me not, I say, anticipate.  This same book took up\r\nall my spare time.  It was no play to get the other articles together in\r\nthe general miscellaneous lot, but when it come to my own article!  There!\r\nI couldn't have believed the blotting, nor yet the buckling to at it, nor\r\nthe patience over it.  Which again is like the footboard.  The public\r\nhave no idea.\r\n\r\nAt last it was done, and the two years' time was gone after all the other\r\ntime before it, and where it's all gone to, who knows?  The new cart was\r\nfinished,--yellow outside, relieved with wermilion and brass\r\nfittings,--the old horse was put in it, a new 'un and a boy being laid on\r\nfor the Cheap Jack cart,--and I cleaned myself up to go and fetch her.\r\nBright cold weather it was, cart-chimneys smoking, carts pitched private\r\non a piece of waste ground over at Wandsworth, where you may see 'em from\r\nthe Sou'western Railway when not upon the road.  (Look out of the right-\r\nhand window going down.)\r\n\r\n\"Marigold,\" says the gentleman, giving his hand hearty, \"I am very glad\r\nto see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet I have my doubts, sir,\" says I, \"if you can be half as glad to see\r\nme as I am to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"The time has appeared so long,--has it, Marigold?\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't say that, sir, considering its real length; but--\"\r\n\r\n\"What a start, my good fellow!\"\r\n\r\nAh!  I should think it was!  Grown such a woman, so pretty, so\r\nintelligent, so expressive!  I knew then that she must be really like my\r\nchild, or I could never have known her, standing quiet by the door.\r\n\r\n\"You are affected,\" says the gentleman in a kindly manner.\r\n\r\n\"I feel, sir,\" says I, \"that I am but a rough chap in a sleeved\r\nwaistcoat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel,\" says the gentleman, \"that it was you who raised her from misery\r\nand degradation, and brought her into communication with her kind.  But\r\nwhy do we converse alone together, when we can converse so well with her?\r\nAddress her in your own way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am such a rough chap in a sleeved waistcoat, sir,\" says I, \"and she is\r\nsuch a graceful woman, and she stands so quiet at the door!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Try_ if she moves at the old sign,\" says the gentleman.\r\n\r\nThey had got it up together o' purpose to please me!  For when I give her\r\nthe old sign, she rushed to my feet, and dropped upon her knees, holding\r\nup her hands to me with pouring tears of love and joy; and when I took\r\nher hands and lifted her, she clasped me round the neck, and lay there;\r\nand I don't know what a fool I didn't make of myself, until we all three\r\nsettled down into talking without sound, as if there was a something soft\r\nand pleasant spread over the whole world for us.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n[A portion is here omitted from the text, having reference to the\r\nsketches contributed by other writers; but the reader will be pleased to\r\nhave what follows retained in a note:\r\n\r\n\"Now I'll tell you what I am a-going to do with you.  I am a-going to\r\noffer you the general miscellaneous lot, her own book, never read by\r\nanybody else but me, added to and completed by me after her first reading\r\nof it, eight-and-forty printed pages, six-and-ninety columns, Whiting's\r\nown work, Beaufort House to wit, thrown off by the steam-ingine, best of\r\npaper, beautiful green wrapper, folded like clean linen come home from\r\nthe clear-starcher's, and so exquisitely stitched that, regarded as a\r\npiece of needlework alone, it's better than the sampler of a seamstress\r\nundergoing a Competitive examination for Starvation before the Civil\r\nService Commissioners--and I offer the lot for what?  For eight pound?\r\nNot so much.  For six pound?  Less.  For four pound.  Why, I hardly\r\nexpect you to believe me, but that's the sum.  Four pound!  The stitching\r\nalone cost half as much again.  Here's forty-eight original pages, ninety-\r\nsix original columns, for four pound.  You want more for the money?  Take\r\nit.  Three whole pages of advertisements of thrilling interest thrown in\r\nfor nothing.  Read 'em and believe 'em.  More?  My best of wishes for\r\nyour merry Christmases and your happy New Years, your long lives and your\r\ntrue prosperities.  Worth twenty pound good if they are delivered as I\r\nsend them.  Remember!  Here's a final prescription added, \"To be taken\r\nfor life,\" which will tell you how the cart broke down, and where the\r\njourney ended.  You think Four Pound too much?  And still you think so?\r\nCome!  I'll tell you what then.  Say Four Pence, and keep the secret.\"]\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nSo every item of my plan was crowned with success.  Our reunited life was\r\nmore than all that we had looked forward to.  Content and joy went with\r\nus as the wheels of the two carts went round, and the same stopped with\r\nus when the two carts stopped.  I was as pleased and as proud as a Pug-\r\nDog with his muzzle black-leaded for a evening party, and his tail extra\r\ncurled by machinery.\r\n\r\nBut I had left something out of my calculations.  Now, what had I left\r\nout?  To help you to guess I'll say, a figure.  Come.  Make a guess and\r\nguess right.  Nought?  No.  Nine?  No.  Eight?  No.  Seven?  No.  Six?\r\nNo.  Five?  No.  Four?  No.  Three?  No.  Two?  No.  One?  No.  Now I'll\r\ntell you what I'll do with you.  I'll say it's another sort of figure\r\naltogether.  There.  Why then, says you, it's a mortal figure.  No, nor\r\nyet a mortal figure.  By such means you got yourself penned into a\r\ncorner, and you can't help guessing a _im_mortal figure.  That's about\r\nit.  Why didn't you say so sooner?\r\n\r\nYes.  It was a immortal figure that I had altogether left out of my\r\nCalculations.  Neither man's, nor woman's, but a child's.  Girl's or\r\nboy's?  Boy's.  \"I, says the sparrow with my bow and arrow.\"  Now you\r\nhave got it.\r\n\r\nWe were down at Lancaster, and I had done two nights more than fair\r\naverage business (though I cannot in honour recommend them as a quick\r\naudience) in the open square there, near the end of the street where Mr.\r\nSly's King's Arms and Royal Hotel stands.  Mim's travelling giant,\r\notherwise Pickleson, happened at the self-same time to be trying it on in\r\nthe town.  The genteel lay was adopted with him.  No hint of a van.  Green\r\nbaize alcove leading up to Pickleson in a Auction Room.  Printed poster,\r\n\"Free list suspended, with the exception of that proud boast of an\r\nenlightened country, a free press.  Schools admitted by private\r\narrangement.  Nothing to raise a blush in the cheek of youth or shock the\r\nmost fastidious.\"  Mim swearing most horrible and terrific, in a pink\r\ncalico pay-place, at the slackness of the public.  Serious handbill in\r\nthe shops, importing that it was all but impossible to come to a right\r\nunderstanding of the history of David without seeing Pickleson.\r\n\r\nI went to the Auction Room in question, and I found it entirely empty of\r\neverything but echoes and mouldiness, with the single exception of\r\nPickleson on a piece of red drugget.  This suited my purpose, as I wanted\r\na private and confidential word with him, which was: \"Pickleson.  Owing\r\nmuch happiness to you, I put you in my will for a fypunnote; but, to save\r\ntrouble, here's fourpunten down, which may equally suit your views, and\r\nlet us so conclude the transaction.\"  Pickleson, who up to that remark\r\nhad had the dejected appearance of a long Roman rushlight that couldn't\r\nanyhow get lighted, brightened up at his top extremity, and made his\r\nacknowledgments in a way which (for him) was parliamentary eloquence.  He\r\nlikewise did add, that, having ceased to draw as a Roman, Mim had made\r\nproposals for his going in as a conwerted Indian Giant worked upon by The\r\nDairyman's Daughter.  This, Pickleson, having no acquaintance with the\r\ntract named after that young woman, and not being willing to couple gag\r\nwith his serious views, had declined to do, thereby leading to words and\r\nthe total stoppage of the unfortunate young man's beer.  All of which,\r\nduring the whole of the interview, was confirmed by the ferocious\r\ngrowling of Mim down below in the pay-place, which shook the giant like a\r\nleaf.\r\n\r\nBut what was to the present point in the remarks of the travelling giant,\r\notherwise Pickleson, was this: \"Doctor Marigold,\"--I give his words\r\nwithout a hope of conweying their feebleness,--\"who is the strange young\r\nman that hangs about your carts?\"--\"The strange young _man_?\"  I gives\r\nhim back, thinking that he meant her, and his languid circulation had\r\ndropped a syllable.  \"Doctor,\" he returns, with a pathos calculated to\r\ndraw a tear from even a manly eye, \"I am weak, but not so weak yet as\r\nthat I don't know my words.  I repeat them, Doctor.  The strange young\r\nman.\"  It then appeared that Pickleson, being forced to stretch his legs\r\n(not that they wanted it) only at times when he couldn't be seen for\r\nnothing, to wit in the dead of the night and towards daybreak, had twice\r\nseen hanging about my carts, in that same town of Lancaster where I had\r\nbeen only two nights, this same unknown young man.\r\n\r\nIt put me rather out of sorts.  What it meant as to particulars I no more\r\nforeboded then than you forebode now, but it put me rather out of sorts.\r\nHowsoever, I made light of it to Pickleson, and I took leave of\r\nPickleson, advising him to spend his legacy in getting up his stamina,\r\nand to continue to stand by his religion.  Towards morning I kept a look\r\nout for the strange young man, and--what was more--I saw the strange\r\nyoung man.  He was well dressed and well looking.  He loitered very nigh\r\nmy carts, watching them like as if he was taking care of them, and soon\r\nafter daybreak turned and went away.  I sent a hail after him, but he\r\nnever started or looked round, or took the smallest notice.\r\n\r\nWe left Lancaster within an hour or two, on our way towards Carlisle.\r\nNext morning, at daybreak, I looked out again for the strange young man.\r\nI did not see him.  But next morning I looked out again, and there he was\r\nonce more.  I sent another hail after him, but as before he gave not the\r\nslightest sign of being anyways disturbed.  This put a thought into my\r\nhead.  Acting on it I watched him in different manners and at different\r\ntimes not necessary to enter into, till I found that this strange young\r\nman was deaf and dumb.\r\n\r\nThe discovery turned me over, because I knew that a part of that\r\nestablishment where she had been was allotted to young men (some of them\r\nwell off), and I thought to myself, \"If she favours him, where am I? and\r\nwhere is all that I have worked and planned for?\"  Hoping--I must confess\r\nto the selfishness--that she might _not_ favour him, I set myself to find\r\nout.  At last I was by accident present at a meeting between them in the\r\nopen air, looking on leaning behind a fir-tree without their knowing of\r\nit.  It was a moving meeting for all the three parties concerned.  I knew\r\nevery syllable that passed between them as well as they did.  I listened\r\nwith my eyes, which had come to be as quick and true with deaf and dumb\r\nconversation as my ears with the talk of people that can speak.  He was a-\r\ngoing out to China as clerk in a merchant's house, which his father had\r\nbeen before him.  He was in circumstances to keep a wife, and he wanted\r\nher to marry him and go along with him.  She persisted, no.  He asked if\r\nshe didn't love him.  Yes, she loved him dearly, dearly; but she could\r\nnever disappoint her beloved, good, noble, generous, and I-don't-know-\r\nwhat-all father (meaning me, the Cheap Jack in the sleeved waistcoat) and\r\nshe would stay with him, Heaven bless him! though it was to break her\r\nheart.  Then she cried most bitterly, and that made up my mind.\r\n\r\nWhile my mind had been in an unsettled state about her favouring this\r\nyoung man, I had felt that unreasonable towards Pickleson, that it was\r\nwell for him he had got his legacy down.  For I often thought, \"If it\r\nhadn't been for this same weak-minded giant, I might never have come to\r\ntrouble my head and wex my soul about the young man.\"  But, once that I\r\nknew she loved him,--once that I had seen her weep for him,--it was a\r\ndifferent thing.  I made it right in my mind with Pickleson on the spot,\r\nand I shook myself together to do what was right by all.\r\n\r\nShe had left the young man by that time (for it took a few minutes to get\r\nme thoroughly well shook together), and the young man was leaning against\r\nanother of the fir-trees,--of which there was a cluster,--with his face\r\nupon his arm.  I touched him on the back.  Looking up and seeing me, he\r\nsays, in our deaf-and-dumb talk, \"Do not be angry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not angry, good boy.  I am your friend.  Come with me.\"\r\n\r\nI left him at the foot of the steps of the Library Cart, and I went up\r\nalone.  She was drying her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You have been crying, my dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"A headache.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a heartache?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said a headache, father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor Marigold must prescribe for that headache.\"\r\n\r\nShe took up the book of my Prescriptions, and held it up with a forced\r\nsmile; but seeing me keep still and look earnest, she softly laid it down\r\nagain, and her eyes were very attentive.\r\n\r\n\"The Prescription is not there, Sophy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, my dear.\"\r\n\r\nI brought her young husband in, and I put her hand in his, and my only\r\nfarther words to both of them were these: \"Doctor Marigold's last\r\nPrescription.  To be taken for life.\"  After which I bolted.\r\n\r\nWhen the wedding come off, I mounted a coat (blue, and bright buttons),\r\nfor the first and last time in all my days, and I give Sophy away with my\r\nown hand.  There were only us three and the gentleman who had had charge\r\nof her for those two years.  I give the wedding dinner of four in the\r\nLibrary Cart.  Pigeon-pie, a leg of pickled pork, a pair of fowls, and\r\nsuitable garden stuff.  The best of drinks.  I give them a speech, and\r\nthe gentleman give us a speech, and all our jokes told, and the whole\r\nwent off like a sky-rocket.  In the course of the entertainment I\r\nexplained to Sophy that I should keep the Library Cart as my living-cart\r\nwhen not upon the road, and that I should keep all her books for her just\r\nas they stood, till she come back to claim them.  So she went to China\r\nwith her young husband, and it was a parting sorrowful and heavy, and I\r\ngot the boy I had another service; and so as of old, when my child and\r\nwife were gone, I went plodding along alone, with my whip over my\r\nshoulder, at the old horse's head.\r\n\r\nSophy wrote me many letters, and I wrote her many letters.  About the end\r\nof the first year she sent me one in an unsteady hand: \"Dearest father,\r\nnot a week ago I had a darling little daughter, but I am so well that\r\nthey let me write these words to you.  Dearest and best father, I hope my\r\nchild may not be deaf and dumb, but I do not yet know.\"  When I wrote\r\nback, I hinted the question; but as Sophy never answered that question, I\r\nfelt it to be a sad one, and I never repeated it.  For a long time our\r\nletters were regular, but then they got irregular, through Sophy's\r\nhusband being moved to another station, and through my being always on\r\nthe move.  But we were in one another's thoughts, I was equally sure,\r\nletters or no letters.\r\n\r\nFive years, odd months, had gone since Sophy went away.  I was still the\r\nKing of the Cheap Jacks, and at a greater height of popularity than ever.\r\nI had had a first-rate autumn of it, and on the twenty-third of December,\r\none thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, I found myself at Uxbridge,\r\nMiddlesex, clean sold out.  So I jogged up to London with the old horse,\r\nlight and easy, to have my Christmas-eve and Christmas-day alone by the\r\nfire in the Library Cart, and then to buy a regular new stock of goods\r\nall round, to sell 'em again and get the money.\r\n\r\nI am a neat hand at cookery, and I'll tell you what I knocked up for my\r\nChristmas-eve dinner in the Library Cart.  I knocked up a\r\nbeefsteak-pudding for one, with two kidneys, a dozen oysters, and a\r\ncouple of mushrooms thrown in.  It's a pudding to put a man in good\r\nhumour with everything, except the two bottom buttons of his waistcoat.\r\nHaving relished that pudding and cleared away, I turned the lamp low, and\r\nsat down by the light of the fire, watching it as it shone upon the backs\r\nof Sophy's books.\r\n\r\nSophy's books so brought Sophy's self, that I saw her touching face quite\r\nplainly, before I dropped off dozing by the fire.  This may be a reason\r\nwhy Sophy, with her deaf-and-dumb child in her arms, seemed to stand\r\nsilent by me all through my nap.  I was on the road, off the road, in all\r\nsorts of places, North and South and West and East, Winds liked best and\r\nwinds liked least, Here and there and gone astray, Over the hills and far\r\naway, and still she stood silent by me, with her silent child in her\r\narms.  Even when I woke with a start, she seemed to vanish, as if she had\r\nstood by me in that very place only a single instant before.\r\n\r\nI had started at a real sound, and the sound was on the steps of the\r\ncart.  It was the light hurried tread of a child, coming clambering up.\r\nThat tread of a child had once been so familiar to me, that for half a\r\nmoment I believed I was a-going to see a little ghost.\r\n\r\nBut the touch of a real child was laid upon the outer handle of the door,\r\nand the handle turned, and the door opened a little way, and a real child\r\npeeped in.  A bright little comely girl with large dark eyes.\r\n\r\nLooking full at me, the tiny creature took off her mite of a straw hat,\r\nand a quantity of dark curls fell about her face.  Then she opened her\r\nlips, and said in a pretty voice,\r\n\r\n\"Grandfather!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my God!\" I cries out.  \"She can speak!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear grandfather.  And I am to ask you whether there was ever any\r\none that I remind you of?\"\r\n\r\nIn a moment Sophy was round my neck, as well as the child, and her\r\nhusband was a-wringing my hand with his face hid, and we all had to shake\r\nourselves together before we could get over it.  And when we did begin to\r\nget over it, and I saw the pretty child a-talking, pleased and quick and\r\neager and busy, to her mother, in the signs that I had first taught her\r\nmother, the happy and yet pitying tears fell rolling down my face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DOCTOR MARIGOLD***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 1415.txt or 1415.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/4/1/1415\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.

A rush of fear--a sense of\r\nill, made her heart palpitate as she opened her eyes to the light of\r\nday. While she was striving to recall her thoughts, and to remember what\r\nthe evil was with which she was threatened, again the servant tapped at\r\nher door, to say that Saunders had returned, and to deliver the letter\r\nhe had brought. She looked at her watch: it was past ten o'clock. She\r\nfelt glad that it had grown so late, and she not disturbed: yet as she\r\ntook the letter brought to her from her husband, all her tremor\r\nreturned; and she read it with agitation, as if it contained the\r\nannouncement of her final doom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You send me disagreeable tidings, my sweet Ethel,\" wrote Villiers,--\"I\r\nhope unfounded; but caution is necessary: I shall not, therefore, come\r\nto Duke Street. Send me a few lines, by Saunders, to tell me if any\r\nthing has happened. If what he apprehended has really taken place, you\r\nmust bear, my love, the separation of a day. You do not understand these\r\nthings, and will wonder when I tell you, that when the clock strikes\r\ntwelve on Saturday night, the magic spells and potent charms of\r\nSaunders's friends cease to have power: at that hour I shall be restored\r\nto you. Wait till then--and _then_ we will consult for the future. Have\r\npatience, dearest love: you have wedded poverty, hardship, and\r\nannoyance; but, joined to these, is the fondest, the most faithful heart\r\nin the world;--a heart you deign to prize, so I will not repine at ill\r\nfortune. Adieu, till this evening;--and then, as Belvidera says,\r\n'Remember twelve!'\r\n\r\n\"_Saturday Morning._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter reading these lines, Ethel dressed herself hastily. Fanny Derham\r\nhad already asked permission to see her; and she found her waiting in\r\nher sitting-room. It was an unspeakable comfort to have one as\r\nintelligent and kind as Fanny, to communicate with, during Edward's\r\nabsence. The soft, pleading eyes of Ethel asked her for comfort and\r\ncounsel; and, in spite of her extreme youth, the benignant and\r\nintelligent expression of Fanny's countenance promised both.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to say,\" she said, \"that Saunders's prognostics are too\r\ntrue. Such men as he describes have been here this morning. They were\r\ntolerably civil, and I convinced them, with greater ease than I had\r\nhoped, that Mr. Villiers was absent from the house; and I assured them,\r\nthat after this visit of theirs, he was not likely to return.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you really believe that they were\"--Ethel faltered.\r\n\r\n\"Bailiffs? Assuredly,\" replied Fanny: \"they told me that they had the\r\npower to search the house; but if they were 'strong,' they were also\r\n'merciful.' And now, what do you do? Saunders tells me he is waiting to\r\ntake back a letter to Mr. Villiers, at the London Coffee House. Write\r\nquickly, while I make your breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nEthel gladly obeyed. She wrote a few words to her husband. That it was\r\nalready Saturday, cheered her: twelve at night would soon come.\r\n\r\nAfter her note was dispatched, she addressed Fanny. \"What trouble I\r\ngive,\" she said: \"what will your mother think of such degrading\r\nproceedings?\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother,\" said Fanny, \"is the kindest-hearted woman in the world. We\r\nhave never exactly suffered this disaster; but we are in a rank of life\r\nwhich causes us to be brought into contact with such among our friends\r\nand relations; and she is familiar with trouble in almost all shapes.\r\nYou are a great favourite of hers; and now that she can claim a sort of\r\nacquaintance, she will be heart and soul your friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is odd,\" observed Ethel, \"that she never mentioned you to me. Had\r\nthe name of Fanny been mentioned, I should have recollected who Mrs.\r\nDerham was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not,\" said Fanny; \"it would have required a great effort of the\r\nimagination to have fancied Mrs. Derham the wife of my father. You never\r\nknew him; but Lord Lodore made you familiar with his qualities: the most\r\nshrinking susceptibility to the world's scorn, joined to the most entire\r\nabstraction from all that is vulgar; a morbid sensibility and delicate\r\nhealth placed him in glaring contrast with my mother. They never in the\r\nleast assimilated; and her character has gained in excellence since his\r\nloss. Before she was fretted and galled by his finer feelings--now she\r\ncan be good in her own way. Nothing reminds her of his exalted\r\nsentiments, except myself; and she is willing enough to forget me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you do not repine?\" asked her friend.\r\n\r\n\"I do not: she is happy in and with Sarah. I should spoil their notions\r\nof comfort, did I mingle with them;--they would torture and destroy me,\r\ndid they interfere with me. I lost my guide, preserver, my guardian\r\nangel, when my father died. Nothing remains but the philosophy which he\r\ntaught me--the disdain of low-thoughted care which he sedulously\r\ncultivated: this, joined to my cherished independence, which my\r\ndisposition renders necessary to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And thus you foster sorrow, and waste your life in vain regrets?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me! I do not waste my life,\" replied Fanny, with her sunny\r\nsmile;--\"nor am I unhappy--far otherwise. An ardent thirst for\r\nknowledge, is as the air I breathe; and the acquisition of it, is pure\r\nand unalloyed happiness. I aspire to be useful to my fellow-creatures:\r\nbut that is a consideration for the future, when fortune shall smile on\r\nme; now I have but one passion; it swallows up every other; it dwells\r\nwith my darling books, and is fed by the treasures of beauty and wisdom\r\nwhich they contain.\"\r\n\r\nEthel could not understand. Fanny continued:--\"I aspire to be\r\nuseful;--sometimes I think I am--once I know I was. I was my father's\r\nalmoner.\r\n\r\n\"We lived in a district where there was a great deal of distress, and a\r\ngreat deal of oppression. We had no money to give, but I soon found that\r\ndetermination and earnestness will do much. Is was my father's lesson,\r\nthat I should never fear any thing but myself. He taught me to\r\npenetrate, to anatomize, to purify my motives; but once assured of my\r\nown integrity, to be afraid of nothing. Words have more power than any\r\none can guess; it is by words that the world's great fight, now in these\r\ncivilized times, is carried on; I never hesitated to use them, when I\r\nfought any battle for the miserable and oppressed. People are so afraid\r\nto speak, it would seem as if half our fellow-creatures were born with\r\ndeficient organs; like parrots they can repeat a lesson, but their voice\r\nfails them, when that alone is wanting to make the tyrant quail.\"\r\n\r\nAs Fanny spoke, her blue eyes brightened, and a smile irradiated her\r\nface; these were all the tokens of enthusiasm she displayed, yet her\r\nwords moved Ethel strangely, and she looked on her with wonder as a\r\nsuperior being. Her youth gave grace to her sentiments, and were an\r\nassurance of their sincerity. She continued:--\r\n\r\n\"I am becoming flightly, as my mother calls it; but, as I spoke, many\r\nscenes of cottage distress passed through my memory, when, holding my\r\nfather's hand, I witnessed his endeavours to relieve the poor. That is\r\nall over now--he is gone, and I have but one consolation--that of\r\nendeavouring to render myself worthy to rejoin him in a better world. It\r\nis this hope that impels me continually and without any flagging of\r\nspirit, to cultivate my understanding and to refine it. O what has this\r\nlife to give, as worldlings describe it, worth one of those glorious\r\nemotions, which raise me from this petty sphere, into the sun-bright\r\nregions of mind, which my father inhabits! I am rewarded even here by\r\nthe elevated feelings which the authors, whom I love so passionately,\r\ninspire; while I converse each day with Plato, and Cicero, and\r\nEpictetus, the world, as it is, passes from before me like a vain\r\nshadow.\"\r\n\r\nThese enthusiastic words were spoken with so calm a manner, and in so\r\nequable a voice, that there seemed nothing strange nor exaggerated in\r\nthem. It is vanity and affectation that shock, or any manifestation of\r\nfeeling not in accordance with the real character. But while we follow\r\nour natural bent, and only speak that which our minds spontaneously\r\ninspire, there is a harmony, which, however novel, is never grating.\r\nFanny Derham spoke of things, which, to use her own expression, were to\r\nher as the air she breathed, and the simplicity of her manner entirely\r\nobviated the wonder which the energy of her expressions might occasion.\r\n\r\nSuch a woman as Fanny was more made to be loved by her own sex than by\r\nthe opposite one. Superiority of intellect, joined to acquisitions\r\nbeyond those usual even to men; and both announced with frankness,\r\nthough without pretension, forms a kind of anomaly little in accord with\r\nmasculine taste. Fanny could not be the rival of women, and, therefore,\r\nall her merits were appreciated by them. They love to look up to a\r\nsuperior being, to rest on a firmer support than their own minds can\r\nafford; and they are glad to find such in one of their own sex, and thus\r\ndestitute of those dangers which usually attend any services conferred\r\nby men.\r\n\r\nFrom talk like this, they diverged to subjects nearer to the heart of\r\nEthel. They spoke of Lord Lodore, and her father's name soothed her\r\nagitation even more than the consolatory arguments of her friend. She\r\nremembered how often he had talked of the trials to which the constancy of\r\nher temper and the truth of her affection might be put, and she felt her\r\ncourage rise to encounter those now before her, without discontent, or\r\nrather with that cheerful fortitude, which sheds grace over the rugged\r\nform of adversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marian._ Could you so long be absent?\r\n_Robin._ What a week?\r\nWas that so long?\r\n_Marian._ How long are lovers' weeks,\r\nDo you think, Robin, when they are asunder?\r\nAre they not pris'ners' years?\r\n\r\nBEN JONSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day passed on more lightly than Ethel could have hoped; much of it\r\nindeed was gone before she opened her eyes to greet it. Night soon\r\nclosed in, and she busied herself with arrangements for the welcome of\r\nher husband. Fanny loved solitude too well herself not to believe that\r\nothers shared her taste. She retired therefore when evening commenced.\r\nNo sooner was Ethel alone, than every image except Edward's passed out\r\nof her mind. Her heart was bursting with affection. Every other idea and\r\nthought, to use a chemical expression, was held in solution by that\r\npowerful feeling, which mingled and united with every particle of her\r\nsoul. She could not write nor read; if she attempted, before she had\r\nfinished the shortest sentence, she found that her understanding was\r\nwandering, and she re-read it with no better success. It was as if a\r\nspring, a gush from the fountain of love poured itself in, bearing away\r\nevery object which she strove to throw upon the stream of thought, till\r\nits own sweet waters alone filled the channel through which it flowed.\r\nShe gave herself up to the bewildering influence, and almost forgot to\r\ncount the hours till Edward's expected arrival. At last it was ten\r\no'clock, and then the sting of impatience and uncertainty was felt. It\r\nappeared to her as if a whole age had passed since she had seen or heard\r\nof him--as if countless events and incalculable changes might have taken\r\nplace. She read again and again his note, to assure herself that she\r\nmight really expect him: the minutes meanwhile stood still, or were told\r\nheavily by the distinct beating of her heart. The east wind bore to her\r\near the sound of the quarters of hours, as they chimed from various\r\nchurches. At length eleven, half-past eleven was passed, and the hand of\r\nher watch began to climb slowly upwards toward the zenith, which she\r\ndesired so ardently that it should reach. She gazed on the dial-plate,\r\ntill she fancied that the pointers did not move; she placed her hands\r\nbefore her eyes resolutely, and would not look for a long long time;\r\nthree minutes had not been travelled over when again she viewed it; she\r\ntried to count her pulse, as a measurement of time; her trembling\r\nfingers refused to press the fluttering artery. At length another\r\nquarter of an hour elapsed, and then the succeeding one hurried on more\r\nspeedily. Clock after clock struck; they mingled their various tones, as\r\nthe hour of twelve was tolled throughout London. It seemed as if they\r\nwould never end. Silence came at last--a brief silence succeeded by a\r\nfirm quick step in the street below, and a knock at the door. \"Is he not\r\ntoo soon?\" poor fearful Ethel asked herself. But no; and in a moment\r\nafter, he was with her, safe in her glad embrace.\r\n\r\nPerhaps of the two, Villiers showed himself the most enraptured at this\r\nmeeting. He gazed on his sweet wife, followed every motion, and hung\r\nupon her voice, with all the delight of an exile, restored to his\r\nlong-lost home. \"What a transporting change,\" he said, \"to find myself\r\nwith you--to see you in the same room with me--to know again that,\r\nlovely and dear as you are, that you are mine--that I am again\r\nmyself--not the miserable dog that has been wandering about all day--a\r\nbody without a soul! For a few short hours, at least, Ethel will call me\r\nhers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, indeed, love,\" she replied, \"we will not be separated again.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will not even think about that tonight,\" said Villiers. \"The future\r\nis dark and blank, the present as radiant as your own sweet self can\r\nmake it.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day--and the following day did come, in spite of\r\nEthel's wishes, which would have held back the progress of time: it came\r\nand passed away; hour after hour stealing along, till it dwindled to a\r\nmere point. On the following day, they consulted earnestly on what was\r\nto be done. Villiers was greatly averse to Ethel's leaving her present\r\nabode, where every one was so very kind and attentive to her, and he was\r\nsanguine in his hopes of obtaining in the course of the week, just\r\ncommenced, a sum, sufficient to carry them to Paris or Brussels, were\r\nthey could remain till his affairs were finally arranged, and the\r\npayment of his debts regulated in a way to satisfy his creditors. One\r\nweek of absence; Villiers used all his persuasion to induce Ethel to\r\nsubmit to it. \"Where you can be, I can be also,\" was her answer; and she\r\nlistened unconvinced to the detail of the inconveniences which Villiers\r\npointed out: at last he almost got angry. \"I could call you unkind,\r\nEthel,\" he said, \"not to yield to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will yield to you,\" said Ethel, \"but you are wrong to ask me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that,\" replied her husband, \"do concede this point, dearest;\r\nif not because it is best that you should, then because I wish it, and\r\nask it of you. You say that your first desire is to make me happy, and\r\nyou pain me exceedingly by your--I had almost said perverseness.\"\r\n\r\nThus, not convinced, but obedient, Ethel agreed to allow him to depart\r\nalone. She bargained that she should be permitted to come each day in a\r\nhackney coach to a place where he might meet her, and they could spend\r\nan hour or two together. Edward did not like this plan at all, but there\r\nwas no remedy. \"You are at least resolved,\" he said, \"to spur my\r\nendeavours; I will not rest day or night, till I am enabled to get away\r\nfrom this vast dungeon.\"\r\n\r\nThe hours stole on. Even Edward's buoyant spirits could not bear up\r\nagainst the sadness of watching the fleeting moments till the one should\r\ncome, which must separate him from his wife. \"This nice, dear room,\" he\r\nsaid, \"I am sure I beg its pardon for having despised it so much\r\nformerly--it is not as lofty as a church, nor as grand as a palace, but\r\nit is very snug; and now you are in it, I discern even elegance in its\r\nexceedingly queer tables and chairs. When our carriage broke down on the\r\nApennines, how glad we should have been if a room like this had risen,\r\n'like an exhalation' for our shelter! Do you remember the barn of a\r\nplace we got into there, and our droll bed of the leaves of Indian corn,\r\nwhich crackled all night long, and awoke us twenty times with the fear\r\nof robbers? Then, indeed, twelve o'clock was not to separate us!\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this he sighed; the hour of eleven was indicated by Ethel's\r\nwatch, and still he lingered; but she grew frightened for him, and\r\nforced him to go away, while he besought the delay of but a few minutes.\r\n\r\nEthel exerted herself to endure as well as she could the separation of\r\nthe ensuing week. She was not of a repining disposition, yet she found\r\nit very hard to bear. The discomfort to which Villiers was exposed\r\nannoyed her, and the idea that she was not permitted to alleviate it\r\nadded to her painful feelings. In her prospect of life every evil was\r\nneutralized when shared--now they were doubled, because the pain of\r\nabsence from each other was superadded. She did not yield to her\r\nhusband, in her opinion that this was wrong. She was willing to go\r\nanywhere with him, and where he was, she also could be. There could be\r\nno degradation in a wife waiting on the fallen fortunes of her husband.\r\nNo debasement can arise from any services dictated by love. It is\r\ndespicable to submit to hardship for unworthy and worldly objects, but\r\nevery thing that is suffered for the sake of affection, is hallowed by\r\nthe disinterested sentiment, and affords triumph and delight to the\r\nwilling victim. Sometimes she tried in speech or on paper to express\r\nthese feelings, and so by the force of irresistible reasoning to\r\npersuade Edward to permit her to join him; but all argument was weak;\r\nthere was something beyond, that no words could express, which was\r\nstronger than any reason in her heart. Who can express the power of\r\nfaithful and single-hearted love? As well attempt to define the laws of\r\nlife, which occasions a continuity of feeling from the brain to the\r\nextremity of the frame, as try to explain how love can so unite two\r\nsouls, as to make each feel maimed and half alive, while divided. A\r\npowerful impulse was perpetually urging Ethel to go--to place herself\r\nnear Villiers--to refuse to depart. It was with the most violent\r\nstruggles that she overcame the instigation.\r\n\r\nShe never could forget herself while away from him, or find the\r\nslightest alleviation to her disquietude, except while conversing with\r\nFanny Derham, or rather while drawing her out, and listening to her, and\r\nwondering at a mechanism of mind so different from her own. Each had\r\nbeen the favourite daughter of men of superior qualities of mind. They\r\nhad been educated by their several fathers with the most sedulous care,\r\nand nothing could be more opposite than the result, except that, indeed,\r\nboth made duty the master motive of their actions. Ethel had received,\r\nso to speak, a sexual education. Lord Lodore had formed his ideal of what a\r\nwoman ought to be, of what he had wished to find his wife, and sought to\r\nmould his daughter accordingly. Mr. Derham contemplated the duties and\r\nobjects befitting an immortal soul, and had educated his child for the\r\nperformance of them. The one fashioned his offspring to be the wife of a\r\nfrail human being, and instructed her to be yielding, and to make it her\r\nduty to devote herself to his happiness, and to obey his will. The other\r\nsought to guard his from all weakness, to make her complete in herself,\r\nand to render her independent and self-sufficing. Born to poverty as\r\nFanny was, it was thus only that she could find happiness in rising\r\nabove her sphere; and, besides, a sense of pride, surviving his sense of\r\ninjury, caused him to wish that his child should set her heart on higher\r\nthings, than the distinctions and advantages of riches or rank; so that\r\nif ever brought into collision with his own family, she could look down\r\nwith calm superiority on the \"low ambition\" of the wealthy. While Ethel\r\nmade it her happiness and duty to give herself away with unreserved\r\nprodigality to him, whom she thought had every claim to her entire\r\ndevotion; Fanny zealously guarded her individuality, and would have\r\nscorned herself could she have been brought to place the treasures of\r\nher soul at the disposal of any power, except those moral laws which it\r\nwas her earnest endeavour never to transgress. Religion, reason, and\r\njustice--these were the landmarks of her life. She was kind-hearted,\r\ngenerous, and true--so also was Ethel; but the one was guided by the\r\ntenderness of her heart, while the other consulted her understanding,\r\nand would have died rather than have acted contrary to its dictates.\r\n\r\nTo guard Ethel from every contamination, Lord Lodore had secluded her from\r\nall society, and forestalled every circumstance that might bring her into\r\nconjunction with her fellow-creatures. He was equally careful to prevent\r\nher fostering any pride, except that of sex; and never spoke to her as\r\nif she were of an elevated rank: and the communication, however small,\r\nwhich she necessarily had with the Americans, made such ideas foreign to\r\nher mind. But she was excedingly shy; tremblingly alive to the slightest\r\nrepulse; and never perfectly fearless, (morally so, that is), except\r\nwhen under the shelter of another's care. Fanny's first principle was,\r\nthat what she ought to do, that she could do, without hesitation or\r\nregard for obstacles. She had something Quixotic in her nature; or\r\nrather she would have had, if a clear head and some experience, even\r\nyoung as she was, had not stood in the way of her making any glaring\r\nmistakes; so that her enterprises were never ridiculous; and being\r\nusually successful, could not be called extravagant. For herself, she\r\nneeded but her liberty and her books;--for others, she had her time, her\r\nthoughts, her decided and resolute modes of action, all at their\r\ncommand, whenever she was convinced that they had a just claim upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt was singular that the resolute and unshrinking Fanny should be the\r\ndaughter of Francis Derham; and the timid, retiring Ethel, of his bold\r\nand daring protector. But this is no uncommon case. We feel the evil\r\nresults of our own faults, and endeavour to guard our children from\r\nthem; forgetful that the opposite extreme has also its peculiar dangers.\r\nLord Lodore attributed his early misfortunes to the too great freedom he\r\nhad enjoyed, or rather to the unlimited scope given to his will, from his\r\nbirth. Mr. Derham saw the unhappiness that had sprung from his own\r\nyielding and undecided disposition. The one brought up his child to\r\ndependence; the other taught his to disdain every support, except the\r\napplause of her own conscience. Lodore fostered all the sensibility, all\r\nthe softness, of Ethel's feminine and delicat nature; while Fanny's\r\nfather strove to harden and confirm a character, in itself singularly\r\nstedfast and upright.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the great contrast thus exhibited between Ethel and Fanny,\r\none quality created a good deal of similarity between them. There was in\r\nboth a total absence of every factitious sentiment. They acted from\r\ntheir own hearts--from their own sense of right, without the\r\nintervention of worldly considerations. A feeling of duty ruled all\r\ntheir actions; and, however excellent a person's dispositions may be, it\r\nyet requires considerable elevation of character never to deviate from\r\nthe strict line of honour and integrity.\r\n\r\nFanny's society a little relieved Ethel's solitude: yet that did not\r\nweigh on her; and had she not been the child of her father's earliest\r\nfriend, and the companion of past days, she would have been disinclined,\r\nat this period, to cultivate an intimacy with her. She needed no\r\ncompanion except the thought of Edward, which was never absent from her\r\nmind. But amidst all her affection for her husband, which gained\r\nstrength, and, as it were, covered each day a larger portion of her\r\nbeing, any one associated with the name of Lodore--of her beloved father,\r\nhad a magic power to call forth her warmest feelings of interest. Both\r\nladies repeated to each other what they had heard from their several\r\nparents. Mr. Derham had, among his many lessons of usefulness, descanted\r\non the generosity and boldness of Fitzhenry, as offering an example to\r\nbe followed. And during the last months of Lodore's life, he had\r\nrecurred, with passionate fondness, to the memory of his early years,\r\nand painted in glowing colours the delicacy of feeling, the deep sense\r\nof gratitude, and the latent but fervid enthusiasm, which adorned the\r\ncharacter of Francis Derham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nIt does much trouble me to live without you:\r\nOur loves and loving souls have been so used\r\nTo one household in us.\r\n\r\nBEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe week passed on. It was the month of January, and very cold. A black\r\nfrost bound up every thing with ice, and the piercing air congealed the\r\nvery blood. Each day Ethel went to see her husband;--each day she had to\r\nencounter Mrs. Derham's intreaties not to go, and the reproaches of\r\nVilliers for coming. Both were unavailing to prevent the daily\r\npilgrimage. Mrs. Derham sighed heavily when she saw her enter the\r\nricketty hackney-coach, whose damp lining, gaping windows, and miserable\r\nstraw, made it a _cold-bed_ for catarrh--a very temple for the spirit of\r\nwinter. Villiers each day besought her to have horses put to their\r\nchariot, if she must come; but Ethel remembered all he had ever said of\r\nexpense, and his prognostications of how ill she would be able to endure\r\nthe petty, yet galling annoyances of poverty; and she resolved to prove,\r\nthat she could cheerfully bear every thing except separation from him.\r\nWith this laudable motive to incite her, she tasked her strength too\r\nfar. She kept up her spirits to meet him with a cheerful countenance;\r\nand she contrived to conceal the sufferings she endured while they were\r\ntogether. They got out and walked now and then; and this tended to keep\r\nup the vital warmth. Their course was generally taken over Blackfriars\r\nBridge; and it was on their return across the river, on whose surface\r\nlarge masses of ice floated, while a bitter north-east wind swept up,\r\nbearing on its blasts the unthawed breath of the German Ocean, that she\r\nfelt the cold enter her heart, and make her head feel dizzy. Still she\r\ncould smile, and ask Villiers why he objected to her taking an exercise\r\neven necessary for her health; and repeat again and again, that, bred in\r\nAmerica, an English winter was but a faint reflex of what she had\r\nencountered there, and insist upon being permitted to come on the\r\nfollowing day. These were precious moments in her eyes, worth all the\r\npain they occasioned,--well worth the struggle she made for the\r\nrepetition. Edward's endearing attentions--the knowledge she had that\r\nshe was loved--the swelling and earnest affection that warmed her own\r\nheart,--hallowed these hard-earned minutes, and gave her the sweet\r\npleasure of knowing that she demonstrated, in some slight degree, the\r\nprofound and all engrossing attachment which pervaded her entire being.\r\nThey parted; and often she arrived nearly senseless at Duke Street, and\r\nonce or twice fainted on entering the warm room: but it was not pain she\r\nfelt then--the emotions of the soul conquered the sensation of her body,\r\nand pleasure, the intense pleasure of affection, was predominant through\r\nall.\r\n\r\nSunday came again, and brought Villiers to her home. Mrs. Derham took\r\nthe opportunity to represent to him the injury that Ethel was doing\r\nherself; and begged him, as he cared for her health, to forbid her\r\nexposing herself to the inclement weather.\r\n\r\n\"You hear this, Ethel,\" said Villiers; \"and yet you are obstinate. It\r\nthis right? What can I urge, what can I do, to prevent this wrong-headed\r\npertinacity?\"\r\n\r\n\"You use such very hard words,\" replied Ethel, smiling, \"that you\r\nfrighten me into believing myself criminal. But so far am I from\r\nconceding, that you only give me courage to say, that I cannot any\r\nlonger endure the sad and separate life we lead. It must be changed,\r\ndearest; we must be together.\"\r\n\r\nVilliers was pacing the room impatiently: with an exclamation almost\r\napproaching to anger, he stopped before his wife, to remonstrate and to\r\nreproach. But as he gazed upon her upturned face, fixed so beseechingly\r\nand fondly on him, he fancied that he saw the hues of ill-health\r\nstealing across her cheeks, and thinness displacing the roundness of her\r\nform. A strange emotion flashed across him; a new fear, too terrible\r\neven to be acknowledged to himself, which passed, like the shadow of a\r\nstorm, across his anticipations, and filled him with inquietude. His\r\nreprehension was changed to a caress, as he said, \"You are right, my\r\nlove, quite right; we must not live thus. You are unable to take care of\r\nyourself; and I am very wrong to give up my dearest privilege, of\r\nwatching day and night over the welfare of my only treasure. We will be\r\ntogether, Ethel; if the worst come, it cannot be very bad, while we are\r\ntrue to each other.\"\r\n\r\nTears filled the poor girl's eyes--tears of joy and tenderness--at\r\nhearing Edward echo the sentiments she cherished as the most sacred in\r\nthe world. For a few minutes, they forgot every thing in the\r\naffectionate kiss, which ratified, as it were, this new law; and then\r\nEdward considered how best he could carry it into effect.\r\n\r\n\"Gayland,\" he said, (he was his solicitor,) \"has appointed to see me on\r\nThursday morning, and has good hopes of definitively arranging the\r\nconditions for the loan of the five hundred pounds, which is to enable\r\nus to wait for better things. On Thursday evening, we will leave town.\r\nWe will go to some pretty country inn, to wait till I have signed these\r\npapers; and trust to Providence that no ill will arise. We must not be\r\nmore than fifteen or twenty miles from London; so that when I am obliged\r\nto go up, I can return again in a few hours. Tell me, sweet, does this\r\nscheme please you?\"\r\n\r\nEthel expressed her warmest gratitude; and then Villiers insinuated his\r\ncondition, that she should not come to see him in the interval, but\r\nremain, taking care of herself, till, on Thursday afternoon, at six\r\no'clock, she came, with their chariot, to the northern side of St.\r\nPaul's Churchyard, where he would immediately join her. They might\r\nwrite, meanwhile: he promised letters as long as if they were to go to\r\nIndia; and soothed her annoyance with every expression of thankfulness\r\nat her giving up this point. She did give it up, with all the readiness\r\nshe could muster; and this increased, as he dwelt upon the enjoyment\r\nthey would share, in exchanging foggy, smoky London, for the\r\never-pleasing aspect of nature, which, even during frost and snow,\r\npossesses her own charms--her own wonders; and can gratify our senses by\r\na thousand forms of beauty, which have no existence in a dingy\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\nWhen the evening hour came for the young pair to separate, their hearts\r\nwere cheered by the near prospect of re-union; and a belief that the, to\r\nthem, trivial privations of poverty were the only ones they would have\r\nto endure. The thrill of fear which had crossed the mind of Villiers, as\r\nto the health and preservation of his wife, had served to dissipate the\r\nlingering sense of shame and degradation inspired by the penury of their\r\nsituation. He felt that there was something better than wealth, and the\r\nattendance of his fellow-creatures; something worse than poverty, and\r\nthe world's scorn. Within the fragile form of Ethel, there beat a heart\r\nof more worth than a king's ransom; and its pulsations were ruled by\r\nhim. To lose her! What would all that earth can afford, of power or\r\nsplendour, appear without her? He pressed her to his bosom, and knew\r\nthat his arms encircled all life's worth for him. Never again could he\r\nforget the deep-felt appreciation of her value, which then took root in\r\nhis mind; while she, become conscious, by force of sympathy, of the kind\r\nof revolution that was made in his sentiments, felt that the foundations\r\nof her life grew strong, and that her hopes in this world became\r\nstedfast and enduring. Before, a wall of separation, however slight, had\r\ndivided them; they had followed a system of conduct independent of each\r\nother, and passed their censure upon the ideas of either. This was over\r\nnow--they were one--one sense of right--one feeling of happiness; and\r\nwhen they parted that night, each felt that they truly possessed the\r\nother; and that by mingling every hope and wish, they had confirmed the\r\nmarriage of their hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . . . . Think but whither\r\nNow you can go; what you can do to live;\r\nHow near you have barred all ports to your own\r\nsuccour.\r\nExcept this one that here I open, love.\r\n\r\nBEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most pleasing thoughts shed their balmy influence on Ethel's repose\r\nthat night. Edward's scheme of a country inn, where the very freedom\r\nwould make them more entirely dependent upon each other, was absolutely\r\nenchanting. Where we establish ourselves, and look forward to the\r\npassage of a long interval of time, we form ties with, and assume duties\r\ntowards, many of our fellow-creatures, each of which must diminish the\r\nsingleness of the soul's devotion towards the selected one. No doubt\r\nthis is the fitting position for human beings to place themselves in, as\r\naffording a greater scope for utility: but for a brief space, to have no\r\noccupation but that of contributing to the happiness of him to whom her\r\nlife was consecrated, appeared to Ethel a very heaven upon earth. It was\r\nnot that she was narrow-hearted: so much affection demands a spacious\r\nmansion for its abode; but in their present position of struggle and\r\ndifficulty, there was no possibility of extending her sphere of\r\nbenevolence, and she gladly concentrated her endeavours in the one\r\nobject whose happiness was in her hands.\r\n\r\nAll night, even in sleep, a peculiar sense of calm enjoyment soothed the\r\nmind of Ethel, and she awoke in the morning with buoyant spirits, and a\r\nsoul all alive to its own pleasurable existence. She sat at her little\r\nsolitary breakfast table, musing with still renewed delight upon the\r\nprospect opened before her, when suddenly she was startled by the vision\r\nof an empty purse. What could Villiers intend? She felt assured that his\r\nstock was very nearly exhausted, and for herself two sovereigns, which\r\nwere not sufficient to meet the demands of the last week, was all that\r\nshe possessed. She tried to recollect if Edward had said any thing that\r\ndenoted any expectation of receiving money; on the contrary--diving into\r\nthe recesses of her memory, she called to mind that he had said, \"We\r\nshall receive your poor little dividend of a hundred pounds, in less\r\nthan a fortnight, so we shall be able to live, even if Gayland should\r\ndelay getting the other money--I suppose we have enough to get on till\r\nthen.\"\r\n\r\nHe had said this inquiringly, and she knew that she had made a sign of\r\nassent, though at the time, she had no thought of the real purport of\r\nhis question or of her answer. What was to be done? The obvious\r\nconsequence of her reflections was at once to destroy the cherished\r\nscheme of going out of town with Villiers. This was a misfortune too\r\ngreat to bear, and she at last decided upon having again recourse to her\r\naunt. Unused to every money transaction, she had not that terror of\r\nobligation, nor dislike of asking, which is so necessary to preserve our\r\nindependence, and even our sense of justice, through life. Money had\r\nalways been placed like counters in her hand; she had never known whence\r\nit came, and until her marriage, she had never disposed of more than\r\nvery small sums. Subsequently Villiers had been the director of their\r\nexpenses. This was the faulty part of her father's system of education.\r\nBut Lodore's domestic habits were for a great part founded on experience in\r\nforeign countries, and he forgot that an English wife is usually the\r\ncashier--the sole controller of the disbursements of her family. It\r\nseemed as easy a thing for Ethel to ask for money from Mrs. Fitzhenry,\r\nas she knew it would be easy for her to give. In compliance, however,\r\nwith Villiers's notions, she limited her request to ten pounds, and tried\r\nto word her letter so as to create no suspicion in her aunt's mind with\r\nregard to their resources. This task achieved, she dismissed every\r\nannoying thought, and when Fanny came to express her hope, that, bleak\r\nand snowy as was the day, she did not intend to make her accustomed\r\npilgrimage, with a countenance beaming with delight, she dilated on\r\ntheir plan, and spoke as if on the much-desired Thursday, the gates of\r\nElysium were to be thrown open for her.\r\n\r\nThere would have appeared something childish in her gladness to the\r\nabstracted and philosophic mind of Fanny, but that the real evils of her\r\nsituation, and the fortitude, touching in its unconscious simplicity,\r\nwith which she encountered them, commanded respect. Ethel, as well as\r\nher friend, was elevated above the common place of life; she also\r\nfostered a state of mind, \"lofty and magnificent, fitted rather to\r\ncommand than to obey, not only suffering patiently, but even making\r\nlight of all human cares; a grand and dignified self-possession, which\r\nfears nothing, yields to no one, and remains for ever unvanquished.\"\r\nWhen Fanny, in one of their conversations, while describing the uses of\r\nphilosophy, had translated this eulogium of its effects from Cicero,\r\nEthel had exclaimed, \"This is love--it is love alone that divides us\r\nfrom sordid earthborn thoughts, and causes us to walk alone, girt by its\r\nown beauty and power.\"\r\n\r\nFanny smiled; yet while she saw slavery rather than a proud independence\r\nin the creed of Ethel, she admired the warmth of heart which could endow\r\nwith so much brilliancy a state of privation and solitude. At the\r\npresent moment, when Mrs. Villiers was rapturously announcing their\r\nscheme for leaving London, an expression of pain mantled over Fanny's\r\nfeatures; her clear blue eyes became suffused, a large tear gathered on\r\nher lashes. \"What is the matter?\" asked Ethel anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"That I am a fool--but pardon me, for the folly is already passed away.\r\nFor the first time you have made it hard for me to keep my soul firm in\r\nits own single existence. I have been debarred from all intercourse with\r\nthose whose ideas rise above the soil on which they tread, except in my\r\ndear books, and I thought I should never be attached to any thing but\r\nthem. Yet do not think me selfish, Mr. Villiers is quite right--it is\r\nmuch better that you should not be apart--I am delighted with his plan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Away or near, dear Fanny,\" said Ethel, in a caressing tone, \"I never\r\ncan forget your kindness--never cease to feel the warmest friendship for\r\nyou. Remember, our fathers were friends, and their children ought to\r\ninherit the same faithful attachment.\"\r\n\r\nFanny smiled faintly. \"You must not seduce me from my resolves,\" she\r\nsaid. \"I know my fate in this world, and I am determined to be true to\r\nmyself to the end. Yet I am not ungrateful to you, even while I declare,\r\nthat I shall do my best to forget this brief interval, during which, I\r\nhave no longer, like Demogorgon, lived alone in my own world, but become\r\naware that there are ties of sympathy between me and my\r\nfellow-creatures, in whose existence I did not believe before.\"\r\n\r\nFanny's language, drawn from her books, not because she tried to\r\nimitate, but because conversing perpetually with them, it was natural\r\nthat she should adopt their style, was always energetic and imaginative;\r\nbut her quiet manner destroyed every idea of exaggeration of sentiment:\r\nit was necessary to hear her soft and low, but very distinct voice utter\r\nher lofty sentiments, to be conscious that the calm of deep waters was\r\nthe element in which she dwelt--not the fretful breakers that spend\r\nthemselves in sound.\r\n\r\nThe day seemed rather long to Ethel, who counted the hours until\r\nThursday. Gladly she laid her head on the pillow at night, and bade\r\nadieu to the foregone hours. The first thing that awoke her in the\r\nmorning, was the postman's knock; it brought, as she had been promised,\r\na long, long letter from Edward. He had never before written with so\r\nmuch affection or with such an overflowing of tenderness, that made her\r\nthe centre of his world--the calm fair lake to receive into its bosom\r\nthe streams of thought and feeling which flowed from him, and yet which,\r\nafter all, had their primal source in her. \"I am a very happy girl,\"\r\nthought Ethel, as she kissed the beloved papers, and gazed on them in\r\necstasy; \"more happy than I thought it was ever given us to be in this\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nShe rose and began to dress; she delayed reading more than a line or\r\ntwo, that she might enjoy her dearest pleasure for a longer time--then\r\nagain, unable to controul her impatience, she sat half dressed, and\r\nfinished all--and was begining anew, when there was a tap at her door.\r\nIt was Fanny. She looked disturbed and anxious, and Ethel's fears were\r\nin a moment awake.\r\n\r\n\"Something annoying has occurred,\" she said; \"yet I do not think that\r\nthere is any thing to dread, though there is a danger to prevent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak quickly,\" cried Ethel, \"do not keep me in suspense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be calm--it is nothing sudden, it is only a repetition of the old\r\nstory. A boy has just been here--a boy you gave a sovereign to--do you\r\nremember?--the night of your arrival. It seems that he has vowed himself\r\nto your service ever since. Those two odious men, who were here once,\r\nare often at his master's place-an alehouse, you know. Well, yesterday\r\nnight, he overheard them saying, that Mr. Villiers's resort at the London\r\ncoffee-house, was discovered, or at least suspected, and that a writ was\r\nto be taken out against him in the city.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that mean?\" cried Ethel.\r\n\r\n\"That Mr. Villiers will probably be arrested to-day, or to-morrow, if he\r\nremains where he is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go directly to him,\" cried Ethel; \"we must leave town at once.\r\nGod grant that I am not too late!\"\r\n\r\nSeeing her extreme agitation, Fanny remained with her--forced her to\r\ntake some breakfast, and then, fearing that if any thing had really\r\ntaken place, she would be quite bewildered, asked her permission to\r\naccompany her. \"Will you indeed come with me?\" Ethel exclaimed, \"How\r\ndear, how good you are! O yes, do come--I can never go through it all\r\nalone; I shall die, if I do not find him.\"\r\n\r\nA hackney coach had been called, and they hastened with what speed they\r\nmight, to their destination. A kind of panic seized upon Ethel, a tremor\r\nshook her limbs, so that when they at last stopped, she was unable to\r\nspeak. Fanny was about to ask for Mr. Villiers, when an exclamation of\r\njoy from Ethel stopped her; Edward had seen them, and was at the coach\r\ndoor. The snow lay thick around on the roofs of the houses, and on every\r\natom of vantage ground it could obtain; it was then snowing, and as the\r\nchilly fleece dropped through or was driven about in the dark\r\natmosphere, it spread a most disconsolate appearance over every thing;\r\nand nothing could look more dreary than poor Ethel's jumbling vehicle,\r\nwith its drooping animals, and the half-frozen driver. Villiers had made\r\nup his mind that he should never be mortified by seeing her again in\r\nthis sort of equipage, and he hurried down, the words of reproach\r\nalready on his lips, \"Is this your promise?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dearest, it is. Come in, there is danger here.--Come in--we must\r\ngo directly.\"\r\n\r\nSeeing Fanny, Villiers became aware that there was some absolute cause\r\nfor their journey, so he obeyed and quickly heard the danger that\r\nthreatened him. \"It would have been better,\" he said, \"that you had come\r\nin the carriage, and that we had instantly left town.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" cried Ethel; \"till to-morrow--that is quite impossible. We\r\nhave no money until to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my love, since it is so, we must arrange as well as we can. Do\r\nyou return home immediately--this cold will kill you. I will take care\r\nof myself, and you can come for me on Thursday evening, as we proposed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not ask it of me, Edward,\" said Ethel; \"I cannot leave you. I could\r\nnever live through these two days away from you--you must not desire\r\nit--you will kill me.\"\r\n\r\nEdward kissed her pale cheek. \"You tremble,\" he said; \"how violently you\r\ntremble! Good God! what can we do? What would you have me do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Any thing, so that we remain together. It is of so little consequence\r\nwhere we pass the next twenty-four hours, so that we are together. There\r\nare many hotels in town.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must not venture to any of these; and then to take you in this\r\nmiserable manner, without servants, or any thing to command attendance.\r\nBut you shall have your own way; having deprived you of every other\r\nluxury, at least, you shall have your will; which, you know, compensates\r\nfor every thing with your obstinate sex.\"\r\n\r\nEthel smiled, rejoicing to find him in so good and accommodating a\r\nhumour. \"Yes, pretty one,\" he continued, marking her feelings, \"you\r\nshall be as wretched and uncomfortable as your heart can desire. We will\r\nplay the incognito in such a style, that if our adventures were printed,\r\nthey would compete with those of Don Quixote and the fair Dulcinea. But\r\nMiss Derham must not be admitted into our vagabondizing--we will not\r\ndetain her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet she must know whither we are going, to bring us the letters that\r\nwill confer freedom on us.\"\r\n\r\nVilliers wrote hastily an address on a card. \"You will find us there,\"\r\nhe said. \"Do not mention names when you come. We shall remain, I\r\nsuppose, till Thursday.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we shall see you some time to-morrow, dear Fanny?\" asked Ethel.\r\nAlready she looked bright and happy; she esteemed herself fortunate to\r\nhave gained so easily a point she had feared she must struggle for--or\r\nperhaps give up altogether. Fanny left them, and the coachman having\r\nreceived his directions, drove slowly on through the deep snow, which\r\nfell thickly on the road; while they, nestling close to each other, were\r\nso engrossed by the gladness of re-union, that had Cinderella's\r\ngodmother transmuted their crazy vehicle for a golden coach, redolent of\r\nthe perfumes of fairy land, they had scarcely been aware of the change.\r\nTheir own hearts formed a more real fairy land, which accompanied them\r\nwhithersoever they went, and could as easily spread its enchantments\r\nover the shattered machine in which they now jumbled along, as amidst\r\nthe cloth of gold and marbles of an eastern palace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nFew people know how little is necessary to live.\r\nWhat is called or thought _hardship_ is nothing; _one_\r\nunhappy feeling is worse than a thousand years of it.\r\n\r\nLORD EDWARD FITZGERALD.\r\n\r\n\r\nUncertain what to do, Villiers had hastily determined that they should\r\ntake up their abode at a little inn near Brixton, to wait till Thursday.\r\nHe did not know the place except by having passed it, and observed a\r\nsmart landlady at the door; so he trusted that it would be neat and\r\nclean. There was nothing imposing in the apperance of the young pair and\r\ntheir hackney coach, accordingly there was no bustling civility\r\ndisplayed to receive them. However, when the fire was once lighted, the\r\nold-fashioned sofa drawn near, and dinner ordered, they sat together and\r\nfelt very happy; outcasts though they were, wanderers from civilized\r\nexistence, shut out, through poverty, from the refinements and gilt\r\nelegancies of life.\r\n\r\nOne only cloud there was, when Villiers asked his wife an explanation\r\nabout their resources, and inquired whence she expected to receive money\r\non the following day. Ethel explained. Villiers looked disturbed. There\r\nwas something almost of anger in his voice, when he said, \"And so,\r\nEthel, you feel no compunction in acting in exact opposition to my\r\nwishes, my principles, my resolves?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, dear Edward, what can principles have to do with borrowing a few\r\npounds from dear good Aunt Bessy? Besides, we can repay her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be assured that we shall,\" replied Villiers; \"and you will never again,\r\nI trust, behave so unjustly by me. There are certain things in which we\r\nmust judged and act for ourselves, and the question of money\r\ntransactions is one. I may suffer--and you, alas! may also, through\r\npoverty; though you have taken pains to persuade me, that you do not\r\nfeel that struggles, which, for your sake chiefly, embitter my\r\nexistence. Yet they are nothing in comparison with the loss of my\r\nindependence--the sense of obligation--the knowledge that my kind\r\nfriends can talk over my affairs, take me to task, and call me a burthen\r\nto them. Why am I as I am? I have friends and connexions who would\r\nreadily assist me at this extremity, if I asked it, and I might turn\r\ntheir kind feelings into sterling gold if I would; but I have no desire\r\nto work this transmutation--I prefer their friendship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean,\" inquired his wife, \"that your friends would not love you\r\nthe better for having been of service to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"If they could serve me without annoyance to themselves they might; but\r\nhigh in rank and wealthy as many of my relations are, there is not one\r\namong them, at least of those to whom I could have recourse, who do not\r\ndispose of their resources to the uttermost shilling, in their own way.\r\nI then come to interfere with and to disarrange their plans; at first,\r\nthis might not be much--but presently they would weigh me against the\r\ngold I needed, and it might happen, that my scale would kick the beam.\r\n\r\n\"I speak for myself not for others; I may be too proud, too\r\nsensitive--but so I am. Ever since I knew what pecuniary obligations\r\nwere, I resolved to lay under such to no man, and this resolve was\r\nstronger than my love for you; judge therefore of its force, and the\r\nviolence you do me, when you would oblige me to act against it. Did I\r\nbegin to borrow, a train of thoughts would enter the lender's mind; the\r\nconsciousness of which, would haunt me like a crime. My actions would be\r\nscanned--I should be blamed for this, rebuked for that--even your name,\r\nmy Ethel, which I would place, like a star in the sky, far above their\r\nmathematical measurements, would become stale in their mouths, and the\r\npropriety of our marriage canvassed: could you bear that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I yield to all you say,\" she answered; \"yet this is strange morality.\r\nAre generosity, benevolence, and gratitude, to be exploded among us? Is\r\njustice, which orders that the rich give of his superfluity to the poor,\r\nto be banished from the world?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are eloquent,\" said Villiers; \"but, my little wild American, this\r\nis philosophy for the back-woods only. We have got beyond the primeval\r\nsimplicity of barter and exchange among gentlemen; and it is such if I\r\ngive gratitude in return for fifty pounds: by-and-by my fellow-trader\r\nmay grumble at the bargain. All this will become very clear to you\r\nhereafter, I fear--when knowledge of the world teaches you what sordid\r\nknaves we all are; it is to prevent your learning this lesson in a\r\npainful way, that I guard you so jealously from making a wrong step at\r\nthis crisis.\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak of dreams,\" said Ethel, \"as if dear aunt Bessy would feel any\r\nthing but pleasure in sending her mite to her own dear niece.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have told you what I wish,\" replied her husband, \"my honour is in\r\nyour hands; and I implore you, on this point, to preserve it in the way\r\nI desire. There is but one relationship that authorizes any thing like\r\ncommunity of goods, it is that of parent and child; but we are orphans,\r\ndearest--step-children, who are not permitted to foster our filial\r\nsentiments. My father is unworthy of his name--the animal who destroys\r\nits offspring at its birth is merciful in comparison with him: had he\r\ncast me off at once, I should have hardened my hands with labour, and\r\nearned my daily bread; but I was trained to \"high-born necessities,\" and\r\nhave all the \"wide wants and narrow powers\"[1] of the heir of wealth. But\r\nlet us dismiss this ungrateful subject. I never willingly advert, even\r\nin my own mind, to my father's unpaternal conduct. Let us instead fancy,\r\nsweet love, that we were born to what we have--that we are cottagers,\r\nthe children of mechanics, or wanderers in a barbarous country, where\r\nmoney is not; and imagine that this repose, this cheerful fire, this\r\nshelter from the pelting snow without, is an unexpected blessing. Strip\r\na man bare to what nature made him, and place him here, and what a hoard\r\nof luxury and wealth would not this room contain! In the Illinois, love,\r\nfew mansions could compete with this.\"\r\n\r\nThis was speaking in a language which Ethel could easily comprehend; she\r\nhad several times wished to express this very idea, but she feared to\r\nhurt the refined and exclusive feelings of her husband. A splendid\r\ndwelling, costly living, and many attendants, were with her the\r\nadjuncts, not the material, of life. If the stage on which she played\r\nher part was to be so decorated, it was well; if otherwise, the change\r\ndid not merit her attention. Love scoffed at such idle trappings, and\r\ncould build his tent of canvas, and sleep close nestled in her heart as\r\nsoftly, being only the more lovely and the more true, from the absence\r\nof every meretricious ornament.\r\n\r\nThis was another of Ethel's happy evenings, when she felt drawn close to\r\nhim she loved, and found elysium in the intimate union of their\r\nthoughts. The dusky room showed them but half to each other; and the\r\nlooks of each, beaming with tenderness, drank life from one another's\r\ngaze. The soft shadows thrown on their countenances, gave a lamp-like\r\nlustre to their eyes, in which the purest spirit of affection sat,\r\nweaving such unity of sentiment, such strong bonds of attachment, as\r\nmade all life dwindle to a point, and freighted the passing minute with\r\nthe hopes and fears of their entire existence. Not much was said, and\r\ntheir words were childish--words\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellette dar loro soli ambedui,\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich a listener would have judged to be meaningless. But the mystery of\r\nlove gave a deep sense to each syllable. The hours flew lightly away. There\r\nwas nothing to interrupt, nothing to disturb. Night came and the day was\r\nat an end; but Ethel looked forward to the next, with faith in its equal\r\nfelicity, and did not regret the fleet passage of time.\r\n\r\nThey had been asked during the evening if they were going by any early\r\ncoach on the following morning, and a simple negative was given. On that\r\nmorning they sat at their breakfast, with some diminution of the\r\nsanguine hopes of the previous evening. For morning is the time for\r\naction, of looking forward, of expectation,--and they must spend this in\r\nwaiting, cooped up in a little room, overlooking no cheering scene. A\r\nhigh road, thickly covered with snow, on which various vehicles were\r\nperpetually passing, was immediately before them. Opposite was a row of\r\nmean-looking houses, between which might be distinguished low fields\r\nburied in snow; and the dreary dark-looking sky bending over all, added\r\nto the forlorn aspect of nature. Villiers was very impatient to get\r\naway, yet another day must be passed here, and there was no help.\r\n\r\nOn the breakfast-table the waiter had placed the bill of the previous\r\nday; it remained unnoticed, and he left it on the table when the things\r\nwere taken away. \"I wonder when Fanny will come,\" said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not at all to-day,\" observed Villiers, \"she knows that we\r\nintend to remain till tomorrow here; and if your aunt's letter is\r\ndelayed till then, I see no chance of her coming, nor any use in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Aunt Bessy will not delay; her answer is certain of arriving this\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you imagine, love. You know little of the various chances that wait\r\nupon borrowing.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after, unable to bear confinement to the house, uneasy in his\r\nthoughts, and desirous a little to dissipate them by exercise, Villiers\r\nwent out. Ethel, taking a small Shakspeare, which her husband had had\r\nwith him at the coffee-house, occupied herself by reading, or turning\r\nfrom the written page to her own thoughts, gave herself up to reverie,\r\ndwelling on many an evanescent idea, and reverting delightedly to many\r\nscenes, which her memory recalled. She was one of those who \"know the\r\npleasures of solitude, when we hold commune alone with the tranquil\r\nsolemnity of nature.\" The thought of her father, of the Illinois, and\r\nthe measureless forest rose before her, and in her ear was the dashing\r\nof the stream which flowed near their abode. Her light feet again\r\ncrossed the prairie, and a thousand appearances of sky and earth\r\ndeparted for ever, were retraced in her brain. \"Would not Edward be\r\nhappy there?\" she thought: \"why should we not go? We should miss dear\r\nHoratio; but what else could we regret that we leave behind? and perhaps\r\nhe would join us, and then we should be quite happy.\" And then her fancy\r\npictured her new home and all its delights, till her eyes were suffused\r\nwith tender feeling, as her imagination sketched a variety of\r\nscenes--the pleasant labours of cultivation, the rides, the hunting, the\r\nboating, all common-place occurrences, which, attended on by love, were\r\nexalted into a perpetual gorgeous procession of beatified hours. And\r\nthen again she allowed to herself that Europe or America could contain\r\nthe same delights. She recollected Italy, and her feelings grew more\r\nsolemn and blissful as she meditated on the wondrous beauty and\r\nchangeful but deep interest of that land of memory.\r\n\r\nVilliers did not return for some hours;--he also had indulged in\r\nreverie--long-drawn, but not quite so pleasant as that of his\r\ninexperienced wife. The realities of life were kneaded up too entirely\r\nwith his prospects and schemes, for them to assume the fairy hues that\r\nadorned Ethel's. He could not see the end to his present struggle for\r\nthe narrowest independence. Very slender hopes had been held out to him;\r\nand thus he was to drag out an embittered existence, spent upon sordid\r\ncares, till his father died--an ungrateful idea, from which he turned\r\nwith a sigh. He walked speedily, on account of the cold; and as his\r\nblood began to circulate more cheerily in his frame, a change came over\r\nthe tenor of his thoughts. From the midst of the desolation in which he\r\nwas lost, a vision of happiness arose, that forced itself on his\r\nspeculations, in spite, as he imagined, of his better reason. The image\r\nof an elegant home, here or in Italy, adorned by Ethel--cheered by the\r\npresence of friends, unshadowed by any cares, presented itself to his\r\nmind with strange distinctness and pertinacity. At no time had Villiers\r\nloved so passionately as now. The difficulties of their situation had\r\nexalted her, who shared them with such cheerful fortitude, into an angel\r\nof consolation. The pride of man in possessing the affections of this\r\nlovely and noble-minded creature, was blended with the tenderest desire\r\nof protecting and serving her. His heart glowed with honest joy at the\r\nreflection that her happiness depended upon him solely, and that he was\r\nready to devote his life to secure it. Was there any action too arduous,\r\nany care too minute, to display his gratitude and his perfect affection?\r\nAs his recollection came back, he found that he was at a considerable\r\ndistance from her, so he swiftly turned his steps homeward, (that was\r\nhis home where she was,) and scarcely felt that he trod earth as he\r\nrecollected that each moment carried him nearer, and that he should soon\r\nmeet the fond gaze of the kindest, sweetest eyes in the world.\r\n\r\nThus they met, with a renewed joy, after a short absence, each reaping,\r\nfrom their separate meditations, a fresh harvest of loving thoughts and\r\ninterchange of grateful emotion. Great was the pity that such was their\r\nsituation--that circumstances, all mean and trivial, drew them from\r\ntheir heaven-high elevation, to the more sordid cares of this dirty\r\nplanet. Yet why name it pity? their pure natures could turn the\r\ngrovelling substance presented to them, to ambrosial food for the\r\nsustenance of love.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Cenci.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's a bliss beyond all that the minstrel has told,\r\nWhen two that are linked in one heavenly tie,\r\nWith heart never changing, and brow never cold,\r\nLove on through all ills, and love on till they die.\r\n\r\nLALLA ROOKH.\r\n\r\n\r\nVilliers had not been returned long, when the waiter came in, and\r\ninformed them, that his mistress declined serving their dinner, till her\r\nbill of the morning was paid; and then he left the room. The gentle pair\r\nlooked at each other, and laughed. \"We must wait till Fanny comes, I\r\nfear,\" said Ethel; \"for my purse is literally empty.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if Miss Derham should not come?\" remarked Villiers.\r\n\r\n\"But she will!--she has delayed, but I am perfectly certain that she\r\nwill come in the course of the day: I do not feel the least doubt about\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nTo quicken the passage of time, Ethel employed herself in netting a\r\npurse, (the inutility of which Villiers smilingly remarked,) while her\r\nhusband read to her some of the scenes from Shakspeare's play of\r\n\"Troilus and Cressida.\" The profound philosophy, and intense passion, of\r\nthis drama, adorned by the most magnificent poetry that can even be\r\nfound in the pages of this prince of poets, caused each to hang\r\nattentive and delighted upon their occupation. As it grew dark, Villiers\r\nstirred up the fire, and still went on; till having with difficulty\r\ndecyphered the lines--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"She was beloved--she loved;--she is, and doth;\r\nBut still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth,\"--\r\n\r\n\r\nhe closed the books. \"It is in vain,\" he said; \"our liberator does\r\nnot come; and these churls will not give us lights.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is early yet, dearest,\" replied Ethel;--\"not yet four o'clock. Would\r\nTroilus and Cressida have repined at having been left darkling a few\r\nminutes? How much happier we are than all the heroes and heroines that\r\never lived or were imagined! they grasped at the mere shadow of the\r\nthing, whose substance we absolutely possess. Let us know and\r\nacknowledge our good fortune. God knows, I do, and am beyond words\r\ngrateful!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is much to be grateful for--sharing the fortunes of a ruined man!\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not speak as Troilus does,\" replied Ethel smiling: \"he knew\r\nbetter the worth of love compared with worldly trifles.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would have me protest, then,\" said Villiers;--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But, alas!\r\nI am as true as truth's simplicity,\r\nAnd simpler than the infancy of truth;\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"so that all I can say is, that you are a very ill-used little girl, to be\r\nmated as you are--so buried, with all your loveliness, in this\r\nobscurity--so bound, though akin to heaven, to the basest dross of\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are poetical, dearest, and I thank you. For my own part, I am in\r\nlove with ill luck. I do not think we should have discovered how very\r\ndear we are to each other, had we sailed for ever on a summer sea.\"\r\n\r\nSuch talk, a little prolonged, at length dwindled to silence. Edward\r\ndrew her nearer to him; and as his arm encircled her waist, she placed\r\nher sweet head on his bosom, and they remained in silent reverie. He, as\r\nwith his other hand he played with her shining ringlets, and parted them\r\non her fair brow, was disturbed in thought, and saddened by a sense of\r\ndegradation. Not to be able to defend the angelic creature, who depended\r\non him, from the world's insults, galled his soul, and embittered even\r\nthe heart's union that existed between them. She did not think--she did\r\nknow of these things. After many minutes of silence, she said,--\"I have\r\nbeen trying to discover why it is absolute pleasure to suffer pain for\r\nthose we love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pleasure in pain!--you speak riddles.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" she replied, raising her head; \"but I have divined this. The\r\ngreat pleasure of love is derived from sympathy--the feeling of\r\nunion--of unity. Any thing that makes us alive to the sense of\r\nlove--that imprints deeper on our plastic consciousness the knowledge of\r\nthe existence of our affection, causes an increase of happiness. There\r\nare two things to which we are most sensitive--pleasure and pain. But\r\nhabit can somewhat dull the first; and that which was in its newness,\r\necstasy--our being joined for ever--becomes, like the air we breathe, a\r\nthing we could not live without, but yet in which we are rather\r\npassively than actively happy. But when pain comes to awaken us to a\r\ntrue sense of how much we love--when we suffer for one another's dear\r\nsake--the consciousness of attachment swells our hearts: we are recalled\r\nfrom the forgetfulness engendered by custom; and the awakening and\r\nrenewal of the sense of affection brings with it a joy, that sweetens to\r\nits dregs the bitterest cup.\"\r\n\r\n\"Encourage this philosophy, dear Ethel,\" replied Villiers; \"you will\r\nneed it: but it shames me to think that I am your teacher in this\r\nmournful truth.\" As he spoke, his whole frame was agitated by tenderness\r\nand grief. Ethel could see, by the dull fire-light, a tear gather on his\r\neye-lashes: it fell upon her hand. She threw her arms round him, and\r\npressed him to her heart with a passionate gush of weeping, occasioned\r\npartly by remorse at having so moved him, and partly by her heart's\r\noverflowing with the dear security of being loved.\r\n\r\nThey had but a little recovered from this scene, when the waiter,\r\nbringing in lights, announced Miss Derham. Her coming had been full of\r\ndisasters. After many threatenings, and much time consumed in clumsy\r\nrepairs, her hackney-coach had fairly broken down: she had walked the\r\nrest of the way; but they were much further from town than she expected;\r\nand thus she accounted for her delay. She brought no news; but held in\r\nher hand the letter that contained the means of freeing them from their\r\nawkward predicament.\r\n\r\n\"We will not stay another minute in this cursed place,\" said Villiers:\r\n\"we will go immediately to Salt Hill, where I intended to take you\r\nto-morrow. I can return by one of the many stages which pass\r\ncontinually, to keep my appointment with Gayland; and be back with you\r\nagain by night. So if these stupid people possess a post-chaise, we will\r\nbe gone directly.\"\r\n\r\nEthel was well pleased with this arrangement; and it was put it\r\nexecution immediately. The chaise and horses were easily procured. They\r\nset Fanny down in their way through town. Ethel tried to repay her\r\nkindness by heartfelt thanks; and she, in her placid way, showed clearly\r\nhow pleased she was to serve them.\r\n\r\nLeaving her in Piccadilly, not far from her own door, they pursued their\r\nway to Salt Hill; and it seemed as if, in this more change of place,\r\nthey had escaped from a kind of prison, to partake again in the\r\nimmunities and comforts of civilized life. Ethel was considerably\r\nfatigued when she arrived; and her husband feared that he had tasked her\r\nstrength too far. The falling and fallen snow clogged up the roads, and\r\ntheir journey had been long. She slept, indeed, the greater part of the\r\nway, her head resting on him; and her languor and physical suffering\r\nwere soothed by emotions the most balmy and by the gladdening sense of\r\nconfidence and security.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at Salt Hill late in the evening. The hours were precious;\r\nfor early on the following day, Villiers was obliged to return to town.\r\nOn inquiry, he found that his best mode was to go by a night-coach from\r\nBath, which would pass at seven in the morning. They were awake half the\r\nnight, talking of their hopes, their plans, their probable deliverance\r\nfrom their besetting annoyances. By this time Ethel had taught her own\r\nphraseology, and Villiers had learned to believe that whatever must\r\nhappen would fall upon both, and that no separation could take place\r\nfraught with any good to either.\r\n\r\nWhen Ethel awoke, late in the morning, Villiers was gone. Her watch told\r\nher, indeed, that it was near ten o'clock, and that he must have\r\ndeparted long before. She felt inclined to reproach him for leaving her,\r\nthough only for a few hours, without an interchange of adieu. In truth,\r\nshe was vexed that he was not there: the world appeared to her so blank,\r\nwithout his voice to welcome her back to it from out of the regions of\r\nsleep. While this slight cloud of ill-humour (may it be called?) was\r\npassing over her mind, she perceived a little note, left by her husband,\r\nlying on her pillow. Kissing it a thousand times, she read its contents,\r\nas if they possessed talismanic power. They breathed the most passionate\r\ntenderness: they besought her, as she loved him, to take care of\r\nherself, and to keep up her spirits until his return, which would be as\r\nspeedy as the dove flies back to its nest, where its sweet mate fondly\r\nexpects him. With these assurances and blessings to cheer her, Ethel\r\narose. The sun poured its wintry yet cheering beams into the parlour,\r\nand the sparkling, snow-clad earth glittered beneath. She wrapped\r\nherself in her cloak, and walked into the garden of the hotel. Long\r\nimmured in London, living as if its fogs were the universal vesture of\r\nall things, her spirits rose to exultation and delight, as she looked on\r\nthe blue sky spread cloudlessly around. As the pure breeze freshened her\r\ncheek, a kind of transport seized her; her spirit took wings; she felt\r\nas if she could float on the bosom of the air--as if there was a\r\nsympathy in nature, whose child and nursling she was, to welcome her\r\nback to her haunts, and to reward her bounteously for coming. The trees,\r\nall leafless and snow-bedecked, were friends and intimates: she kissed\r\ntheir rough barks, and then laughed at her own folly at being so rapt.\r\nThe snow-drop, as it peeped from the ground, was a thing of wonder and\r\nmystery; and the shapes of frost, beautiful forms to be worshipped. All\r\nsorrow--all care passed away, and left her mind as clear and bright as\r\nthe unclouded heavens that bent over her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nHerein\r\nShall my captivity be made my happiness;\r\nSince what I lose in freedom, I regain\r\nWith interest.\r\n\r\nBEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe glow of enthusiasm and gladness, thus kindled in her soul, faded\r\nslowly as the sun descended; and human tenderness returned in full tide\r\nupon her. She longed for Edward to speak to; when would he come back?\r\nShe walked a little way on the London road; she returned: still her\r\npatience was not exhausted. The sun's orb grew red and dusky as it\r\napproached the horizon: she returned to the house. It was yet early:\r\nEdward could not be expected yet: he had promised to come as soon as\r\npossible; but he had prepared her for the likelihood of his arrival only\r\nby the mail at night. It was long since she had written to Saville.\r\nCooped up in town, saddened by her separation from her husband, or\r\nenjoying the brief hours of reunion, she had felt disinclined to write.\r\nHer enlivened spirits now prompted her to pour out some of their\r\noverflowings to him. She did not allude to any of the circumstances of\r\ntheir situation, for Edward had forbidden that topic: still she had much\r\nto say; for her heart was full of benevolence to all mankind; besides\r\nher attachment to her husband, the prospect of becoming a mother within\r\na few months, opened another source of tenderness; there seemed to be a\r\nsuperabundance of happiness within her, a portion of which she desired\r\nto impart to those she loved.\r\n\r\nDaylight had long vanished, and Villiers did not return. She felt\r\nuneasy:--of course he would come by the mail; yet if he should not--what\r\ncould prevent him? Conjectures would force themselves on her,\r\nunreasonable, she told herself; yet her doubts were painful, and she\r\nlistened attentively each time that the sound of wheels grew, and again\r\nfaded, upon her ear. If the vehicle stopped, she was in a state of\r\nexcitation that approached alarm. She knew not what she feared; yet her\r\ndisquiet increased into anxiety. \"Shall I ever see him again?\" were\r\nwords that her lips did not utter, and yet which lingered in her heart,\r\nalthough unaccompanied by any precise idea to her understanding.\r\n\r\nShe had given a thousand messages to the servants;--and at last the mail\r\narrived. She heard a step--it was the waiter:--\"The gentleman is not\r\ncome, ma'am,\" he said. \"I knew it,\" she thought;--\"yet why? why?\" At one\r\ntime she resolved to set off for town; yet whither to go--where to find\r\nhim? An idea struck her, that he had missed the mail; but as he would\r\nnot leave her a prey to uncertainty, he would come by some other\r\nconveyance. She got a little comfort from this notion, and resumed her\r\noccupation of waiting; though the vagueness of her expectations rendered\r\nher a thousand times more restless than before. And all was vain. The\r\nmail had arrived at eleven o'clock--at twelve she retired to her room.\r\nShe read again and again his note: his injunction, that she should take\r\ncare of herself, induced her to go to bed at a little after one; but\r\nsleep was still far from her. Till she could no longer expect--till it\r\nbecame certain that it must be morning before he could come, she did not\r\nclose her eyes. As her last hope quitted her, she wept bitterly. Where\r\nwas the joyousness of the morning?--the exuberant delight with which her\r\nveins had tingled, which had painted life as a blessing? She hid her\r\nface in her pillow, and gave herself up to tears, till sleep at last\r\nstole over her senses.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning her door opened and her curtain was drawn aside.\r\nShe awoke immediately, and saw Fanny Derham standing at her bed-side.\r\n\r\n\"Edward! where is he?\" she exclaimed, starting up.\r\n\r\n\"Well, quite well,\" replied Fanny: \"do not alarm yourself, dear Mrs.\r\nVilliers,--he has been arrested.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must go to him immediately. Leave me for a little while, dear\r\nFanny,--I will dress and come to you; do you order the chaise meanwhile.\r\nI can hear every thing as we are going to town.\"\r\n\r\nEthel trembled violently--her speech was rapid but inarticulate; the\r\npaleness that overspread her face, blanching even her marble brow, and\r\nthe sudden contraction of her features, alarmed Fanny. The words she had\r\nused in communicating her intelligence were cabalistic to Ethel, and her\r\nfears were the more intolerable because mysterious and undefined; the\r\nblood trickled cold in her veins, and a chilly moisture stood on her\r\nforehead. She exerted herself violently to conquer this weakness, but it\r\nshackled her powers, as bands of rope would her limbs, and after a few\r\nmoments she sank back on her pillow almost bereft of life. Fanny sprang\r\nto the bell, then sprinkled her with water; some salts were procured\r\nfrom the landlady, and gradually the colour revisited her cheeks, and\r\nher frame resumed its functions--an hysteric fit, the first she had ever\r\nhad, left her at last exhausted but more composed. She herself became\r\nfrightened lest illness should keep her from Villiers; she exerted\r\nherself to become tranquil, and lay for some time without speaking or\r\nmoving. A little refreshment contributed to restore her, and she turned\r\nto Fanny with a faint sweet smile, \"You see,\" said she, \"what a weak,\r\nfoolish thing I am; but I am well now, quite rallied--there must be no\r\nmore delay.\"\r\n\r\nHer cheerful voice and lively manner gave her friend confidence. Fanny\r\nwas one who believed much in the mastery of mind, and felt sure that\r\nnothing would be so prejudicial to Mrs. Villiers as contradiction, and\r\nobstacles put in the way of her attaining the object of her wishes. In\r\nspite therefore of the good people about, who insisted that the most\r\ndisastrous consequences would ensue, she ordered the horses, and\r\nprepared for their immediate journey to town. Ethel repaid her cares\r\nwith smiles, while she restrained her curiosity, laid as it were a check\r\non her too impatient movements, and forced a calm of manner which gave\r\nher friend courage to proceed.\r\n\r\nIt was not until they were on their way that the object of their journey\r\nwas mentioned. Fanny then spoke of the arrest as a trifling\r\ncircumstance--mentioned bail, and twenty things, which Ethel only\r\ncomprehended to be mysterious methods of setting him free; and then also\r\nshe asked the history of what had happened. The tale was soon told. The\r\nmoment Mr. Villiers had entered Piccadilly he had caused a coach to be\r\ncalled, but on passing to it from the stage, two men entered it with\r\nhim, whose errand was too easily explained. He had driven first to his\r\nsolicitor's, hoping to put every thing in train for his instant\r\nliberation. The day was consumed in these fruitless endeavours--he did\r\nnot give up hope till past ten at night, when he sent to Fanny, asking\r\nher to go down to Mrs. Villiers as early as possible in the morning, and\r\nto bring her up to town. His wish was, he said, that Ethel should take\r\nup her abode at Mrs. Derham's till this affair could be arranged, and\r\nthey were enabled to leave London. His note was hurried; he promised\r\nthat another, more explicit, should await his wife on her arrival.\r\n\r\n\"You will tell the driver,\" said Ethel, when this story was finished,\r\n\"to drive to Edward's prison. I would not stay away five minutes from\r\nhim in his present situation to purchase the universe.\"\r\n\r\nAny one but Miss Derham might have resisted Ethel's wish--have argued\r\nwith her, and irritated her by the display of obstacles and\r\ninconveniences. It was not Fanny's method ever to oppose the desires of\r\nothers. They knew best, she affirmed, their own sensations, and what was\r\nmost fitting for them. What is best for me, habit, education, and a\r\ndifferent texture of character, may render the worst for them. In the\r\npresent instance, also, she saw that Ethel's feelings were almost too\r\nhigh wrought for her strength--that opposition, by making a further call\r\non her powers, might upset them wholly. She had besides, the deepest\r\nrespect for her attachment to her husband, and was willing to reward it\r\nby bringing her to him without delay. Having thus fortunately fallen\r\ninto reasonable hands, guided by one who could understand her character,\r\nand not torture her by forcing notions the opposite of those on which\r\nshe felt herself compelled to act, Ethel became tranquil, and saw the\r\nmere panic of inexperience in her previous excessive alarm.\r\n\r\nThey now approached London. Fanny called the post-boy to the window of\r\nthe chaise, and gave him directions, at which he a little stared, but\r\nsaid nothing. She gave things their own names, and never dreamt of\r\nsaving appearances, as it is called. What ought to be done, that she\r\ndared do in the face of the whole world, and therefore to make a mystery\r\nof their destination never once occurred to her. They drove through the\r\nlong interminable suburbs--through Piccadilly and the Strand. Ethel's\r\ncheeks flushed with the excitement, and something like apprehension made\r\nher heart flutter. She had endeavoured to form an image in her own mind\r\nof whither they were going--it was vague and therefore frightful--but\r\nEdward was there, and she also would share the horrors of his\r\nprison-house.\r\n\r\nThey passed through Temple Bar, and going down an obscure street or two,\r\nstopped at a dingy door-way. \"This is not right,\" said Ethel, almost\r\ngasping for breath, \"this is not a prison.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something very like it, as you will find too soon,\" said her friend.\r\n\r\nStill Ethel's imagination was relieved by the absence of the massy\r\nwalls, the portentous gates, the gloomy immensity of an absolute prison.\r\nThe door of the house being opened, Ethel stepped out from the chaise\r\nand asked for Mr. Villiers. The man whom she addressed hesitated, but\r\nEthel had learnt one only worldly lesson, which was, whenever she needed\r\nthe services of people of the lower orders, to disseminate money\r\nplentifully. Her purse was in her hand, and she gave a sovereign to the\r\nman, who then at once showed them upstairs; which she ascended, though\r\nevery limb nearly refused to perform its office as she approached the\r\nspot where again she was to find--to see him, whose image lived\r\neternally in her heart, and whom it was the sole joy of her life to wait\r\non, to be sheltered by, to live near.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened. In the dingy, dusty room, beside the fire, which\r\nlooked as if it could not burn, and was never meant to warm even the\r\nblack neglected grate, Villiers sat, reading. His first emotion was\r\nshame when he saw Ethel enter. There was no accord between her spotless\r\nloveliness and his squalid prison-room. Any one who has seen a sunbeam\r\nsuddenly enter and light up a scene of housewifely neglect, and vulgar\r\ndiscomfort, and felt how obtrusive it rendered all that might be\r\nhalf-forgotten in the shade, can picture how the simple elegance of\r\nEthel displayed yet more distinctly to her husband the worse than\r\nbeggarly scene in which she found him. His cheeks flushed, and almost he\r\nwould have turned away. He would have reproached, but a tenderness and\r\nan elevation of feeling animated her expressive countenance, which\r\nturned the current of his thoughts. Whether it were their fate to suffer\r\nthe extremes of fortune in the savage wilderness, or in the more\r\nappalling privations of civilized life--love, and the poetry of love\r\naccompanied her, and gilded, and irradiated the commonest forms of\r\npenury. She looked at him, and her eyes then glanced to the barred\r\nwindows. As Fanny and their conductor left them, she heard the key turn\r\nin the lock with an impertinent intrusive loudness. She felt pained for\r\nhim, but for herself it was as if the world and all its cares were\r\nlocked out, and as if in this near association with him, she reaped the\r\nreward of all her previous anxiety. There was no repining in her\r\nthoughts, no dejection in her manner; Villiers could read in her open\r\ncountenance, as plainly as through the clearest crystal, the sentiments\r\nthat were passing in her mind--it was something more satisfied than\r\nresignation, more contented than fortitude. It was a knowledge that\r\nwhatever evil might attend her lot, the good so far outweighed it, that,\r\nfor his sake only, could she advert to any feeling of distress. It was a\r\nconsciousness of being in her place, and of fulfilling her duty,\r\naccompanied by a sort of rapture in remembering how thrice dear and\r\nhallowed that duty was. Angels could not feel as she did, for they\r\ncannot sacrifice to those they love; yet there was in her that absence\r\nof all self-emanating pain, which is the characteristic of what we are\r\ntold of the angelic essences.\r\n\r\nAs when at night autumnal winds are howling, and vast masses of winged\r\nclouds are driven with indescribable speed across the sky--we note the\r\nislands of dark ether, built round by the white fleecy shapes; and as we\r\nmark the stars which gem their unfathomable depth, silence and sublime\r\ntranquillity appear to have found a home in that deep vault, and we love\r\nto dwell on the peace and beauty that live there, while the clouds still\r\nrush on, and the face of the lower heaven is more mutable than water.\r\nThus the mind of Ethel, surrounded by the world's worst forms of\r\nadversity, showed clear and serene, entirely possessed by the repose of\r\nlove. It was impossible but that, in spite of shame and regret, Villiers\r\nshould not participate in these feelings. He gave himself up to the\r\nsoftening influence: he knew not how to repine on his own account;\r\nEthel's affection demanded to stand in place of prosperity, and he could\r\nnot refuse to admit so dear a claim.\r\n\r\nThe door had closed on them, and every outlet to liberty, or the\r\nenjoyment of life, was barred up. Edward drew Ethel towards him and\r\nkissed her fondly. Their eyes met, and the speechless tenderness that\r\nbeamed from hers reached his heart and soothed every ruffled feeling.\r\nSitting together, and interchanging a few words of comfort and hope,\r\nmingled with kind looks and affectionate caresses, they neither of them\r\nremembered indignity nor privation. The tedious mechanism of civilized\r\nlife, and the odious interference of their fellow-creatures were\r\nforgotten, and they were happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nVeggo pur troppo\r\nChe favola \u00e8 la vita,\r\nE la favola mia non \u00e8 compita.\r\n\r\nPETRARCA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe darker months of winter had passed away, and the chilly, blighting\r\nEnglish spring begun. Towards the end of March Lady Lodore came to town.\r\nShe had long ago, in her days of wealth, fitted up a house in Park Lane, so\r\nshe returned to it, as to a home--if home it might be called--where no\r\none welcomed her--where none sat beside her at the domestic hearth.\r\n\r\nFor the first time she felt keenly this circumstance. During her\r\nmother's lifetime she had had her constantly for a companion, and\r\nafterwards as events pressed upon her, and while the anguish she felt\r\nupon Horatio Saville's marriage was still fresh, she had not reverted to\r\nher lonely position as the source of pain.\r\n\r\nThe haughty, the firm, the self-exalting soul of Cornelia had borne up\r\nlong. She had often felt that she walked on the borders of a precipice,\r\nand that if once she admitted sentiments of regret, she should plunge\r\nwithout retrieve into a gulph, dark, portentous, inextricable. She had\r\noften repeated to herself that fate should not vanquish her, and that in\r\nspite of despair she would be happy: it is true that the misery\r\noccasioned by Saville's marriage was a canker at her heart, for which\r\nthere was no cure, but she had recourse to dissipation that she might\r\nendeavour to forget it. A sad and ineffectual remedy. She was surrounded\r\nby admirers, whom she disdained, and by friends to whom she would have\r\ndied rather than betray the naked misery of her soul. She had never\r\nplanned nor thought of marriage. The report concerning the Earl of\r\nD----was one of those which the world always makes current, when two\r\npersons of opposite sexes are, by any chance, thrown much together. His\r\nsister was Lady Lodore's friend, and she had chaperoned her, and been of\r\nassistance to her, during the courtship of the gentleman who was at\r\npresent her husband. It was their house that Lady Lodore had just\r\nquitted on arriving in town. The new-born happiness of early wedded life\r\nhad been a scene to call her back to thoughts which were the sources of\r\nthe bitterest anguish. She abhorred herself that she could envy, that\r\nshe could desire to exchange places with, any created being. She\r\nabridged her visit, and fancied that she should regain peace in the\r\nindependence of her own home. But the enjoyment of liberty was cold in\r\nher heart, and loneliness added a freezing chilliness to her feeling.\r\n\r\nThe mind of Cornelia was much above the world she lived in, though she\r\nhad sacrificed all to it; and, so to speak, much above herself. Take\r\npride from her, and there was understanding, magnanimity, and great\r\nkindliness of disposition: but pride had been the wall of China to shut\r\nup all her better qualities, and to keep them from communicating with\r\nthe world beyond;--pride, which grew strong by resistance, and towered\r\nabove every aggressor;--pride, which crumbled away, when time and change\r\nwere its sole assailants, till her inner being was left unprotected and\r\nbare.\r\n\r\nShe found herself alone in the world. She felt that her life was\r\naimless, unprofitable, blank. She was humiliated and saddened by her\r\nrelative position in the world. She did not think of her daughter as a\r\nresource; she was in the hands of her enemies, and no hope lay there.\r\nShe entertained the belief that Mrs. Villiers was weak both in character\r\nand understanding; and that to make any attempt to interest herself in\r\nher, would end in disappointment, if not disgust. Imagining, as we are\r\nall apt to do, how we should act in another person's place, she had\r\nformed a notion of what she would have done, had she been Ethel; and as\r\nnothing was done, she almost despised, and quite pitied her. No! there\r\nwas no help. She was alone;--none loved, none cared for her; and the\r\nflower of the field, which a child plucks and wears for an hour, and\r\nthen casts aside, was of more worth than she.\r\n\r\nEvery amusement grew tedious--all society vacant and dull. When she came\r\nback from dinners or assemblies, to her luxurious but empty abode, the\r\ndarkest thoughts, engendered by spleen, hung over its threshold, and\r\nwelcomed her return. At such times, she would dismiss her attendant, and\r\nremain half the night by her fireside, encouraging sickly reveries,\r\nstruggling with the fate that bound her, yet unable in any way to make\r\nan effort for freedom.\r\n\r\n\"Time\"--thus would her thoughts fashion themselves--\"yes, time rolls on,\r\nand what does it bring? I live in a desert; its barren sands feed my\r\nhour-glass, and they come out fruitless as they went in. Months change\r\ntheir names--years their cyphers: my brow is sadly trenched; the bloom\r\nof youth is faded: my mind gathers wrinkles. What will become of me?\r\n\r\n\"Hopes of my youth, where are ye?--my aspirations, my pride, my belief\r\nthat I could grasp and possess all things? Alas! there is nothing of all\r\nthis! My soul lies in the dust; and I look up to know that I have been\r\nplaying with shadows, and that I am fallen for ever! What do I see\r\naround me? The tide of life is ebbing fast! I had fancied that pearls\r\nand gold would have been left by the retiring waves; and I find only\r\nbarren, lonely sands! No voice reaches me from across the waters--no one\r\nstands beside me on the shore! Would--O would I could lay my head on the\r\nspray-sprinkled beach, and sleep for ever!\r\n\r\n\"This is madness!--these incoherent images that throng my brain are the\r\nravings of insanity!--yet what greater madness, than to know that love,\r\naffection, the charities of life, the hopes of existence, are empty\r\nwords for me. Am I indeed to have done with these? What is it that still\r\nmoves up and down in my soul, making me feel as if something might yet\r\nbe accomplished? Is it that the ardour of youth is not yet tamed? Alas!\r\nmy youth has departed for ever. Yet wherefore these sighs, which wrap an\r\neternity of wretchedness in their evanescent breath?--why these tears,\r\nthat, flowing from the inmost fountains of the soul, endeavour to give\r\npassage to the flood of sorrow that deluges and overwhelms it? The\r\nhusband of my youth!--the thought of him passes like a shadow across me!\r\nHad he borne with me a little longer--had I submitted to his\r\ncontroul--how different my destiny had been! But I will not think of\r\nthat--I do not! A mightier storm than any he could raise has swept\r\nacross me since, and laid all waste. My soul has been set upon a hope,\r\nwhich has vanished, and desolation has come in its room. Could God, in\r\nhis anger, bestow a bitterer curse on a condemned spirit, than that\r\nwhich weighs on me, when I reflect, that through my own fault I lost\r\nhim, whom but to see was paradise? The thought haunts me like a crime;\r\nyet when is it absent from me?--it sleeps with me, rises with me--it is\r\nby me now, and I would willingly die only to dismiss it for ever.\r\n\r\n\"Miserable Cornelia! Thou hast been courted, lauded, waited on,\r\nloved!--it is all over! I am alone! My poor, poor mother!--my much\r\nreviled, my dearest mother!--by you, at least, I was valued! Ah! why are\r\nyou gone, leaving your wretched child alone?\r\n\r\n\"O that I could take wings and rise from out of the abyss into which I\r\nam fallen! Can I not, myself being miserable, take pleasure in the\r\npleasure of others; and by force of strong sympathy, forget my selfish\r\nwoes? With whom can I sympathize? None desire my care, and all would\r\nrepay my officiousness with ingratitude, perhaps with scorn. Once I\r\ncould assist the poor; now I am poor myself: my limited means scarce\r\nsuffice to keep me in that station in society, from which, did I once\r\ndescend, I were indeed trampled upon and destroyed for ever. Tears rush\r\nfrom my eyes--my heart sinks within me, as I look forward. Again the\r\nsame cares, the same coil, the same bitter result. Hopes held out, only\r\nto be crushed; affections excited, only to be scattered to the winds. I\r\nblamed myself for struggling too much with fate, for rowing against wind\r\nand tide, for resolving to controul the events that form existence: now\r\nI yield--I have long yielded--I have let myself drift, as I hoped, into\r\na quiet creek, where indifference and peace ruled the hour; and lo! it\r\nis a whirlpool, to swallow all I had left of enjoyment upon earth!\"\r\n\r\nIt was not until she had exhausted herself by these gloomy and restless\r\nreflections, that she laid her head upon her pillow, and tried to sleep.\r\nMorning usually dawned before she closed her eyes; and it was nearly\r\nnoon before she rose, weary and unrefreshed. It was with a struggle that\r\nshe commenced a new day--a day that was to be cheered by no event nor\r\nfeeling capable of animating her to any sense of joy. She had never\r\noccupied herself by intellectual exertion: her employments had been the\r\ncultivation of what are called accomplishments merely; and when now she\r\nreverted to these, it was with bitterness. She remembered the interval\r\nwhen she had been inspirited by the delightful wish to please Horatio.\r\nNow none cared how the forlorn Cornelia passed her time;--no one would\r\nhang enraptured on her voice, or hail with gladness the developement of\r\nsome new talent. \"It is the same,\" she thought, \"how I get rid of the\r\nheavy hours, so that they go. I have but to give myself up to the\r\nsluggish stream that bears me on to old age, not more bereft or\r\nunregarded than these wretched years.\"\r\n\r\nThus she lingered idly through the morning; her only enjoyment being,\r\nwhen she secured to herself a solitary drive, and reclining back in her\r\ncarriage, felt herself safe from every intrusion, and yet enjoying a\r\nsuccession of objects, that a little varied the tenor of her thoughts.\r\nShe had deserted the park, and sought unfrequented drives in the\r\nenvirons of London. Evening at last came, and with it her uninteresting\r\nengagements, which yet she found better than entire seclusion. Forced to\r\nrouse herself to adopt, as a mask, the smiling appearance which had been\r\nnatural to her for many years, she often abhorred every one around her;\r\nand yet, hating herself more, took refuge among them, from her own\r\nsociety. Her chief care was to repress any manifestation of her despair,\r\nwhich too readily rose to her lips or in her eyes. The glorious hues of\r\nsunset--the subduing sounds of music--even the sight of a beautiful\r\ngirl, resplendent with happiness and youth, moving gracefully in\r\ndance--had power to move her to tears: her blood seemed to curdle and\r\ngrow thick, while gloomy shadows mantled over her features. Often, she\r\ncould scarcely forbear expressing the bitterness of her feelings, and\r\nindulging in acrimonious remarks on the deceits of life, and the inanity\r\nof all things. It seemed to her, sometimes, that she must die if she did\r\nnot give vent to the still increasing horror with which she regarded the\r\nwhole system of the world.\r\n\r\nNor were her sufferings always thus negative. One evening, especially, a\r\nyoung travelled gentleman approached her, with all the satisfaction\r\npainted on his countenance, which he felt at having secured a topic for\r\nthe entertainment of the fashionable Lady Lodore.\r\n\r\n\"You are intimate with the Misses Saville,\" he said; \"what charming\r\ngirls they are! I have just left them at Naples, where they have been\r\nspending the carnival. I saw them almost every day, and capitally we\r\nenjoyed ourselves. Their Italian sister-in-law spirited them up to mask,\r\nand to make a real carnival of it. A most lovely woman that. Did you\r\never see Mrs. Saville, Lady Lodore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" replied his auditress.\r\n\r\n\"Such eyes! Gazelles, and stars, and suns, and the whole range of poetic\r\nimagery, might be sought in vain, to do justice to her large dark eyes.\r\nShe is very young--scarcely twenty: and to see her with her child, is\r\npositively a finer tableau than any Raphael or Correggio in the world.\r\nShe has a little girl, not a year old, with golden hair, and eyes as\r\nblack as the mother's--the most beautiful little thing, and so\r\nintelligent. Saville doats on it: no wonder--he is not himself handsome,\r\nyou know; though the lovely Clorinda would stab me if she heard me say\r\nso. She positively adores him. You should have seen them together.\"\r\n\r\nLady Lodore turned on him one of her sweetest smiles, and in her blandest\r\ntone, said, \"If you could only get me an ice from that servant, who I see\r\nimmovable behind those dear, wonderful dowagers, you would so oblige\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nHe was gone in a minute; and on his return, Lady Lodore was so deeply\r\nengrossed in being persuaded to go to the next drawing room, by the young\r\nand new-married Countess of G--, that she could only reward him with\r\nanother heavenly smile. He was obliged to take his carnival at Naples to\r\nsome other listener.\r\n\r\nCornelia scarcely closed her eyes that night. The thought of the happy\r\nwife and lovely child of Saville, pierced her as with remorse. She had\r\nentirely broken off her acquaintance with his family, so that she was\r\nignorant of Clorinda's disposition, and readily fancied that she was as\r\nhappy as she believed that the wife of Horatio Saville must be. She\r\nwould not acknowledge that she was wicked enough to repine at her\r\nfelicity; but that he should be rendered happy by any other woman than\r\nherself--that any other woman should have become the sharer of his\r\ndearest affections, stung her to the core. Yet why should she regret?\r\nShe were well exchanged for one so lovely and so young. At the age of\r\nthirty-four, which she had now reached, Cornelia persuaded herself, that\r\nthe name of beauty was a mockery as applied to her--though her own glass\r\nmight have told her otherwise; for time had dealt lightly with her, so\r\nthat the extreme fascination of her manner, and the animation and\r\nintelligence of her countenance, made her compete with many younger\r\nbeauties. She felt that she was deteriorated from the angelic being she\r\nhad seemed when she first appeared as Lodore's bride; and this made all\r\ncompliments show false and vain. Now she figured to herself the dark\r\neyes of the Neapolitan; and easily believed that the memory of her would\r\ncontrast, like a faded picture, with the rich hues of Clorinda's face;\r\nwhile her sad and withered feelings were in yet greater opposition to\r\nthe vivacity she had heard described and praised--to the triumphant and\r\nglad feelings of a beloved wife. It seemed to her as if she must weep\r\nfor ever, and yet that tears were unavailing to diminish in any degree\r\nthe sorrow that weighed so heavily at her heart. These reflections sat\r\nlike a night-mare on her pillow, troubling the repose she in vain\r\ncourted. She arose in the morning, scarcely conscious that she had slept\r\nat all--languid from exhaustion--her sufferings blunted by their very\r\nexcess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nO, where have I been all this time? How 'friended\r\nThat I should lose myself thus desp'rately.\r\nAnd none for pity show me how I wandered!\r\n\r\nBEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile it was yet too early for visitors, and before she had ordered\r\nherself to be denied to every one, as she intended to do, she was\r\nsurprised by a double knock at the door, and she rang hastily to prevent\r\nany one being admitted. The servants, with contradictory orders, found\r\nit difficult to evade the earnest desire of the visitor to see their\r\nlady; and at last they brought up a card, on which was written, \"Miss\r\nDerham wishes to be permitted to see Lady Lodore for Mrs. Villiers.\"\r\n_From_ had first been written, erased, and _for_ substituted. Lady Lodore\r\nwas alarmed; and the ideas of danger and death instantly presenting\r\nthemselves, she desired Miss Derham to be shown up. She met her with a\r\nface of anxiety, and with that frankness and kindness of manner which\r\nwas the irresistible sceptre she wielded to subdue all hearts. Fanny had\r\nhitherto disliked Lady Lodore. She believed her to be cold, worldly, and\r\nselfish--now, in a moment, she was convinced, by the powerful influence\r\nof manner, that she was the contrary of all this; so that instead of the\r\nchilling address she meditated, she was impelled to throw off her\r\nreserve, and to tell her story with animation and detail. She spoke of\r\nwhat Mrs. Villiers had gone through previous to the arrest of her\r\nhusband--and how constantly she had kept her resolve of remaining with\r\nhim--though her situation day by day becoming more critical, demanded\r\nattentions and luxuries which she had no means of attaining. \"Yet,\" said\r\nFanny, \"I should not have intruded on you even now, but that they cannot\r\ngo on as they are; their resources are utterly exhausted,--and until\r\nnext June I see no prospect for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why does not Mr. Villiers apply to his father? even if letters were of\r\nno avail, a personal appeal--\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that Colonel Villiers has\r\nnothing to give,\" replied Fanny, \"and at all events, Mr. Villiers's\r\nimprisonment--\"\r\n\r\n\"Prison!\" cried Lady Lodore, \"you do not mean--Ethel cannot be\r\nliving in prison!\"\r\n\r\n\"They live within the rules, if you understand that term. They rent a\r\nlodging close to the prison on the other side of the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"This must indeed be altered,\" said Lady Lodore, \"this is far too\r\nshocking--poor Ethel, she must come here! Dear Miss Derham, will you\r\ntell her how much I desire to see her, and entreat her to make my house\r\nher home.\"\r\n\r\nFanny shook head. \"She will not leave her husband--I should make your\r\nproposal in vain.\"\r\n\r\nLady Lodore looked incredulous. After a moment's thought she persuaded\r\nherself that Ethel's having refused to return to the house of Mrs. Derham,\r\nor having negatived some other proposed kindness originated this notion,\r\nand she believed that she had only to make her invitation in the most\r\ngracious possible way, not to have it refused. \"I will go to Ethel\r\nmyself,\" she said; \"I will myself bring her here, and so smooth all\r\ndifficulties.\"\r\n\r\nFanny did not object. Under her new favourable opinion of Lady Lodore, she\r\nfelt that all would be well if the mother and daughter were brought\r\ntogether, though only for a few minutes. She wrote down Ethel's address,\r\nand took her leave, while at the same moment Lady Lodore ordered her\r\ncarriage, and assured her that no time should be lost in removing Mrs.\r\nVilliers to a more suitable abode.\r\n\r\nLady Lodore's feelings on this occasion were not so smiling as her looks.\r\nShe was grieved for her daughter, but she was exceedingly vexed for\r\nherself. She had desired some interest, some employment in life, but she\r\nrecoiled from any that should link her with Ethel. She desired occupation,\r\nand not slavery; but to bring the young wife to her own house, and make it\r\na home for her, was at once destructive of her own independence. She\r\nlooked forward with repugnance to the familiarity that must thence ensue\r\nbetween her and Villiers. Even the first step was full of annoyance, and\r\nshe was displeased that Fanny had given her the task of going to her\r\ndaughter's habitation, and forced her to appear personally on so\r\ndegrading a scene; there was however no help--she had undertaken it, and\r\nit must be done.\r\n\r\nEvery advance she made towards the wretched part of the town where Ethel\r\nlived, added to her ill-humour. She felt almost personally affronted by\r\nthe necessity she was under of first coming in contact with her daughter\r\nunder such disastrous circumstances. Her spleen against Lord Lodore\r\nrevived: she viewed every evil that had ever befallen her, as arising from\r\nhis machinations. If Ethel had been entrusted to her guardianship, she\r\ncertainly had never become the wife of Edward Villiers--nor ever have\r\ntasted the dregs of opprobrious poverty.\r\n\r\nAt length, her carriage drew near a row of low, shabby houses; and as\r\nthe name caught her eye she found that she had reached her destination.\r\nShe resolved not to see Villiers, if it could possibly be avoided; and\r\nthen making up her mind to perform her part with grace, and every show\r\nof kindness, she made an effort to smooth her brow and recall her\r\nsmiles. The carriage stopped at a door--a servant-maid answered to the\r\nknock. She ordered Mr. Villiers to be asked for; he was not at home. One\r\nobjection to her proceeding was removed by this answer. Mrs. Villiers\r\nwas in the house, and she alighted and desired to be shown to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nAs flowers beneath May's footsteps waken\r\nAs stars from night's loose hair are shaken;\r\nAs waves arise when loud winds call,\r\nThoughts sprung where'er that step did fall.\r\n\r\nSHELLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever before had the elegant and fastidious Lady Lodore entered such an\r\nabode, or ascended such stairs. The servant had told her to enter the room\r\nat the head of the first flight, so she made her way by herself, and\r\nknocked at the door. The voice that told her to come in, thrilled\r\nthrough her, she knew not why, and she became disturbed at finding that\r\nher self-possession was failing her. Slight things act powerfully on the\r\nsubtle mechanism of the human mind. She had dressed with scrupulous\r\nplainness, yet her silks and furs were strangely contrasted with the\r\nroom she entered, and she felt ashamed of all the adjuncts of wealth and\r\nluxury that attended her. She opened the door with an effort: Ethel was\r\nseated near the fire at work--no place or circumstance could deteriorate\r\nfrom her appearance--in her simple, unadorned morning-dress, she looked\r\nas elegant and as distinguished as she had done when her mother had last\r\nseen her in diamonds and plumes in the presence of royalty. There was\r\na charm about both, strikingly in contrast, and yet equal in\r\nfascination--the polish of Lady Lodore, and the simplicity of Ethel were\r\nboth manifestations of inward grace and dignity; and as they now met, it\r\nwould have been difficult to say which had the advantage of the other.\r\nEthel's extreme youth, by adding to the interest with which she must be\r\nregarded, was in her favour. Yet full of sensibility and loveliness as\r\nwas her face, she had never been, nor was she even now, as strikingly\r\nbeautiful as her mother.\r\n\r\nLady Lodore could not restrain the tear that started into her eye on\r\nbeholding her daughter situated as she was. Ethel's feelings, on the\r\ncontrary, were all gladness. She had no pride to allay her gratitude for\r\nher mother's kindness. \"How very good of you to come!\" she said, \"how could\r\nyou find out where we were?\"\r\n\r\n\"How long have you been here?\" asked Lady Lodore, looking round the\r\nwretched little room.\r\n\r\n\"Only a few weeks--I assure you it is not so bad as it seems. I should\r\nnot much mind it, but that Edward feels it so deeply on my account.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wonder,\" said her mother, \"he must be cut to the soul--but\r\nthank God it is over now. You shall come to me immediately, my house is\r\nquite large enough to accommodate you--I am come to fetch you.\"\r\n\r\n\"My own dearest mother!\"--the words scarcely formed themselves on\r\nEthel's lips; she half feared to offend the lovely woman before her by\r\nshowing her a daughter's affection.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, call me mother,\" said Lady Lodore; \"I may, at last, I hope, be\r\nallowed to prove myself one. Come then, dear Ethel, you will not refuse my\r\nrequest--you will come with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"How gladly--but--will they let Edward go? I thought there was no hope\r\nof so much good fortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear indeed,\" replied her mother, \"that Mr. Villiers must endure the\r\nannoyance of remaining here a little longer; but I hope his affairs will\r\nsoon be arranged.\"\r\n\r\nEthel bent her large eyes inquiringly on her mother, as if not\r\nunderstanding; and then, as her meaning opened on her, a smile diffused\r\nitself over her countenance as she said, \"Your intentions are the\r\nkindest in the world--I am grateful, how far more grateful than I can at\r\nall express, for your goodness. That you have had the kindness to come\r\nto this odious place is more than I could ever dare expect.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not worth your thanks, although I think I deserve your\r\nacquiescence to my proposal. You will come home with me?\"\r\n\r\nEthel shook her head, smilingly. \"All my wishes are accomplished,\" she\r\nsaid, \"through this kind visit. I would not have you for the world come\r\nhere again; but the wall between us is broken down, and we shall not\r\nbecome strangers again.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dearest Ethel,\" said Lady Lodore, seriously, \"I see what you mean. I\r\nwish Mr. Villiers were here to advocate my cause. You must come with me--he\r\nwill be much more at ease when you are no longer forced to share his\r\nannoyances. This is in every way an unfit place for you, especially at\r\nthis time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall appear ungrateful, I fear,\" replied Ethel, \"if I assure you how\r\nmuch better off I am here than I could be any where else in the world.\r\nThis place appears miserable to you--so I dare say it is; to me it seems\r\nto possess every requisite for happiness, and were it not so, I would\r\nrather live in an actual dungeon with Edward, than in the most splendid\r\nmansion in England, away from him.\"\r\n\r\nHer face was lighted up with such radiance as she spoke--there was so\r\nmuch fervour in her voice--such deep affection in her speaking\r\neyes--such an earnest demonstration of heartfelt sincerity, that Lady\r\nLodore was confounded and overcome. Swift, as if a map had been unrolled\r\nbefore her, the picture of her own passed life was retraced in her\r\nmind--its loneless and unmeaning pursuits--and the bitter disappointments\r\nthat had blasted every hope of seeing better days. She burst into tears.\r\nEthel was shocked and tried to soothe her by caresses and assurances of\r\ngratitude and affection. \"And yet you will not come with me?\" said Lady\r\nLodore, making an effort to resume her self-command.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot. It is impossible for me voluntarily to separate myself from\r\nEdward--I am too weak, too great a coward.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is there no hope of liberation for him?\" This question of Lady\r\nLodore forced them back to matter-of-fact topics, and she became composed.\r\nEthel related how ineffectual every endeavour had yet been to arrange\r\nhis affairs, how large his debts, how inexorable his creditors, how\r\nneglectful his attorney.\r\n\r\n\"And his father?\" inquired her mother.\r\n\r\n\"He seems to me to be kind-hearted,\" replied Ethel, \"and to feel deeply\r\nhis son's situation; but he has no means--he himself is in want.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is keeping a carriage at this moment in Paris,\" said Lady Lodore, \"and\r\ngiving parties--however, I allow that that is no proof of his having\r\nmoney. Still you must not stay here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor shall we always,\" replied Ethel; \"something of course will happen\r\nto take us away, though as yet it is all hopeless enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aunt Bessy, Mrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry, might give you assistance. Have\r\nyou asked her?--has she refused?\"\r\n\r\n\"Edward has exacted a promise from me not to reveal our perplexities to\r\nher--he is punctilious about money obligations, and I have given my word\r\nnot to hurt his delicacy on that point.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then that, perhaps, is the reason why you refused my request to go home\r\nwith me?\" said Lady Lodore reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Ethel, \"I do not think that he is so scrupulous as to\r\nprevent a mother from serving her child, but he shall answer for\r\nhimself; I expect him back from his walk every minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then forgive me if I run away,\" said Lady Lodore; \"I am not fit to see him\r\nnow. Better times will come, dearest Ethel, and we shall meet again. God\r\nbless you, my child, as so much virtue and patience deserve to be blest.\r\nRemember me with kindness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not you forget me,\" replied Ethel, \"or rather, do not think of me\r\nand my fortunes with too much disgust. We shall meet again, I hope?\"\r\n\r\nLady Lodore kissed her, and hurried away. Scarcely was she in her carriage\r\nthan she saw Villiers advancing: his prepossessing appearance, ingenuous\r\ncountenance, and patrician figure, made more intelligible to her\r\nworld-practised eyes the fond fidelity of his wife. She drew up the\r\nwindow that he might not see her, as she gave her directions for \"home,\"\r\nand then retreating to the corner of her carriage, she tried to compose\r\nher thoughts, and to reflect calmly on what was to be done.\r\n\r\nBut the effort was vain. The further she was removed from the strange\r\nscene of the morning, the more powerfully did it act on, and agitate her\r\nmind. Her soul was in tumults. This was the being she had pitied, almost\r\ndespised! Her eager imagination now exalted her into an angel. There was\r\nsomething heart-moving in the gentle patience, and unrepining\r\ncontentment with which she bore her hard lot. She appeared in her eyes\r\nto be one of those rare examples sent upon earth to purify human nature,\r\nand to demonstrate how near akin to perfection we can become. Latent\r\nmaternal pride might increase her admiration, and maternal tenderness\r\nadd to its warmth. Her nature had acknowledged its affinity to her\r\nchild, and she felt drawn towards her with inexpressible yearnings. A\r\nvehement desire to serve her sprung up--but all was confused and\r\ntumultuous. She pressed her hand on her forehead, as if so to restrain\r\nthe strong current of thought. She compressed her lips, so to repress\r\nher tears.\r\n\r\nArrived at home, she found herself in prison within the walls of her\r\nchamber. She abhorred its gilding and luxury--she longed for Ethel's\r\nscant abode and glorious privations. To alleviate her restlessness, she\r\nagain drove out, and directed her course through the Regent's Park, and\r\nalong the new road to Hampstead, where she was least liable to meet any\r\none she knew. It was one of the first fine days of spring. The green\r\nmeadows, the dark boughs swelling and bursting into bud, the fresh\r\nenlivening air, the holiday of nature's birth--all this was lost on her,\r\nor but added to her agitation. Still her thoughts were with her child in\r\nher narrow abode; every lovely object served but to recall her image,\r\nand the wafting of the soft breeze seemed an emanation from her. It was\r\ndark before she came back, and sent a hurried note of excuse to the\r\nhouse where she was to have dined. \"No more, O never more,\" she cried,\r\n\"will I so waste my being, but learn from Ethel to be happy, and to\r\nlove.\"\r\n\r\nMany thoughts and many schemes thronged her brain. Something must be\r\ndone, or her heart would burst. Pride, affection, repentance, all\r\noccupied the same channel, and increased the flood that swept away every\r\nidea but one. Her very love for Horatio, true and engrossing as it had\r\nbeen, the source of many tears and endless regrets, appeared as slight\r\nas the web of gossamer, compared to the chain that bound her to her\r\ndaughter. She could not herself understand, nor did she wish to know,\r\nwhence and why this enthusiasm had risen like an exhalation in her soul,\r\ncovering and occupying its entire space. She only knew it was there,\r\ninterpenetrating, paramount. Ethel's dark eyes and silken curls, her\r\nsweet voice and heavenly smile, formed a moving, speaking picture, which\r\nshe felt that it were bliss to contemplate for ever. She retired at last\r\nto bed, but not to rest; and as she lay with open eyes, thinking not of\r\nsleep--alive in every pore--her brain working with ten thousand\r\nthoughts, one at last grew more importunate than the rest, and demanded\r\nall her attention. Her ideas became more consecutive, though not less\r\nrapid and imperious. She drew forth in prospect, as it were, a map of\r\nwhat was to be done, and the results. Her mind became fixed, and\r\nsensations of ineffable pleasure accompanied her reveries. She was\r\nresolved to sacrifice every thing to her daughter--to liberate Villiers,\r\nand to establish her in ease and comfort. The image of self-sacrifice,\r\nand of the ruin of her own fortunes, was attended with a kind of\r\nrapture. She felt as if, in securing Ethel's happiness, she could never\r\nfeel sorrow more. This was something worth living for: the burden of\r\nlife was gone--its darkness dissipated--a soft light invested all\r\nthings, and angels' voices invited her to proceed. While indulging in\r\nthese reveries, she sunk into a balmy sleep--such a one she had not\r\nenjoyed for many months--nay, her whole past life had never afforded her\r\nso sweet a joy. The thoughts of love, when she believed that she should\r\nbe united to Saville, were not so blissful; for self-approbation,\r\nderived from a consciousness of virtue and well-doing, hallowed every\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nLike gentle rains on the dry plains,\r\nMaking that green which late was grey;\r\nOr like the sudden moon, that stains\r\nSome gloomy chamber's window panes,\r\nWith a broad light like day.\r\n\r\nSHELLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow mysterious a thing is the action of repentance in the human mind! We\r\nwill not dive into the debasing secrets of remorse for guilt. Lady Lodore\r\ncould accuse herself of none. Yet when she looked back, a new light shone\r\non the tedious maze in which she had been lost; a light--and she blessed\r\nit--that showed her a pathway out of tempest and confusion into serenity\r\nand peace. She wondered at her previous blindness; it was as if she had\r\nclosed her eyelids, and then fancied it was night. No fear that she\r\nshould return to darkness; her heart felt so light, her spirit so clear\r\nand animated, that she could only wonder how it was she had missed\r\nhappiness so long, when it needed only that she should stretch out her\r\nhand to take it.\r\n\r\nHer first act on the morrow was to have an interview with her\r\nson-in-law's solicitor. Nothing could be more hopeless than Mr.\r\nGayland's representation of his client's affairs. The various deeds of\r\nsettlement and entail, through which he inherited his estate, were\r\nclogged in such a manner as to render an absolute sale of his\r\nreversionary prospects impossible, so that the raising of money on them\r\ncould only be effected at an immense future sacrifice. Under these\r\ncircumstances Gayland had been unwilling to proceed, and appeared\r\nlukewarm and dilatory, while he was impelled by that love for the\r\npreservation of property, which often finds place in the mind of a legal\r\nadviser.\r\n\r\nLady Lodore listened attentively to his statements. She asked the extent of\r\nEdward's debts, and somewhat started at the sum named as necessary to\r\nclear him. She then told Mr. Gayland that their ensuing conversation\r\nmust continue under a pledge of secrecy on his part. He assented, and\r\nshe proceeded to represent her intention of disposing of her jointure\r\nfor the purpose of extricating Villiers from his embarrassments. She\r\ngave directions for its sale, and instructions for obtaining the\r\nnecessary papers to effect it. Mr. Gayland's countenance brightened; yet\r\nhe offered a few words of remonstrance against such unexampled\r\ngenerosity.\r\n\r\n\"The sacrifice,\" said Lady Lodore, \"is not so great as you imagine. A\r\nvariety of circumstances tend to compensate me for it. I do not depend upon\r\nthis source of income alone; and be assured, that what I do, I consider, on\r\nthe whole, as benefiting me even more than Mr. Villiers.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gayland bowed; and Cornelia returned home with a light heart. For\r\nmonths she had not felt such an exhilaration of spirits. A warm joy\r\nthrilled through her frame, and involuntary smiles dimpled her cheeks.\r\nDusky and dingy as was the day, the sunshine of her soul dissipated its\r\nshadows, and spread brightness over her path. She could scarcely\r\ncontroul the expression of her delight; and when she sat down to write\r\nto Ethel, it was several minutes before she was able to collect her\r\nthoughts, so as to remember what she had intended to say. Two notes were\r\ndestroyed before she had succeeded in imparting that sobriety to her\r\nexpressions, which was needful to veil her purpose, which she had\r\nresolved to lock within her own breast for ever. At length she was\r\nobliged to satisfy herself with a few vague expressions. This was her\r\nletter:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I cannot help believing, my dearest girl, that your trials are coming\r\nto a conclusion. I have seen Mr. Gayland; and it appears to me that\r\nenergy and activity are chiefly wanting for the arrangement of your\r\nhusband's affairs: I think I have in some degree inspired these. He has\r\npromised to write to Mr. Villiers, who, I trust, will find satisfaction\r\nin his views. Do you, my dearest Ethel, keep up your spirits, and take\r\ncare of your precious health. We shall meet again in better days, when\r\nyou will be rewarded for your sufferings and goodness. Believe me, I\r\nlove as much as I admire you; so, in spite of the past, think of me with\r\nindulgence and affection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Lodore dressed to dine out, and for an evening assembly. She looked so\r\nradiant and so beautiful, that admiration and compliments were showered\r\nupon her. How vain and paltry they all seemed; and yet her feelings were\r\nwholly changed from that period, when she desired to reject and scoff at\r\nthe courtesy of her fellow-creatures. The bitterness of spirit was gone,\r\nwhich had prompted her to pour out gall and sarcasm, and had made it her\r\ngreatest pleasure to revel in the contempt and hate that filled her\r\nbosom towards herself and others. She was now at peace with the world,\r\nand disposed to view its follies charitably. Yet how immeasurably\r\nsuperior she felt herself to all those around her! not through vanity or\r\nsupercilious egotism, but from the natural spring of inward joy and\r\nself-approbation, which a consciousness of doing well opened in her\r\nbefore dried-up heart. She somewhat contemned her friends, and wholly\r\npitied them. But she could not dwell on any disagreeable sentiment. Her\r\nthoughts, while she reverted to the circumstances that so changed their\r\ntenor, were stained with the fairest hues, harmonized by the most\r\ndelicious music. She had risen to a sphere above, beyond the ordinary\r\nsoarings of mortals--a world without a cloud, without one ungenial\r\nbreath. She wondered at herself. She looked back with mingled horror and\r\nsurprise on the miserable state of despondence to which she had been\r\nreduced. Where were now her regrets?--where her ennui, her repinings,\r\nher despair? \"In the deep bosom of the ocean buried!\"--and she arose, as\r\nfrom a second birth, to new hopes, new prospects, new feelings; or\r\nrather to another state of being, which had no affinity to the former.\r\nFor poverty was now her pursuit, obscurity her desire, ruin her hope;\r\nand she smiled on, and beckoned to these, as if life possessed no\r\ngreater blessings.\r\n\r\nHer impetuosity and pride served to sustain the high tone of her soul.\r\nShe had none of that sloth of purpose, or weakness of feeling, that\r\nleads to hesitation and regret. To resolve with her had been, during the\r\nwhole course of her life, to do; and what her mind was set upon she\r\naccomplished--it might be rashly, but still with that independence and\r\nenergy, that gave dignity even to her more ambiguous actions. As before,\r\nwhen she cast off Lodore, she had never admitted a doubt that she was\r\njustified before God and her conscience for refusing to submit to the\r\nmost insulting tyranny; so now, believing that she had acted ill in not\r\ndemanding the guardianship of her daughter, and resolving to atone for\r\nthe evils which were the consequence of this neglect of duty on her\r\npart, she had no misgivings as to the future, but rushed precipitately\r\nonwards. As a racer at the Olympic games, she panted to arrive at the\r\ngoal, though it were only to expire at the moment of its attainment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Ethel had been enchanted by her mother's visit, and spoke of\r\nit to Villiers as a proof of the real goodness of her heart, insisting\r\nthat she was judged harshly and falsely. Villiers smiled incredulously.\r\n\"She gains your esteem at an easy rate,\" he observed; \"cultivate it, if\r\nit makes you happier. It will need more than a mere act of ordinary\r\ncourtesy--more than a slight invitation to her house, to persuade me\r\nthat Lady Lodore is not--what she is--a worshipper of the world, a\r\nfrivolous, unfeeling woman. Mark me whether she comes again.\"\r\n\r\nHer letter, on the following day, strengthened his opinion. \"This is\r\neven insulting,\" he said: \"she takes care to inform you that she will\r\nnot look again on your poverty, but will wait for _better days_ to bring\r\nyou together. The kindness of such an intimation is quite admirable. She\r\nhas inspired Gayland with energy and activity!--O, then, she must be a\r\nMedea, in more senses than the more obvious one.\"\r\n\r\nEthel looked reproachfully. She saw that Villiers was deeply hurt that\r\nLady Lodore had become acquainted with their distresses, and been a witness\r\nof the nakedness of the land. She could not inspire him with the tenderness\r\nthat warmed her heart towards her mother, and the conviction she\r\nentertained, in spite of appearances, (for she was forced to confess to\r\nherself that Lady Lodore's letter was not exactly the one she expected,)\r\nthat her heart was generous and affectionate. It was a comfort to her\r\nthat Fanny Derham participated in her opinions. Fanny was quite sure\r\nthat Lady Lodore would prove herself worthy of the esteem she had so\r\nsuddenly conceived for her; and Ethel listened delightedly to her\r\nassertions--it was so soothing to think well of, to love, and praise her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nThe solicitor's letter, which came, as Lady Lodore announced, somewhat\r\nsurprised Villiers; yet, after a little reflection, he gave no heed to\r\nits contents. It said, that upon further consideration of particular\r\npoints, Gayland perceived certain facilities; by improving upon which,\r\nhe hoped soon to make a favourable arrangement, and to extricate Mr.\r\nVilliers from his involvements. Any thing so vague demanded explanation.\r\nEdward wrote earnestly, requesting one; but his letter remained\r\nunanswered. Perplexed and annoyed, he obtained permission to quit his\r\nbounds for a few hours, and called upon the man of law. Gayland was so\r\nbusy, that he could not afford him more than five minutes' conversation.\r\nHe said that he had hopes--even expectations; that a little time would\r\nshow more; and he begged his client to be patient. Villiers returned in\r\ndespair. The only circumstance that at all served to inspire him with\r\nany hope, was, that on the day succeeding to his visit, he received a\r\nremittance of an hundred pounds from Gayland, who begged to be\r\nconsidered as his banker till the present negociations should be\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\nThere was some humiliation in the knowledge of how welcome this supply\r\nhad become, and Ethel used her gentle influence to mitigate the pain of\r\nsuch reflections. If she ever drooped, it was not for herself, but for\r\nVilliers; and she carefully hid even these disinterested repinings. Her\r\nown condition did not inspire her with any fears, and the anxiety that\r\nshe experienced for her unborn child was untinctured by bitterness or\r\ndespair. She felt assured that their present misfortunes would be of\r\nshort duration; and instead of letting her thoughts dwell on the\r\nmortifications or shame that marked the passing hour, she loved to fill\r\nher mind with pleasing sensations, inspired by the tenderness of her\r\nhusband, the kindness of poor Fanny, and the reliance she had in the\r\nreality of her mother's affection. In vain, she said, did the harsher\r\nelements of life try to disturb the serenity which the love of those\r\naround her produced in her soul. Her happiness was treasured in their\r\nhearts, and did not emanate from the furniture of a room, nor the\r\ncomfort of an equipage. Her babe, if destined to open its eyes first on\r\nsuch a scene, would be still less acted upon by its apparent\r\ncheerlessness. Cradled in her arms, and nourished at her bosom, what\r\nmore benign fate could await the little stranger? What was there in\r\ntheir destiny worthy of grief, while they remained true to each other?\r\n\r\nWith such arguments she tried to inspire Villiers with a portion of that\r\nfortitude and patience which was a natural growth in herself. They had\r\nbut slender effect upon him. Their different educations had made her\r\ngreatly his superior in these virtues; besides that she, with her\r\nsimpler habits and unprejudiced mind, was less shocked by the\r\nconcomitants of penury, than he, bred in high notions of aristocratic\r\nexclusiveness. She had spent her youth among settlers in a new country,\r\nand did not associate the idea of disgrace with want. Nakedness and\r\ngaunt hunger had often been the invaders of her forest home, scarcely to\r\nbe repelled by her father's forethought and resources. How could she\r\ndeem these shameful, when they had often assailed the most worthy and\r\nindustrious, who were not the less regarded or esteemed on that account.\r\nShe had acquired a practical philosophy, while inhabiting the western\r\nwilderness, and beholding the vast variety of life that it presents,\r\nwhich stood her in good stead under her European vicissitudes. The white\r\ninhabitants of America did not form her only school. The Red Indian and\r\nhis squaw were also human beings, subject to the same necessities,\r\nmoved, in the first instance, by the same impulses as herself. All that\r\nbore the human form were sanctified to her by the spirit of sympathy;\r\nand she could not, as Edward did, feel herself wholly outcast and under\r\nban, while kindness, however humble, and intelligence, however lowly,\r\nattended upon her.\r\n\r\nVilliers could not yield to her arguments, nor partake her wisdom; yet\r\nhe was glad that she possessed any source of consolation, however\r\nunimaginable by himself. He buried within his heart the haughty sense of\r\nwrong. He uttered no complaint, though his whole being rebelled against\r\nthe state of inaction to which he was reduced. It maddened him to feel\r\nthat he could not stir a finger to help himself, even while he fancied\r\nthat he saw his young wife withering before his eyes; and looked forward\r\nto the birth of his child, under circumstances, that rendered even the\r\nnecessary attendance difficult, if not impracticable. The heaviest\r\nweight of slavery fell upon him, for it was he that was imprisoned, and\r\nforbidden to go beyond certain limits; and though Ethel religiously\r\nconfined herself within yet narrower bounds than those allotted to him,\r\nhe only saw, in this delicacy, another source of evil. Nor were these\r\nreal tangible ills those which inflicted the greatest pain. Had these\r\nmisfortunes visited him in the American wilderness, or in any part of\r\nthe world where the majesty of nature had surrounded them, he fancied\r\nthat he should have been less alive to their sinister influence. But\r\nhere shame was conjoined with the perpetual spectacle of the least\r\nreputable class of the civilized community. Their walks were haunted by\r\nmen who bore the stamp of profligacy and crime; and the very shelter of\r\ntheir dwelling was shared by the mean and vulgar. His aristocratic pride\r\nwas sorely wounded at every turn;--not for himself so much, for he was\r\nmanly enough to feel \"that a man's a man for all that,\"--but for Ethel's\r\nsake, whom he would have fondly placed apart from all that is deformed\r\nand unseemly, guarded even from the rougher airs of heaven, and\r\nsurrounded by every thing most luxurious and beautiful in the world.\r\n\r\nThere was no help. Now and then he got a letter from his father, full of\r\nunmeaning apologies and unmanly complaints. The more irretrievable his\r\npoverty became, the firmer grew his resolve not to burden with his wants\r\nany more distant relation. He would readily give up every prospect of\r\nfuture wealth to purchase ease and comfort for Ethel; but he could not\r\nbend to any unworthy act; and the harder he felt pressed upon and\r\ninjured by fortune, the more jealously he maintained his independence of\r\nfeeling; on that he would lean to the last, though it proved a sword to\r\npierce him.\r\n\r\nHe looked forward with despair, yet he tried to conceal his worst\r\nthoughts, which would still be brooding upon absolute want and\r\nstarvation. He answered Ethel's cheering tones in accents of like cheer,\r\nand met the melting tenderness of her gaze with eyes that spoke of love\r\nonly. He endeavoured to persuade her that he did not wholly shut his\r\nheart from the hopes she was continually presenting to him. Hopes, the\r\nvery names of which were mockery. For they must necessarily be embodied\r\nin words and ideas--and his father or uncle were mentioned--the one had\r\nproved a curse, the other a temptation. He could trace his reverses as\r\nto the habits of expence and the false views of his resources, acquired\r\nunder Lord Maristow's tutelage, as to the prodigality and neglect of his\r\nparent. Even the name of Horatio Saville produced bitterness. Why was\r\nhe not here? He would not intrude his wants upon him in his Italian\r\nhome; but had he been in England, they had been saved from these worst\r\nblows of fate.\r\n\r\nThe only luxury of Villiers was to steal some few hours of solitude,\r\nwhen he could indulge in his miserable reflections without restraint.\r\nThe loveliness and love of Ethel were then before his imagination to\r\ndrive him to despair. To suffer alone would have been nothing; but to\r\nsee this child of beauty and tenderness, this fairest nursling of nature\r\nand liberty, droop and fade in their narrow, poverty-striken home, bred\r\nthoughts akin to madness. During each live-long night he was kept awake\r\nby the anguish of such reflections. Darker thoughts sometimes intruded\r\nthemselves. He fancied that if he were dead, Ethel would be happier. He\r\nmother, his relations, each and all would come forward to gift her with\r\nopulence and ease. The idea of self-destruction thus became soothing;\r\nand he pondered with a kind of savage pleasure on the means by which he\r\nshould end the coil of misery that had wound round him.\r\n\r\nAt such times the knowledge of Ethel's devoted affection checked him. Or\r\nsometimes, as he gazed on her as she lay sleeping at his side, he felt\r\nthat every sorrow was less than that which separation must produce; and\r\nthat to share adversity with her was greater happiness than the\r\nenjoyment of prosperity apart from her. Once, when brought back from the\r\ngloomiest desperation by such a return of softer emotions, the words of\r\nFrancesca da Rimini rushed upon his mind and completed the change. He\r\nrecollected how she and her lover were consoled by their eternal\r\ncompanionship in the midst of the infernal whirlwind. \"And do I love you\r\nless, my angel?\" he thought; \"are you not more dear to me than woman\r\never was to man, and would I divide myself from you because we suffer?\r\nPerish the thought! Whether for good or ill, let our existences still\r\ncontinue one, and from the sanctity and sympathy of our union, a sweet\r\nwill be extracted, sufficient to destroy the bitterness of this hour. We\r\nprefer remaining together, mine own sweet love, for ever together,\r\nthough it were for an eternity of pain. And these woes are finite. Your\r\npure and exalted nature will be rewarded for its sufferings, and I, for\r\nyour sake, shall be saved. I could not live without you in this world;\r\nand yet with insane purpose I would rush into the unknown, away from\r\nyou, leaving you to seek comfort and support from other hands than mine.\r\nI was base and cowardly to entertain the thought, but for one moment--a\r\ntraitor to my own affection, and the stabber of your peace. Ah, dearest\r\nEthel, when in a few hours your eyes will open on the light, and seek me\r\nas the object most beloved by them, were I away, unable to return their\r\nfondness, incapable of the blessing of beholding them, what hell could\r\nbe contrived to punish more severely my dereliction of duty?\"\r\n\r\nWith this last thought another train of feeling was introduced, and he\r\nstrung himself to more manly endurance. He saw that his post was\r\nassigned him in this world, and that he ought to fulfil its duties with\r\ncourage and patience. Hope came hand in hand with such ideas--and the\r\ndawn of content on his soul was a proof that the exercise of virtue\r\nbrought with it its own reward. He could not always keep his feelings in\r\nthe same tone, but he no longer saw greatness of mind in the indulgence\r\nof sorrow.\r\n\r\nHe remembered that throughout the various stations into which society\r\nhas divided human beings, adversity and pain belong to each, and that\r\ndeath and treachery are more frightful evils than all the hardships of\r\nlife. He thought of his unborn child, and of his duties towards it--not\r\nonly in a worldly point of view, but as its teacher and guide in morals\r\nand religion. The beauty and use of the ties of blood, to which his\r\npeculiar situation had hitherto blinded him, became intelligible at once\r\nto his heart and his understanding; and while he felt how ill his father\r\nhad fulfilled the paternal duties, he resolved that his own offspring\r\nshould never have cause to reproach him for similar misconduct. Before\r\nhe had repined because the evils of his lot seemed gratuitous suffering;\r\nbut now he felt, as Ethel had often expressed it, that the sting of\r\nhumiliation is taken from misfortune, when we nerve ourselves to endure\r\nit for another's sake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world had just begun to steal\r\nEach hope that led me lightly on,\r\nI felt not as I used to feel,\r\nAnd life grew dark and love was gone.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the young pair were thus struggling with the severe visitation of\r\nadversity, Lady was earnestly engaged in her endeavours to extricate\r\nthem from their difficulties. The ardour of her zeal had made her take\r\nthe first steps in this undertaking, with a resolution that would not\r\nlook behind, and a courage not to be dismayed by the dreary prospect\r\nwhich the future afforded. The scheme which she had planned, and was now\r\nproceeding to execute, was unbounded in generosity and self-sacrifice.\r\nIt was not in her nature to stop short at half-measures, nor to pause\r\nwhen once she had fixed her purpose. If she ever trembled on looking\r\nforward to the utter ruin she was about to encounter, her second emotion\r\nwas to despise herself for such pusillanimity, and to be roused to\r\nrenewed energy. She intended to devote as much as was necessary of the\r\nmoney arising from the sale of her jointure, as fixed by her marriage\r\nsettlement, for the liquidation of her son-in-law's debts. The remaining\r\nsix hundred a-year, bequeathed to her in Lord Lodore's will, under\r\ncircumstances of cruel insult, she resolved to give up to her daughter's\r\nuse, for her future subsistence. She hoped to save enough from the sum\r\nproduced by the disposal of her jointure, to procure the necessaries of\r\nlife for a few years, and she did not look beyond. She would quit London\r\nfor ever. She must leave her house, which she had bought during her days\r\nof prosperity, and which she had felt so much pride and delight in\r\nadorning with every luxury and comfort: to crown her good work, she\r\nintended to give it up to Ethel. And then with her scant means she would\r\ntake refuge in the solitude where Lodore found her, and spend the\r\nresidue of her days among the uncouth and lonely mountains of Wales, in\r\npoverty and seclusion. It was from no agreeable association with her\r\nearly youth, that she selected the neighbourhood of Rhaider Gowy for her\r\nfuture residence; nor from a desire of renewing the recollections of the\r\nperiod spent there, nor of revisiting the scenes, where she had stepped\r\nbeyond infancy into the paths of life. Her choice simply arose from\r\nbeing obliged to think of economy in its strictest sense, and she\r\nremembered this place as the cheapest in the world, and the most\r\nretired. Besides, that in fixing on a part of the country which she had\r\nbefore inhabited, and yet where she would be utterly unknown, the idea\r\nof her future home assumed distinctness, and a greater sense of\r\npracticability was imparted to her schemes, than could have been the\r\ncase, had she been unable to form any image in her mind of the exact\r\nspot whither she was about to betake herself.\r\n\r\nThe first conception of this plan had dawned on her soul, as the design\r\nof some sublime poem or magnificent work of art may present itself to\r\nthe contemplation of the poet and man of genius. She dwelt on it in its\r\nentire result, with a glow of joy; she entered into its details with\r\nchildish eagerness. She pictured to herself the satisfaction of Villiers\r\nand Ethel at finding themselves suddenly, as by magic, restored to\r\nfreedom and the pleasures of life. She figured their gladness in\r\nexchanging their miserable lodging for the luxury of her elegant\r\ndwelling; their pleasure in forgetting the long train of previous\r\nmisfortunes, or remembering them only to enhance their prosperity, when\r\npain and fear, disgrace and shame, should be exchanged for security and\r\ncomfort. She repeated to herself, \"I do all this--I, the despised\r\nCornelia! I who was deemed unworthy to have the guardianship of my own\r\nchild. I, who was sentenced to desertion and misery, because I was too\r\nworldly and selfish to be worthy of Horace Saville! How little through\r\nlife has my genuine character been known, or its qualities appreciated!\r\nNor will it be better understood now. My sacrifices will continue a\r\nmystery, and even the benefits I am forced to acknowledge to flow from\r\nme, I shall diminish in their eyes, by bestowing them with apparent\r\nindifference. Will they ever deign to discover the reality under the\r\ndeceitful appearances which it will be my pride to exhibit? I care not;\r\nconscience will approve me--and when I am alone and unthought of, the\r\nknowledge that Ethel is happy through my means will make poverty a\r\nblessing.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not pride alone that induced Lady Lodore to resolve on concealing\r\nthe extent of her benefits. All that she could give was not much if\r\ncompared with the fortunes of the wealthy--but it was a competence, which\r\nwould enable her daughter and her husband to expect better days with\r\npatience; but if they knew how greatly she was a sufferer for their good,\r\nthey would insist at least upon her sharing their income--and what was\r\nscanty in its entireness, would be wholly insufficient when divided.\r\nVilliers also might dispute or reject her kindness, and deeply injured as\r\nshe believed herself to have been by him--injured by his disesteem, and the\r\ninfluence he had used over Saville, in a manner so baneful to her\r\nhappiness, she felt irrepressible exultation at the idea of heaping\r\nobligation on him,--and knowing herself to be deserving of his deepest\r\ngratitude. All these sentiments might be deemed fantastic, or at least\r\nextravagant. Yet her conclusions were reasonable, for it was perfectly\r\ntrue that Villiers would rather have returned to his prison, than have\r\npurchased freedom at the vast price she was about to pay for it. No, her\r\ndesign was faultless in its completeness, meagre and profitless if she\r\nstopt short of its full execution. Nor would she see Ethel again in the\r\ninterim--partly fearful of not preserving her secret inviolate--partly\r\nbecause she felt so strongly drawn towards her, that she dreaded finding\r\nherself the slave of an affection--a passion, which, under her\r\ncircumstances, she could not indulge. Without counsellor, without one\r\nfriendly voice to encourage, she advanced in the path she had marked\r\nout, and drew from her own heart only the courage to proceed.\r\n\r\nIt required, however, all her force of character to carry her forward. A\r\nthousand difficulties were born at every minute, and the demands made\r\nwere increased to such an extent as to make it possible that they would\r\ngo beyond her means of satisfying them. She had not the assistance of\r\none friend acquainted with the real state of things to direct her--her\r\nonly adviser was a man of law, who did what he was directed--not indeed\r\nwith passive obedience, but whose deviations from mere acquiescence,\r\narose from technical objections and legal difficulties, at once\r\nunintelligible and tormenting.\r\n\r\nBesides these more palpable annoyances, other clouds arose, natural to\r\nwavering humanity, which would sometimes shadow Cornelia's soul, so that\r\nshe drooped from he height she had reached, with a timid and dejected\r\nspirit. At first she looked forward to ruin, exile, and privation, as to\r\npossessions which she coveted--but the further she proceeded, the more\r\nshe lost view of the light and gladness which had attended on the dawn\r\nof her new visions. Futurity became enveloped in an appalling obscurity,\r\nwhile the present was sad and cheerless. The ties which she had formed\r\nin the world, which she had fancied it would be so easy to cut asunder,\r\nassumed strength; and she felt that she must endure many pangs in the\r\nact of renouncing them for ever. The scenes and persons which, a little\r\nwhile ago, she had regarded as uninteresting and frivolous--she was now\r\nforced to acknowledge to be too inextricably interwoven with her habits\r\nand pursuits, to be all at once quitted without severe pain. When the\r\nfuture was spoken of by others with joyous anticipation, her heart sunk\r\nwithin her, to think how her hereafter was to become disjointed and cast\r\naway from all that had preceded it. The mere pleasures of society grew\r\ninto delights, when thought of as about to become unattainable; and\r\nslight partialities were regarded as if founded upon strong friendship\r\nand tender affection. She was not aware till now how habit and\r\nassociation will endear the otherwise indifferent, and how the human\r\nheart, prone to love, will entwine its ever-sprouting tendrils around\r\nany object, not absolutely repulsive, which is brought into near contact\r\nwith it. When any of her favourites addressed her in cordial tones, when\r\nshe met the glance of one she esteemed, directed towards her with an\r\nexpression of kindliness and sympathy, her eyes grew dim, and a thrill\r\nof anguish passed through her frame. All that she had a little while ago\r\nscorned as false and empty, she now looked upon as the pleasant reality\r\nof life, which she was to exchange for she scarcely knew what--a living\r\ngrave, a friendless desart--for silence and despair.\r\n\r\nIt is a hard trial at all times to begin the world anew, even when we\r\nexchange a mediocre station for one which our imagination paints as full\r\nof enjoyment and distinction. How much more difficult it was for Lady to\r\ndespoil herself of every good, and voluntarily to encounter poverty in\r\nits most unadorned guise. As time advanced, she became fully aware of\r\nwhat she would have to go through, and her heroism was the greater,\r\nbecause, though the charm had vanished, and no hope of compensation or\r\nreward was held out, she did not shrink from accomplishing her task. She\r\ncould not exactly say, like old Adam in the play,\r\n\r\n\r\nAt seventeen years many their fortunes seek,\r\nBut at fourscore it is too late a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet at her age it was perhaps more difficult to cast off the goods of this\r\nworld, than at a more advanced one. Midway in life, we are not weaned\r\nfrom affections and pleasures--we still hope. We even demand more of\r\nsolid advantages, because the romantic ideas of youth have disappeared,\r\nand yet we are not content to give up the game. We no longer set our\r\nhearts on ephemeral joys, but require to be enabled to put our trust in\r\nthe continuance of any good offered to our choice. This desire of\r\ndurability in our pleasures is equally felt by the young; but ardour of\r\nfeeling and ductility of imagination is then at hand to bestow a\r\nquality, so dear and so unattainable to fragile humanity, on any object\r\nwe desire should be so gifted. But at a riper age we pause, and seek\r\nthat our reason may be convinced, and frequently prefer a state of\r\nprosperity less extatic and elevated, because its very sobriety\r\nsatisfies us that it will not slip suddenly from our grasp.\r\n\r\nThe comforts of life, the esteem of friends--these are things which we\r\nthen regard with the greatest satisfaction; and other feelings, less\r\nreasonable, yet not less keenly felt, may enter into the circle of\r\nsensations, which forms the existence of a beautiful woman. It is less\r\neasy for one who has been all her life admired and waited upon, to give\r\nup the few last years of such power, than it would have been to cast\r\naway the gift in earlier life. She has learned to doubt her influence,\r\nto know its value, and to prize it. In girlhood it may be matter of mere\r\ntriumph--in after years it will be looked on as an inestimable quality\r\nby which she may more easily and firmly secure the benevolence of her\r\nfellow-creatures. All this depends upon the polish of the skin and the\r\nfire of the eye, which a few years will deface and quench--and while the\r\nopprobrious epithet of old woman approaches within view, she is glad to\r\nfeel secure from its being applied to her, by perceiving the signs of\r\nthe influence of her surviving attractions marked in the countenances of\r\nher admirers. Lady never felt so kindly inclined towards hers, as now\r\nthat she was about to withdraw from them. Their admiration, for its own\r\nsake, she might contemn, but she valued it as the testimony that those\r\ncharms were still hers, which once had subdued the soul of him she\r\nloved--and this was no disagreeable assurance to one who was on the eve\r\nof becoming a grandmother.\r\n\r\nHer sensibility, awakened by the considerations forced on her by her new\r\ncircumstances, caused her to make more progress in the knowledge of\r\nlife, and in the philosophy of its laws, than love or ambition had ever\r\ndone before. The last had rendered her proud from success, the first had\r\ncaused her to feel dependent on one only; but now that she was about to\r\nabandon all, she found herself bound to all by stronger ties than she\r\ncould have imagined. She became aware that any new connexion could never\r\nbe adorned by the endearing recollections attending those she had\r\nalready formed. The friends of her youth, her mere acquaintances, she\r\nregarded with peculiar partiality, as being the witnesses or sharers of\r\nher past joys and successes. Each familiar face was sanctified in her\r\neyes by association; and she walked among those whom she had so lately\r\nscorned, as if they were saintly memorials to be approached with awe,\r\nand quitted with eternal regret. Her hopes and prospects had hinged upon\r\nthem, but her life became out of joint when she quitted them. Her\r\nsensitive nature melted in unwonted tenderness while occupied by such\r\ncontemplations, and they turned the path, she had so lately entered as\r\none of triumph and gladness, to gloom and despondence.\r\n\r\nSometimes she pondered upon means for preserving her connexion with the\r\nworld. But any scheme of that kind was fraught, on the one hand, with\r\nmortification to herself, on the other, with the overthrow of her\r\ndesigns, through the repugnance which Ethel and her husband would feel\r\nat occasioning such unmeasured sacrifices. She often regretted that\r\nthere were no convents, to which she might retire with safety and\r\ndignity. Conduct, such as she contemplated pursuing, would, under the\r\nold regime in France, have been recompensed by praise and gratitude;\r\nwhile its irrevocability must prevent any resistance to her wishes. In\r\ngiving up fortune and station, she would have placed herself under the\r\nguardianship of a community; and have found protection and security, to\r\ncompensate for poverty and slavery. The very reverse of all this must\r\nnow happen. Alone, friendless, unknown, and therefore despised, she must\r\nshift for herself, and rely on her own resources for prudence to insure\r\nsafety, and courage to endure the evils of her lot. To one of another\r\nsex, the name of loneliness can never convey the idea of desolation and\r\ndisregard, which gives it so painful a meaning in a woman's mind. They\r\nhave not been taught always to look up to others, and to do nothing for\r\nthemselves; so that business becomes a matter of heroism to a woman,\r\nwhen conducted in the most common-place way; but when it is accompanied\r\nby mystery, she feels herself transported from her fitting place, and as\r\nif about to encounter shame and contumely. Lady Lodore had never been\r\nconversant with any mode of life, except that of being waited on and\r\nwatched over. In the poverty of her early girlhood, her mother had been\r\nconstantly at her side. The necessity of so conducting herself as to\r\nprevent the shadow of slander from visiting her, had continued this\r\nstate of dependence during all her married life. She had never stept\r\nacross a street without attendance; nor put on her gloves, but as\r\nbrought to her by a servant. Her look had commanded obedience, and her\r\nwill had been law with those about her. This was now to be altered. She\r\nscarcely reverted in her mind to these minuti\u00e6; and when she did, it\r\nwas to smile at herself for being able to give weight to such trifles.\r\nShe was not aware how, hereafter, these small things would become the\r\nshapings and embodyings which desertion and penury would adopt, to sting\r\nher most severely. The new course she was about to enter, was too\r\nunknown to make her fears distinct. There was one vast blank before her,\r\none gigantic and mishapen image of desertion, which filled her mind to\r\nthe exclusion of every other, but whose parts were not made out, though\r\nthis very indistinctness was the thing that often chiefly appalled her.\r\n\r\nShe said, with the noble exile,[2]--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,\r\nToo far in years to be a pupil now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is true that she had not, like him,\r\nto lament that--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My native English, now I must forego;\"\r\n\r\n\r\nbut there is\r\nanother language, even more natural than the mere dialect in which we\r\nhave been educated. When our lips no longer utter the sentiments of our\r\nheart--when we are forced to exchange the spontaneous effusions of the\r\nsoul for cramped and guarded phrases, which give no indication of the\r\nthought within,--then, indeed, may we say, that our tongue becomes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . \"an unstringed viol, or a harp,\r\n. . . . . . put into his hands,\r\nThat knows no touch to tune the harmony.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this was to be Lady Lodore's position. Her only companions would be\r\nvillagers; or, at best, a few Welsh gentry, with whom she could have no\r\nreal communication. Sympathy, the charm of life, was dead for her, and\r\nher state of banishment would be far more complete than if mountains and\r\nseas only constituted its barriers.\r\n\r\nLady Lodore was often disturbed by these reflections, but she did not on\r\nthat account waver in her purpose. The flesh might shrink, but the spirit\r\nwas firm. Sometimes, indeed, she wondered how it was that she had first\r\nconceived the design, which had become the tyrant of her life. She had\r\nlong known that she had a daughter, young, lovely, and interesting,\r\nwithout any great desire to become intimate with her. Sometimes pride,\r\nsometimes indignation, had checked her maternal feelings. The only time\r\nbefore, in which she had felt any emotion similar to that which now\r\ngoverned her, was on the day when she had spoken to her in the House of\r\nLords. But instead of indulging it, she had fled from it as an enemy,\r\nand despised herself as a dupe, for being for one instant its subject.\r\nWhen her fingers then touched her daughter's cheek, she had not trembled\r\nlike Ethel; yet an awful sensation passed through her frame, which for a\r\nmoment stunned her, and she hastily retreated, to recover herself. Now,\r\non the contrary, she longed to strain her child to her heart; she\r\nthought no sacrifice too great, which was to conduce to her advantage;\r\nand that she condemned herself never to see her more, appeared the\r\nhardest part of the lot she was to undergo. Why was this change? She\r\ncould not tell--memory could not inform her. She only knew that since\r\nshe had seen Ethel in her adversity, the stoniness of her heart had\r\ndissolved within her, that her whole being was subdued to tenderness,\r\nand that the world was changed from what it had been in her eyes. She\r\nfelt that she could not endure life, unless for the sake of benefiting\r\nher child; and that this sentiment mastered her in spite of herself, so\r\nthat every struggle with it was utterly vain.\r\n\r\nThus if she sometimes repined at the hard fate that drove her into\r\nexile, yet she never wavered in her intentions; and in the midst of\r\nregret, a kind of exultation was born, which calmed her pain. Smiles sat\r\nupon her features, and her voice was attuned to cheerfulness. The\r\nnew-sprung tenderness of her soul imparted a fascination to her manner\r\nfar more irresistible than that to which tact and polish had given rise.\r\nShe was more kind and affectionate, and, above all, more sincere, and\r\ntherefore more winning. Every one felt, though none could divine the\r\ncause of, this change. It was remarked that she was improved: some\r\nshrewdly suspected that she was in love. And so she was--with an object\r\nmore enchanting than any earthly lover. For the first time she knew and\r\nloved the Spirit of good and beauty, an affinity to which affords the\r\ngreatest bliss that our nature can receive.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Richard II.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the same, for be it joy or sorrow.\r\nThe path of its departure still is free;\r\nMan's yesterday can ne'er be like his morrow,\r\nNor aught endure save mutability.\r\n\r\nSHELLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe month of June had commenced. In spite of lawyer's delays and the\r\ndifficulties attendant on all such negociations, they were at last\r\nconcluded, and nothing remained but for Lady to sign the paper which was\r\nto consign her to comparative destitution. In all changes we feel most\r\nkeenly the operation of small circumstances, and are chiefly depressed\r\nby the necessity of stooping to the direction of petty arrangements, and\r\nhaving to deal with subordinate persons. To complete her design, Lady\r\nLodore had to make many arrangements, trivial yet imperative, which\r\ncalled for her attention, when she was least fitted to give it. She had\r\nmet these demands on her patience without shrinking; and all was\r\nprepared for the finishing stroke about to be put to her plans. She\r\ndismissed those servants whom she did not intend to leave in the house\r\nfor Ethel's use. She contrived to hasten the intended marriage of her\r\nown maid, so to disburthen herself wholly. The mode by which she was,\r\nsolitary and unknown, to reach the mountains of Wales, without creating\r\nsuspicion, or leaving room for conjecture, was no easy matter. In human\r\nlife, one act is born of another, so that any one that disjoins itself\r\nfrom the rest, instantly gives rise to curiosity and inquiry. Lady\r\nLodore, though fertile in expedients, was almost foiled: the eligibility\r\nof having one confidant pressed itself upon her. She thought of Fanny\r\nDerham; but her extreme youth, and her intimacy with Mrs. Villiers,\r\nwhich would have necessitated many falsehoods, so to preserve the\r\nsecret, deterred her: she determined at last to trust to herself alone.\r\nShe resolved to take with her one servant only, who had not been long in\r\nher service, and to dismiss him immediately after leaving London.\r\nDifficulties presented themselves on every side; but she believed that\r\nthey could be best surmounted by obviating them in succession as they\r\narose, and that any fixed artificial plan would only tend to embarrass,\r\nwhile a simple mode of proceeding would continue unquestioned.\r\n\r\nHer chief art consisted in not appearing to be making any change at all.\r\nShe talked of a visit of two or three months to Emms, and mentioned her\r\nintention of lending her house, during the interval, to her daughter.\r\nShe thus secured to herself a certain period during which no curiosity\r\nwould be exicited; and after a month or two had passed away, she would\r\nbe utterly forgotten:--thus she reasoned; and whether it were a real\r\ntomb that she entered, or the living grave which she anticipated, her\r\nname and memory would equally vanish from the earth, and she be thought\r\nof no more. If Ethel ever entertained a wish to see her, Villiers would\r\nbe at hand to check and divert it. Who else was there to spend a thought\r\nupon her? Alone upon earth, no friendly eye, solicitous for her welfare,\r\nwould seek to penetrate the mystery in which she was about to envelope\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThe day came, it was the second of June, when every preliminary was\r\naccomplished. She had signed away all that she possessed--she had done\r\nit with a smile--and her voice was unfaltering. The sum which she had\r\nsaved for herself consisted of but a few hundred pounds, on which she\r\nwas to subsist for the future. Again she enforced his pledge of secrecy\r\non Mr. Gayland; and glad that all was over, yet heavy at heart in spite\r\nof her gladness, she returned to her home, which in a few hours she was\r\nto quit for ever.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time, her thoughts had seldom reverted to Saville. Hope\r\nwas dead, and the regrets of love had vanished with it. That he would\r\napprove her conduct, was an idea that now and then flashed across her\r\nmind; but he would remain in eternal ignorance, and therefore it could\r\nnot bring their thoughts into any communion. Whether he came to England,\r\nor remained at Naples, availed her nothing. No circumstance could add\r\nto, or diminish, the insuperable barrier which his marriage placed\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nShe returned home from her last interview with Mr. Gayland: it was four\r\no'clock in the day; at six she had appointed Fanny Derham to call on\r\nher; and an hour afterwards, the horses were ordered to be at the door,\r\nwhich were to convey her away.\r\n\r\nShe became strangely agitated. She took herself to task for her\r\nweakness; but every moment disturbed yet more the calm she was so\r\nanxious to attain. She walked through the rooms of the house she had\r\ndwelt in for so many years. She looked on the scene presented from her\r\nwindows. The drive in Hyde Park was beginning to fill with carriages and\r\nequestrians, to be thronged with her friends whom she was never again to\r\nsee. Deep sadness crept over her mind. Her uncontrollable thoughts, by\r\nsome association of ideas, which she could not disentangle--brought\r\nbefore her the image of Lodore, with more vividness than it had possessed\r\nfor years. A kind of wish to cross the Atlantic, and to visit the scenes\r\nwhere he had dwelt so long, arose within her; and then again she felt a\r\ndesire to visit Longfield, and to view the spot in which his mortal\r\nremains were laid. As her imagination pictured the grave of the husband\r\nof her youth, whom she had abandoned and forgotten, tears streamed from\r\nher eyes--the first she had shed, even in idea, beside it. \"It is not to\r\natone--for surely I was not guilty towards him\"--such were Lady Lodore's\r\nreflections,--\"yet, methinks, in this crisis of my fate, when about to\r\nimitate his abrupt and miserable act of self-banishment, my heart yearns\r\nfor some communication with him; and it seems to me as if, approaching\r\nhis cold, silent dust, he would hear me if I said, 'Be at peace! your\r\nchild is happy through my means!\"'\r\n\r\nAgain her reveries were attended by a gush of tears. \"How strange a fate\r\nis mine, ever to be abandoned by, or to abandon, those towards whom I am\r\nnaturally drawn into near contact. Fifteen years are flown since I\r\nparted from for ever! Then by inspiring one so high-minded, so richly\r\ngifted, as Saville, with love for me, fortune appeared ready to\r\ncompensate for my previous sufferings; but the curse again operated, and\r\nI shall never see him more. Yet do I not forget thee, Saville, nor thy\r\nlove!--nor can it be a crime to think of the past, which is as\r\nirretrievable as if the grave had closed over it. Through Saville it has\r\nbeen that I have not lived quite in vain--that I have known what love\r\nis; and might have even tasted of happiness, but for the poison which\r\nperpetually mingles with my cup. I never wish to see him more; but if I\r\nearnestly desire to visit Lodore's grave, how gladly would I make a far\r\nlonger pilgrimage to see Saville's child, and to devote myself to one\r\nwho owes its existence to him. Wretched Cornelia! what thoughts are\r\nthese? Is it now, that you are a beggar and an outcast, that you first\r\nencourage unattainable desires?\"\r\n\r\nStill as she looked round, and remembered how often Saville had been\r\nbeside her in that room, thoughts and regrets thronged faster and more\r\nthickly on her. She recollected the haughty self-will and capricious\r\ncoquetry which had caused the destruction of her dearest hopes. She took\r\ndown a miniature of herself, which her lover had so fruitlessly besought\r\nher to give him. It was on the belief that she had bestowed this picture\r\non a rival that he had so suddenly come to the determination of quitting\r\nEngland. It seemed now in its smiles and youth to reproach her for\r\nhaving wasted both; and the sight of it agitated her bosom, and produced\r\na tumult of regret and despair at his loss--till she threw it from her,\r\nas too dearly associated with one she must forget. And yet wherefore\r\nforget?--he had forgotten; but as a dead wife might in her grave, love\r\nher husband, though wedded to another, so might the lost, buried\r\nCornelia remember him, though the husband of Clorinda. Self-compassion\r\nnow moved her to tears, and she wept plentiful showers, which rather\r\nexhausted than relieved her.\r\n\r\nWith a strong effort she recalled her sense of what was actually going\r\non, and struggling resolutely to calm herself, she sat down and began a\r\nletter to her daughter, which was necessary, as some sort of\r\nexplanation, at once to allay wonder and baffle curiosity. Thus she\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"DEAREST ETHEL,\r\n\r\n\"My hopes have not been deceived. Mr. Gayland has at last contrived\r\nmeans for the liberation of your husband; and to-morrow morning you will\r\nleave that shocking place. Perhaps I receive more pleasure from this\r\npiece of good fortune than you, for your sense of duty and sweet\r\ndisposition so gild the vilest objects, that you live in a world of your\r\nown, as beautiful as yourself, and the accident of situation is\r\nimmaterial to you.\r\n\r\n\"It is not enough, however, that you should be free. I hope that the\r\npunctilious delicacy of Mr. Villiers will not cause you to reject the\r\nbenefits of a mother. In this instance there is more of justice than\r\ngenerosity in my offer; and it may therefore be accepted without the\r\nsmallest hesitation. My jointure ought to satisfy me, and the additional\r\nsix hundred a year--which I may call the price of blood, since I bought\r\nit at the sacrifice of the dearest ties and duties,--is most freely at\r\nyour service. It will delight me to get rid of it, as much as if thus I\r\nthrew off the consciousness of a crime. It is yours by every law of\r\nequity, and will be hereafter paid into your banker's hands. Do not\r\nthank me, my dear child--be happy, that will be my best reward. Be\r\nhappy, be prudent--this sum will not make you rich; and the only\r\nacknowledgment I ask of you is, that you make it suffice, and avoid debt\r\nand embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"By singular coincidence I am imperatively obliged to leave England at\r\nthis moment. The horses are ordered to be here in half an hour--I am\r\nobliged therefore to forego the pleasure of seeing you until my return.\r\nWill you forgive me this apparent neglect, which is the result of\r\nnecessity, and favour me by coming to my house to-morrow, on leaving\r\nyour present abode, and making it your home until my return? Miss Derham\r\nhas promised to call here this afternoon; I shall see her before I go,\r\nand through her you will learn how much you will make me your debtor by\r\naccepting my offers, and permitting me to be of some slight use to you.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse the brevity and insufficiency of this letter, written at the\r\nmoment of departure.--You will hear from me again, when I am able to\r\nsend you my address, and I shall hope to have a letter from you.\r\nMeanwhile Heaven bless you, my angelic Ethel! Love your mother, and\r\nnever, in spite of every thing, permit unkind thoughts of her to harbour\r\nin your mind. Make Mr. Villiers think as well of me as he can, and\r\nbelieve me that your welfare will always be the dearest wish of my\r\nheart. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\"Ever affectionately yours.\r\n\r\n\"C. LODORE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShe folded and sealed this letter, and at the same moment there was a\r\nknock at the door of her house, which she knew announced the arrival of\r\nFanny Derham. She was still much agitated, and trying to calm herself,\r\nshe took up a newspaper, and cast her eyes down the columns; so, by one\r\nof the most common place of the actions of our life, to surmount the\r\npainful intensity of her thoughts. She read mechanically one or two\r\nparagraphs--she saw the announcements of births, marriages, and deaths.\r\n\"My moral death will not be recorded here,\" she thought, \"and yet, I\r\nshall be more dead than any of these.\" The thought in her mind remained\r\nas it were truncated; her eye was arrested--a paleness came over\r\nher--the pulses of her heart paused, and then beat tumultuously--how\r\nstrange--how fatal were the words she read!--\r\n\r\n\"Died suddenly at the inn at the Mola di Gaeta, on her way from Naples,\r\nClorinda, the wife of the honourable Horatio Saville, in the\r\ntwenty-second year of her age.\"\r\n\r\nHer drawing-room door was opened, the butler announced Miss Derham,\r\nwhile her eyes still were fixed on the paragraph: her head swam\r\nround--the world seemed to slide from under her. Fanny's calm clear\r\nvoice recalled her. She conquered her agitation--she spoke as if she had\r\nnot just crossed a gulf--not been transported to a new world; and,\r\nagain, swifter than light, brought back to the old one. She conversed\r\nwith Fanny for some time; giving some kind of explanation for not having\r\nbeen to see Ethel, begging her young friend to press her invitation, and\r\nspeaking as if in autumn they should all meet again. Fanny, philosophic as\r\nshe was, regarded Lady Lodore with a kind of idolatry. The same charm that\r\nhad fascinated the unworldly and abstracted Saville, she exercised over\r\nthe thoughtful and ingenuous mind of the fair young student. It was the\r\nattraction of engaging manners, added now to the sense of right, joined\r\nto the timid softness of a woman, who trembled on acting unsupported,\r\neven though her conscience approved her deeds. It was her loveliness\r\nwhich had gained in expression what it had lost in youth, and kindness\r\nof heart was the soul of the enchantment. Fanny ventured to remonstrate\r\nagainst her sudden departure. \"O we shall soon meet again,\" said\r\nCornelia; but her thoughts were more of heaven than earth, as the scene\r\nof meeting; for her heart was chilled--her head throbbed--the words she\r\nhad read operated a revolution in her frame, more allied to sickness and\r\ndeath, than hope or triumph.\r\n\r\nFanny at length took her leave, and Lady Lodore was again alone. She took\r\nup the newspaper--hastily she read again the tidings; she sunk on the sofa,\r\nburying her face in the pillow, trying not to think, while she was\r\nindeed the prey to the wildest thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" thus ran her reflections, \"he is free--he is no longer _married_!\r\nFool, fool! he is still lost to you!--an outcast and a beggar, shall I\r\nsolicit his love! which he believes that I rejected when prosperous.\r\nRather never, never, let me see him again. My beauty is tarnished, my\r\nyouth flown; he would only see me to wonder how he had ever loved me.\r\nBetter hide beneath the mountains among which I am soon to find a\r\nhome--better, far better, die, than see Saville and read no love in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"Yet thus again I cast happiness from me. What then would I do? Unweave\r\nthe web--implore Mr. Villiers to endure my presence--reveal my state of\r\nbeggary--ask thanks for my generosity, and humbly wait for a kind glance\r\nfrom Saville, to raise me to wealth as well as to happiness.--Cornelia,\r\nawake!--be not subdued at the last-act not against your disposition, the\r\npride of your soul--the determinations you have formed--do not learn to\r\nbe humble in adversity--you, who were disdainful in happier days--no! if\r\nthey need me--if they love me--if Saville still remembers the\r\nworship--the heart's entire sacrifice which once he made to me--will a\r\nfew miles-the obscurity of my abode--or the silence and mystery that\r\nsurrounds me, check his endeavours that we should once again meet?\r\n\r\n\"No!\" she said, rising, \"my destiny is in other and higher hands than my\r\nown. It were vain to endeavour to controul it. Whatever I do, works\r\nagainst me; now let the thread be spun to the end, while I do nothing; I\r\ncan but endure the worst patiently; and how much better to bear in\r\nsilence, than to struggle vainly with the irrevocable decree! I submit.\r\nLet Providence work out its own ends, and God dispose of the being he\r\nhas made--whether I reap the harvest in this world or in the next, my\r\npart is played, I will strive no more!\"\r\n\r\nShe believed in her own singleness of purpose as she said this, and yet\r\nshe was never more deceived. While she boasted of her resignation, she\r\nwas yielding not to a high moral power, but to the pride of her soul.\r\nHer resolutions were in accordance with the haughtiness of her\r\ndisposition, and she felt satisfied, not because she was making a noble\r\nsacrifice, but because she thus adorned more magnificently the idol she\r\nset up for worship, and believed herself to be more worthy of applause\r\nand love. Yet who could condemn even errors that led to such unbending\r\nand heroic forgetfulness of all the baser propensities of our nature.\r\nNor was this feeling of triumph long-lived; the wounding and humiliating\r\nrealities of life, soon degraded her from her pedestal, and made her\r\nfeel, as it were, the disgrace and indignities of abdication.\r\n\r\nHer travelling chariot drove up to the door, and, after a few moments'\r\npreparation, she was summoned. Again she looked round the room; her\r\nheart swelled high with impatience and repining, but again she conquered\r\nherself. She took up her miniature--_that_ now she might possess--for she\r\ncould remember without sin--she took up the newspaper, which did or did\r\nnot contain the fiat of her fate; but this action appeared to militate\r\nagainst the state of resignation she had resolved to attain, so she\r\nthrew it down: she walked down the stairs, and passed out from her house\r\nfor the last time--she got into the carriage--the door was closed--the\r\nhorses were in motion-all was over.\r\n\r\nHer head felt sick and heavy; she leaned back in her carriage half\r\nstupified. When at last London and its suburbs were passed, the sight of\r\nthe open country a little revived her--but she soon drooped again.\r\nNothing presented itself to her thoughts with any clearness, and the\r\nexultation which had supported her vanished totally. She only knew that\r\nshe was alone, poor, forgotten; these words hovered on her lips, mingled\r\nwith others, by which she endeavoured to charm away her despondency.\r\nFortitude and resignation for herself--freedom and happiness for Ethel.\r\n\"O yes, she is free and happy--it matters not then what I am!\" No tears\r\nflowed to soften this thought. The bright green country--the meadows\r\nmingled with unripe corn-fields--the tufted woods--the hedgerows full of\r\nflowers, could not attract her eye; pangs every now and then seized upon\r\nher heart--she had talked of resignation, but she was delivered up to\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nAt length she sank into a kind of stupor. She was accompanied by one\r\nservant only; she had told him where she intended to remain that night.\r\nIt was past eleven before they arrived at Reading; the night was chill,\r\nand she shivered while she felt as if it were impossible to move, even\r\nto draw up the glasses of her chariot. When she arrived at the inn where\r\nshe was to pass the night, she felt keenly the discomfort of having no\r\nfemale attendant. It was new--she felt as if it were disgraceful, to\r\nfind herself alone among strangers, to be obliged to give orders\r\nherself, and to prepare alone for her repose.\r\n\r\nAll night she could not sleep, and she became aware at last that she was\r\nill. She burnt with fever--her whole frame was tormented by aches, by\r\nalternate hot and shivering fits, and by a feeling of sickness. When\r\nmorning dawned, it was worse. She grew impatient--she rose. She had\r\narranged that her servant should quit her at this place. He had been but\r\na short time with her, and was easily dismissed under the idea, that she\r\nwas to be joined by a man recommended by a friend, who was accustomed to\r\nthe continent, whither it was supposed that she was going. She had\r\ndismissed him the night before, he was already gone, when on the morrow\r\nshe ordered the horses.--She paid the bills herself--and had to answer\r\nquestions about luggage; all these things are customary to the poor, and\r\nto the other sex. But take a high-born woman and place her in immediate\r\ncontact with the rough material of the world, and see how like a\r\nsensitive plant she will shrink, close herself up and droop, and feel as\r\nif she had fallen from her native sphere into a spot unknown, ungenial,\r\nand full of storms.\r\n\r\nThe illness that oppressed Lady Lodore, made these natural feelings even\r\nmore acute, till at last they were blunted by the same cause. She now\r\nwondered what it was that ailed her, and became terrified at the\r\noccasional wanderings that interrupted her torpor. Once or twice she\r\nwished to speak to the post-boy, but her voice failed her. At length\r\nthey drove up to the inn at Newbury; fresh horses were called for, and\r\nthe landlady came up to the door of the carriage, to ask whether the\r\nlady had breakfasted--whether she would take anything. There was\r\nsomething ghastly in Lady Lodore's appearance, which at once frightened\r\nthe good woman, and excited her compassion. She renewed her questions,\r\nwhich Lady Lodore had not at first heard, adding, \"You seem ill, ma'am;\r\ndo take something--had you not better alight?\"\r\n\r\n\"O yes, far better,\" said Cornelia, \"for I think I must be very ill.\"\r\n\r\nThe change of posture and cessation of motion a little revived her, and\r\nshe began to think that she was mistaken, and that it was all nothing,\r\nand that she was well. She was conducted into the parlour of the inn,\r\nand the landlady left her to order refreshment. \"How foolish I am,\" she\r\nthought; \"this is mere fancy; there is nothing the matter with me;\" and\r\nshe rose to ring the bell, and to order horses. When suddenly, without\r\nany previous warning, struck as by a bolt, she fainted, and fell on the\r\nfloor, without any power of saving herself. The sound of her fall\r\nquickened the steps of the landlady, who was returning; all the\r\nchamber-maids were summoned, a doctor sent for, and when Lady Lodore opened\r\nher eyes she saw unknown faces about her, a strange place, and voices yet\r\nstranger. She did not speak, but tried to collect her thoughts, and to\r\nunravel the mystery, as it appeared, of her situation. But soon her\r\nthoughts wandered, and fever and weakness made her yield to the\r\nsolicitations of those around. The doctor came, and could make out\r\nnothing but that she was in a high fever: he ordered her to be put to\r\nbed. And thus--Saville, and Ethel, and all hopes and fears, having\r\nvanished from her thoughts,--given up to delirium and suffering, poor\r\nLady Lodore, alone, unknown, and unattended, remained for several weeks\r\nat a country inn--under the hands of a village doctor--to recover, if\r\nGod pleased, if not, to sink, unmourned and unheard of, into an untimely\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if for me thou dost forsake\r\nSome other maid, and rudely break\r\nHer worshipped image from its base,\r\nTo give to me the ruined place--\r\n\r\nThen fare thee well--I'd rather make\r\nMy bower upon some icy lake,\r\nWhen thawing suns begin to shine,\r\nThan trust to love so false as thine!\r\n\r\nLALLA ROOKH.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the same day Mr. and Mrs. Villiers left their sad dwelling to take\r\npossession of lady Lodore's house. The generosity and kindness of her\r\nmother, such as it appeared, though she knew but the smallest portion of\r\nit, charmed Ethel. Her heart, which had so long struggled to love her, was\r\ngladdened by the proofs given that she deserved her warmest affection.\r\nThe truest delight beamed from her lovely countenance. Even she had felt\r\nthe gloom and depression of adversity. The sight of misery or vice in\r\nthose around her tarnished the holy fervour with which she would\r\notherwise have made every sacrifice for Edward's sake. There is\r\nsomething in this world, which even while it gives an unknown grace to\r\nrough, and hard, and mean circumstances, contaminates the beauty and\r\nharmony of the noble and exalted. Ethel had been aware of this; she\r\ndreaded its sinister influence over Villiers, and in spite of herself\r\nshe pined; she had felt with a shudder that in spite of love and\r\nfortitude, a sense, chilling and deponding, was creeping over her,\r\nmaking her feel the earth alien to her, and calling her away from the\r\nsadness of the scene around to a world bright and pure as herself. Her\r\nvery despair thus dressed itself in the garb of religion; and though\r\nthese visitations of melancholy only came during the absence of Villiers\r\nand were never indulged in, yet they were too natural a growth of their\r\nwretched abode to be easily or entirely dismissed. Even now that she was\r\nrestored to the fairer scenes of life, compassion for the unfortunate\r\nbeings she quitted haunted her, and her feelings were too keenly alive\r\nto the miseries which her fellow-creatures suffered, to permit her to be\r\nrelieved from all pain by her own exemption. She turned from such\r\nreflections to the image of her dear kind mother with delight. The roof\r\nthat sheltered her was hallowed as hers; all the blessings of life which\r\nshe enjoyed came to her from the same source as life itself. She\r\ndelighted to trace the current of feeling which had occasioned her to\r\ngive up so much, and to imagine the sweetness of disposition, the\r\nvivacity of mind, the talents and accomplishments which her physiognomy\r\nexpressed, and the taste manifested in her house, and all the things\r\nwhich she had collected around her, evinced.\r\n\r\nIn less than a month after their liberation, she gave birth to son. The\r\nmingled danger and rejoicing attendant on this event, imparted fresh\r\nstrength to the attachment that united Edward to her; and the little\r\nstranger himself was a new object of tenderness and interest. Thus their\r\ndays of mourning were exchanged for a happiness most natural and welcome\r\nto the human heart. At this time also Horatio Saville returned from\r\nItaly with his little girl. She was scarcely more than a year old, but\r\ndisplayed an intelligence to be equalled only by her extraordinary\r\nbeauty. Her golden silken ringlets were even then profuse, her eyes were\r\nas dark and brilliant as her mother's, but her complexion was fair, and\r\nthe same sweet smile flitted round her infant mouth, as gave the charm\r\nto her father's face. He idolized her, and tried by his tenderness and\r\nattention to appease, as it were, the manes of the unfortunate Clorinda.\r\n\r\nShe, poor girl, had been the victim of the violence of passion and\r\nill-regulated feelings native to her country, excited into unnatural\r\nforce by the singularity of her fate. When Saville saw her first in her\r\nconvent, she was pining for liberty; she did not think of any joy beyond\r\nescaping the troublesome impertinence of the nuns and the monotonous\r\ntenor of monastic life, of associating with people she loved, and\r\nenjoying the common usages of life, unfettered by the restrictions that\r\nrendered her present existence a burthen. But though she desired no\r\nmore, her disgust for the present, her longing for a change, was a\r\npowerful passion. She was adorned by talents, by genius; she was\r\neloquent and beautiful, and full of enthusiasm and feeling. Saville\r\npitied her; he lamented her future fate among her unworthy countrymen;\r\nhe longed to cherish, to comfort, and to benefit her. His heart, so\r\neasily won to tenderness, gave her readily a brother's regard. Others,\r\nseeing the active benevolence and lively interest that this sentiment\r\nelicited, might have fancied him inspired by a warmer feeling; but he\r\nwell knew the difference, he ardently desired her happiness, but did not\r\nseek his own in her.\r\n\r\nHe visited her frequently, he brought her books, he taught her English.\r\nThey were allowed to meet daily in the parlour of the convent, in the\r\npresence of a female attendant; and his admiration of her talents, her\r\nimagination, her ardent comprehensive mind, increased on every\r\ninterview. They talked of literature--the poets--the arts; Clorinda sang\r\nto him, and her fine voice, cultivated by the nicest art, was a source\r\nof deep pleasure and pain to her auditor. His sensibility was awakened\r\nby the tones of love and rapture--sensibility, not alas! for her who\r\nsang, but for the false and absent. While listening, his fancy recalled\r\nLady Lodore's image; the hopes she had inspired, the rapture he had felt in\r\nher presence--the warm vivifying effect her voice and looks had on him\r\nwere remembered, and his heart sank within him to think that all this\r\nsweetness was deceptive, fleeting, lost. Once, overcome by these\r\nthoughts, he resolved to return suddenly to England, to make one effort\r\nmore to exchange unendurable wretchedness for the most transporting\r\nhappiness;--absence from Cornelia, to the joy of pouring out the\r\noverflowing sentiments of his heart at her feet. While indulging in this\r\nidea, a letter from his sister Lucy caused a painful revulsion; she\r\npainted the woman of the world given up to ambition and fashion,\r\nrejoicing in his departure, and waiting only the moment when she might\r\nwith decency become the wife of another. Saville was almost maddened--he\r\ndid not visit Clorinda for three days. She received him, when at last he\r\ncame, without reproach, but with transport; she saw that sadness, even\r\nsickness, dimmed his eye; she soothed him, she hung over him with\r\nfondness, she sung to him her sweetest, softest airs; his heart melted,\r\na tear stole from his eye. Clorinda saw his emotion; it excited hers;\r\nher Neapolitan vivacity was not restrained by shame nor fear,--she spoke\r\nof her love for him with the vehemence she felt, and youth and beauty\r\nhallowed the frankness and energy of her expressions. Saville was\r\ntouched and pleased,--he left her to meditate on this new state of\r\nthings--for free from passion himself, he had never suspected the growth\r\nof it in her heart. He reflected on all her admirable qualities, and the\r\npity it was that they should be cast at the feet of one of her own\r\nunrefined, uneducated countrymen, who would be incapable of appreciating\r\nher talents--even her love--so that at last she would herself become\r\ndegraded, and sink into that system of depravity which makes a prey of\r\nall that is lovely or noble in our nature. He could save her--she loved\r\nhim, and he could save her; lost as he was to real happiness, it were to\r\napproximate to it, if he consecrated his life to her welfare.\r\n\r\nYet he would not deceive her. The excess of love which she bestowed\r\ndemanded a return which he could not give. She must choose whether, such\r\nas he was, he were worth accepting. Actuated by a sense of justice, he\r\nopened his heart to her without disguise: he told her of his ill-fated\r\nattachment to another--of his self-banishment, and misery--he declared\r\nhis real and earnest affection for her--his desire to rescue her from\r\nher present fate, and to devote his life to her. Clorinda scarcely heard\r\nwhat he said,--she felt only that she might become his--that he would\r\nmarry her; her rapture was undisguised, and he enjoyed the felicity of\r\nbelieving that one so lovely and excellent would at once owe every\r\nblessing of life to him, and that the knowledge of this must ensure his\r\nown content. The consent of her parents was easily yielded,--the Pope is\r\nalways ready to grant a dispensation to a Catholic wife marrying a\r\nProtestant husband,--the wedding speedily took place--and Saville became\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\nTheir mutual torments now began. Horatio was a man of high and\r\nunshrinking principle. He never permitted himself to think of Lady Lodore,\r\nand the warmth and tenderness of his heart led him to attach himself truly\r\nand affectionately to his wife. But this did not suffice for the\r\nNeapolitan. Her marriage withdrew the veil of life--she imagined that\r\nshe distinguished the real from the fictitious, but her new sense of\r\ndiscernment was the source of torture. She desired to be loved as she\r\nloved; she insisted that her rival should be hated--she was shaken by\r\ncontinual tempests of jealousy, and the violence of her temper,\r\nrestrained by no reserve of disposition, displayed itself frightfully.\r\nSaville reasoned, reproached, reprehended, without any avail, except\r\nthat when her violence had passed its crisis, she repented, and wept,\r\nand besought forgiveness. Ethel's visit had been a blow hard to bear.\r\nShe was the daughter of her whom Saville loved--whom he regretted--on\r\nwhom he expended that passion and idolatry, to attain which she would\r\nhave endured the most dreadful tortures. These were the reflections, or\r\nrather, these were the ravings, of Clorinda. She had never been so\r\nfurious in her jealousy, or so frequent in her fits of passion, as\r\nduring the visit of the unconscious and gentle Ethel.\r\n\r\nThe birth of her child operated a beneficial change for a time; and\r\nexcept when Saville spoke of England, or she imagined that he was\r\nthinking of it, she ceased to torment him. He was glad; but the moment\r\nwas passed when she could command his esteem, or excite his spontaneous\r\nsympathy. He pitied and he loved her; but it was almost as we may become\r\nattached to an unfortunate and lovely maniac; less than ever did he seek\r\nhis happiness in her. He loved his infant daughter now better than any\r\nother earthly thing. Clorinda rejoiced in this tie, though she soon grew\r\njealous even of her own child.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Lord Maristow and his daughters was at first full of\r\nbenefit to the discordant pair. Clorinda was really desirous of\r\nobtaining their esteem, and she exerted herself to please: when they\r\ntalked of her return to England with them, it only excited her to try to\r\nrender Italy so agreeable as to induce them to remain there. They were\r\nnot like Ethel. They were good girls, but fashionable and fond of\r\npleasure. Clorinda devised a thousand amusements--concerts, tableaux,\r\nthe masquerades of the carnival, were all put in requisition. They\r\ncarried their zeal for amusement so far as to take up their abode for a\r\nday or two at Pompeii, feigning to be its ancient inhabitants, and,\r\nbringing the _corps operatique_ to their aid, got up Rossini's opera of\r\nthe Ultimi Giorni di Pompeii among the ruins, ending their masquerade by\r\na mimic eruption. These gaieties did not accord with the classic and\r\nrefined tastes of Saville; but he was glad to find his wife and sisters\r\nagree so well, and under the blue sky, and in the laughing land of\r\nNaples, it was impossible not to find beauty and enjoyment even in\r\nextravagance and folly.\r\n\r\nStill, like a funeral bell heard amidst a feast, the name of England,\r\nand the necessity of her going thither, struck on the ear and chilled\r\nthe heart of the Neapolitan. She resolved never to go; but how could she\r\nrefuse to accompany her husband's sisters? how resist the admonitions\r\nand commands of his father? She did not refuse therefore--she seemed to\r\nconsent--while she said to Saville, \"Poison, stab me--cast me down the\r\ncrater of the mountain--exhaust your malice and hatred on me as you\r\nplease here--but you shall never take me to England but as a corpse.\"\r\n\r\nSaville replied, \"As you will.\" He was tired of the struggle, and left\r\nthe management of his departure to others.\r\n\r\nOne day his sisters described the delights of a London season, and\r\nstrove to win Clorinda by the mention of its balls, parties, and opera;\r\nthey spoke of Almack's, and the leaders of fashion; they mentioned Lady\r\nLodore. They were unaware that Clorinda knew any thing of their brother's\r\nattachment, and speaking of her as one of the most distinguished of\r\ntheir associates in the London world, made their sister-in-law aware,\r\nthat when she made a part of it, she would come into perpetual contact\r\nwith her rival. This allusion caused one of her most violent paroxysms\r\nof rage as soon as she found herself alone with her husband. So frantic\r\ndid she seem, that Horatio spoke seriously to his father, and declared\r\nhe knew of no argument nor power which could induce Clorinda to\r\naccompany them to England. \"Then you must go without her,\" said Lord\r\nMaristow; \"your career, your family, your country, must not be\r\nsacrificed to her unreasonable folly.\" And then, wholly unaware of the\r\ncharacter of the person with whom he had to deal, he repeated the same\r\nthing to Clorinda. \"You must choose,\" he said, \"between Naples and your\r\nhusband--he must go; do you prefer being left behind?\"\r\n\r\nClorinda grew pale, even livid. She returned home. Horatio was not\r\nthere; she raved through her house like a maniac; her servants even hid\r\nher child from her, and she rushed from room to room tearing her hair,\r\nand calling for Saville. At length he entered; her eyes were starting\r\nfrom her head, her frame working with convulsive violence; she strove to\r\nspeak--to give utterance to the vehemence pent up within her. She darted\r\ntowards him; when suddenly, as if shot to the heart, she fell on the\r\nmarble pavement of her chamber, and a red stream poured from her\r\nlips--she had burst a blood-vessel.\r\n\r\nFor many days she was not allowed to speak nor move. Saville nursed her\r\nunremittingly--he watched by her at night--he tried to soothe her--he\r\nbrought her child to her side--his sweetness, and gentleness, and real\r\ntenderness were all expended on her. Although violent, she was not\r\nungenerous. She was touched by his attentions, and the undisguished\r\nsolicitude of his manner. She resolved to conquer herself, and in a fit\r\nof heroism formed the determination to yield, and to go to England. Her\r\nfirst words, when permitted to speak, were to signify her assent.\r\nSaville kissed and thanked her. She had half imagined that he would\r\nimitate her generosity, and give up the journey. No such thought crossed\r\nhis mind; her distaste was too unreasonable to elicit the smallest\r\nsympathy, and consequently any concession. He thanked her warmly, it is\r\ntrue; and looked delighted at this change, but without giving her time\r\nto retract, he hurried to communicate to his relations the agreeable\r\ntidings.\r\n\r\nAs she grew better she did not recede, but she felt miserable. The good\r\nspirits and ready preparations of Horatio were all acts of treason\r\nagainst her: sometimes she felt angry--but she checked herself. Like all\r\nItalians, Clorinda feared death excessively; besides that, to die was to\r\nyield the entire victory to her rival. She struggled therefore, and\r\nconquered herself; and neither expressed her angry jealousy nor her\r\nterrors. She had many causes of fear; she was again in a situation to\r\nincrease her family within a few months; and while her safety depended\r\non her being able to attain a state of calm, she feared a confinement in\r\nEngland, and believed that it was impossible that she should survive.\r\n\r\nShe was worn to a skeleton--her large eyes were sunk and ringed with\r\nblack, while they burnt with unnatural brilliancy, for her vivacity did\r\nnot desert her, and that deceived those around; they fancied that she\r\nwas convalescent, and would soon recover strength and good looks, while\r\nshe nourished a deep sense of wrong for the slight attention paid to her\r\nsufferings. She wept over herself and her friendless state. Her husband\r\nwas not her friend, for he was not her countryman: and full as Saville\r\nwas of generous sympathy and kindliness for all, the idea of returning\r\nto England, to his home and friends, to the stirring scenes of life, and\r\nthe society of those who loved literature, and were endowed with the\r\nspirit of liberal inquiry and manly habits of thinking, so absorbed and\r\ndelighted him, that he could only thank Clorinda again and again--caress\r\nher, and entreat her to get well, that she might share his pleasures.\r\nHis words chilled her, and she shrunk from his caresses. \"He is thinking\r\nof her, and of seeing her again,\" she thought. She did him the most\r\nflagrant injustice. Saville was a man of high and firm principle, and\r\nhad he been aware of any latent weakness, of any emotion allied to the\r\nmaster-passion of his soul, he would have conquered it, or have fled\r\nfrom the temptation. He never thought less of Lady Lodore than now. The\r\nunwonted gentleness and concessions of his wife--his love for his child,\r\nand the presence of his father and dear sisters, dissipated his\r\nregrets,--his conscience was wholly at ease, and he was happy.\r\n\r\nClorinda dared not complain to her English relatives, but she listened\r\nto the lamentations of her Neapolitan friends with a luxury of woe. They\r\nmourned over her as if she were going to visit another sphere; they\r\npointed out the little island on a map, and seated far off as it was\r\namidst the northern sea, night and storms, they averred, perpetually\r\nbrooded over it, while from the shape of the earth they absolutely\r\nproved that it was impossible to get there. It is true that Lord\r\nMaristow and his daughters, and Saville himself, had come thence--that\r\nwas nothing--it was easy to come away. \"You see,\" they said, \"the earth\r\nslopes down, and the sun is before them; but when they have to go back,\r\nah! it is quite another affair; the Alps rise, and the sea boils over,\r\nand they have to toil up the wall of the world itself into winter and\r\ndarkness. It is tempting God to go there. O stay, Clorinda, stay in\r\nsunny Italy. Orazio will return: do not go to die in that miserable\r\nbirth-place of night and frost.\"\r\n\r\nClorinda wept yet more bitterly over her hard fate, and the\r\nimpossibility of yielding to their wishes. \"Would to God,\" she thought,\r\n\"I could abandon the ingrate, and let him go far from Italy and\r\nClorinda, to die in his wretched country! Would I could forget, hate,\r\ndesert him! Ah, why do I idolize one born in that chilly land, where\r\nlove and passion are unknown or despised!\"\r\n\r\nAt length the day arrived when they left Naples. It was the month of\r\nMay, and very warm. No imagination could paint the glorious beauty of\r\nthis country of enchantment, on the completion of spring, before the\r\nheats of summer had withered its freshness. The sparkling waves of the\r\nblue Mediterranean encircled the land, and contrasted with its hues: the\r\nrich foliage of the trees--the festooning of the luxuriant vines, and\r\nthe abundant vegetation which sprung fresh from the soil, decorating the\r\nrocks, and mantling the earth with flowers and verdure, were all in the\r\nvery prime and blossoming of beauty. The sisters of Saville expressed\r\ntheir admiration in warm and enthusiastic terms; the words trembled on\r\npoor Clorinda's lips; she was about to say, \"Why then desert this land\r\nof bliss?\" but Horatio spoke instead: \"It is splendid, I own, and once I\r\nfelt all that you express. Now a path along a grassy field--a\r\nhedge-row--a copse with a rill murmuring through it--a white cottage\r\nwith simple palings enclosing a flower-garden--the spire of a country\r\nchurch rising from among a tuft of elms--the skies all shadowy with soft\r\nclouds--and the homesteads of a happy thriving peasantry--these are the\r\nthings I sigh for. A true English home-scene seems to me a thousand\r\ntimes more beautiful, as it must be a thousand times dearer than the\r\ngarish showy splendour of Naples.\"\r\n\r\nClorinda's thoughts crept back into her chilled heart; large tear-drops\r\nrose in her eyes, but she concealed them, and shrinking into a corner of\r\nthe carriage, she felt more lonely and deserted than she would have done\r\namong strangers who had loved Italy, and participated in her feelings.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at the inn called the Villa di Cicerone, at the Mola di\r\nGaeta. All the beauty of the most beautiful part of the Peninsula seems\r\nconcentered in that enchanting spot--the perfume of orange flowers\r\nfilled the air--the sea was at their feet--the vine-clad hills around.\r\nAll this excess of loveliness only added to the unutterable misery of\r\nthe Neapolitan girl. Her companions talked and laughed, while she felt\r\nher frame convulsed by internal combats, and the unwonted command she\r\nexercised over her habitual vehemence. Horatio conversed gaily with his\r\nsisters, till catching a glimpse of the pale face of his wretched wife,\r\nher mournful eyes and wasted cheeks, he drew near her. \"You are\r\nfatigued, dearest Clorinda,\" he said, \"will you not go to rest?\"\r\n\r\nHe said this in a tender caressing tone, but she felt, \"He wants to send\r\nme away--to get rid even of the sight of me.\" But he sat down by her,\r\nand perceiving her dejection, and guessing partly at its cause, he\r\nsoothed her, and talked of their return to her native land, and cheered\r\nher by expressions of gratitude for the sacrifice she was making. Her\r\nheart began to soften, and her tears to flow more freely, when a man\r\nentered, such as haunt the inns in Italy, and watch for the arrival of\r\nrich strangers to make profit in various ways out of them. This man had\r\na small picture for sale, which he declared to be an original Carlo\r\nDolce. It was the head of a seraph painted on copper--it was probably a\r\ncopy, but it was beautifully executed; besides the depth of colour and\r\ngrace of design, there was something singularly beautiful in the\r\nexpression of the countenance portrayed,--it symbolized happiness and\r\nlove; a beaming softness animated the whole face; a perfect joy, an\r\nineffable radiance shone out of it. Clorinda took it in her hand--the\r\nrepresentation of heart-felt gladness increased her self-pity; she was\r\nturning towards her husband with a reproachful look, thinking, \"Such\r\nsmiles you have banished from my face for ever,\"--when Sophia Saville,\r\nwho was looking over her shoulder, exclaimed, \"What an extraordinary\r\nresemblance! there was never any thing so like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who? what?\" asked her sister.\r\n\r\n\"It is Lady Lodore herself,\" replied Sophia; \"her eyes, her mouth, her very\r\nsmile.\"\r\n\r\nLucy gave a quick glance towards her brother. Horatio involuntarily\r\nstepped forward to look, and then as hastily drew back. Clorinda saw it\r\nall--she put down the picture, and left the room--she could not\r\nstay--she could not speak--she knew not what she felt, but that a fiery\r\ntorture was eating into her, and she must fly, she knew not whither.\r\nSaville was pained; he hesitated what to do or say--so he remained;\r\nsupper was brought in, and Clorinda not appearing, it was supposed that\r\nshe had retired to rest. In about an hour and a half after, Horatio went\r\ninto her room, and to his horror beheld her stretched upon the cold\r\nbricks of the chamber, senseless; the moon-beams rested on her pale\r\nface, which bore the hues of death. In a moment the house was alarmed,\r\nthe village doctor summoned, a courier dispatched to Naples for an\r\nEnglish physician, and every possible aid-afforded the wretched\r\nsufferer. She was placed on the bed,--she still lived; her faint pulse\r\ncould not be felt, and no blood flowed when a vein was opened, but she\r\ngroaned, and now and then opened her eyes with a ghastly stare, and\r\nclosed them again as if mechanically. All was horror and despair--no\r\nhelp--no resource presented itself; they hung round her, they listened\r\nto her groans with terror, and yet they were the only signs of life that\r\ndisturbed her death-like state. At last, soon after the dawn of day, she\r\nbecame convulsed, her pulse fluttered, and blood flowed from her wounded\r\narm; in about an hour from this time she gave birth to a dead child.\r\nAfter this she grew calmer and fainter. The physician arrived, but she\r\nwas past mortal cure,--she never opened her eyes more, nor spoke, nor\r\ngave any token of consciousness. By degrees her groans ceased, and she\r\nfaded into death: the slender manifestations of lingering vitality\r\ngradually decreasing till all was still and cold. After an hour or two\r\nher face resumed its loveliness, pale and wasted as it was: she seemed\r\nto sleep, and none could regret that repose possessed that heart, which\r\nhad been alive only to the deadliest throes of unhappy passion. Yet\r\nSaville did more than regret--he mourned her sincerely and deeply,--he\r\naccused himself of hard-heartedness,--he remembered what she was when he\r\nhad first seen her;--how full of animation, beauty, and love. He did not\r\nremember that she had perished the victim of uncontrolled passion; he\r\nfelt that she was his victim. He would have given worlds to restore her\r\nto life and enjoyment. What was a residence in England--the promises of\r\nambition--the pleasures of his native land--all that he could feel or\r\nknow, compared to the existence of one so young, so blessed with\r\nHeaven's choicest gifts of mind and person. She was his victim, and he\r\ncould never forgive himself.\r\n\r\nFor his father's and sisters' sake he subdued the expression of his\r\ngrief, for they also loved Clorinda, and were struck with sorrow at the\r\nsudden catastrophe. His strong mind, also, before long, mastered the\r\nfalse view he had taken of the cause of her death. He lamented her\r\ndeeply, but he did not give way to unavailing remorse, which was founded\r\non his sensibility, and not on any just cause for repentance. He turned\r\nall his thoughts to repairing her errors, rather than his own, by\r\ncherishing her child with redoubled fondness. The little girl was too\r\nyoung to feel her loss; she had always loved her father, and now she\r\nclung to his bosom and pressed her infant lips to his cheek, and by her\r\nplayfulness and caresses repaid him for the tenderness that he lavished\r\non her.\r\n\r\nAfter some weeks spent in the north of Italy he returned to England with\r\nher. Lord Maristow and his daughters were already there, and had gone to\r\nMaristow Castle. Saville took up his abode with his cousin Villiers. His\r\nsituation was new and strange. He found himself in the very abode of the\r\ndreaded Cornelia, yet she was away, unheard of, almost, it seemed,\r\nforgotten. Did he think of her as he saw the traces of by-gone scenes\r\naround? He played with his child--he secluded himself among his\r\nbooks--he talked with Ethel of what had happened since their parting,\r\nand reproached Villiers bitterly for not having applied to him in his\r\ndistress. But a kind of spell sealed the lips of each, and Lady Lodore, who\r\nwas the living spirit of the scene around--the creator of its peace and\r\nhappiness--seemed to have passed away from the memory of all. It was in\r\nappearance only. Not an hour, not a minute of the day passed, that did\r\nnot bring her idea to their minds, and Saville and Ethel each longed for\r\nthe word to be uttered by either, which would permit them to give\r\nexpression to the thoughts that so entirely possessed them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe music\r\nOf man's fair composition best accords,\r\nWhen 'tis in consort, not in single strains:\r\nMy heart has been untuned these many months,\r\nWanting her presence, in whose equal love\r\nTrue harmony consisted.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of September the whole party assembled at Maristow\r\nCastle. Even Mrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry was among the guests. She had not\r\nvisited Ethel in London, because she would not enter Lady Lodore's house,\r\nbut she had the true spinster's desire of seeing the baby, and thus\r\novercame her reluctance to quitting Longfield for a few weeks. Fanny Derham\r\nalso accompanied them, unable to deny Ethel's affectionate entreaties.\r\nFanny's situation had been beneficially changed. Sir Gilbert Derham,\r\nfinding that his granddaughter associated with people _in the world_, and\r\nbeing applied to by Lord Maristow, was induced to withdraw Mrs. Derham\r\nfrom her mean situation, and to settle a small fortune on each of her\r\nchildren. Fanny was too young, and too wedded to her platonic notions of\r\nthe supremacy of mind, to be fully aware of the invaluable advantages of\r\npecuniary independence for a woman. She fancied that she could enter on\r\nthe career--the only career permitted her sex--of servitude, and yet\r\npossess her soul in freedom and power. She had never, indeed, thought\r\nmuch of these things: life was, as it concerned herself, a system of\r\nwords only. As always happens to the young, she only knew suffering\r\nthrough her affections, and the real chain of life--its necessities and\r\ncares--and the sinister influences exercised by the bad passions of our\r\nfellow-creatures--had not yet begun to fetter her aspiring thoughts.\r\nBeautiful in her freedom, in her enthusiasm, and even in her learning,\r\nbut, above all, in the lively kindliness of her heart, she excited the\r\nwonder and commanded the affections of all. Saville had never seen any\r\none like her--she brought to his recollection his own young feelings\r\nbefore experience had lifted \"the painted veil which those who live call\r\nlife,\" or passion and sorrow had tamed the ardour of his mind; he looked\r\non her with admiration, and yet with compassion, wondering where and how\r\nthe evil spirit of the world would show its power to torment, and\r\nconquer the free soul of the disciple of wisdom.\r\n\r\nYet Saville's own mind was rather rebuked than tamed: he knew what\r\nsuffering was, yet he knew also how to endure it, and to turn it to\r\nadvantage, deriving thence lessons of fortitude, of forbearance, and\r\neven of hope. It was not, however, till the seal on his lips was taken\r\noff, and the name of Cornelia mentioned, that he became aware that the\r\nsame heart warmed his bosom, as had been the cause at once of such\r\nrapture and misery in former times. Yet even now he did not acknowledge\r\nto himself that he still loved, passionately, devotedly loved, Lady Lodore.\r\nThe image of the pale Clorinda stretched on the pavement--his\r\nvictim--still dwelt in his memory, and he made a sacrifice at her tomb\r\nof every living feeling of his own. He fancied, therefore, that he spoke\r\ncoldly of Cornelia, with speculation only, while in fact, at the very\r\nmention of her name a revulsion took place in his being--his eyes\r\nbrightened, his face beamed with animation, his very figure enlarged,\r\nhis heart was on fire within him. Villiers saw and appreciated these\r\ntokens of passion; but Ethel only perceived an interest in her mother,\r\nshared with herself, and was half angry that he made no professions of\r\nthe constancy of his attachment.\r\n\r\nStill, day after day, and soon, all day long, they talked of Lady Lodore.\r\nNone but a lover and a daughter could have adhered so pertinaciously to one\r\nsubject; and thus Saville and Ethel were often left to themselves, or\r\njoined only by Fanny. Fanny was very mysterious and alarming in what she\r\nsaid of her beautiful and interesting favourite. While Ethel lamented\r\nher mother's love of the continent, conjectured concerning her return,\r\nand dwelt on the pleasures of their future intercourse, Fanny shook her\r\nhead, and said, \"It was strange, very strange, that not one letter had\r\nyet reached them from her.\" She was asked to explain, but she could only\r\nsay, that when she last saw Lady Lodore, she was impressed by the idea\r\nthat all was not as it seemed. She tried to appear as if acting\r\naccording to the ordinary routine of life, and yet was evidently\r\nagitated by violent and irrepressible feeling. Her manner, she had\r\nherself fancied, to be calm, and yet it betrayed a wandering of thought,\r\na fear of being scrutinized, manifested in her repetition of the same\r\nphrases, and in the earnestness with which she made assurances\r\nconcerning matters of the most trivial import. This was all that Fanny\r\ncould say, but she was intimately persuaded of the correctness of her\r\nobservation, and lamented that she had not inquired further and\r\ndiscovered more. \"For,\" she said, \"the mystery, whatever it is, springs\r\nfrom the most honourable motives. There was nothing personal nor\r\nfrivolous in the feelings that mastered her;\" and Fanny feared that at\r\nthat very moment she was sacrificing herself to some project--some\r\ndetermination, which, while it benefited others, was injuring herself.\r\nEthel, with all her affection for her mother, was not persuaded of the\r\njustice of these suspicions, nor could be brought to acknowledge that\r\nthe mystery of Lady Lodore's absence was induced by any motives as\r\nstrange and forcible as those suggested by Fanny; but believed that her\r\nyoung friend was carried away by her own imagination and high-flown\r\nideas. Saville was operated differently upon. He became uneasy,\r\nthoughtful, restless: a thousand times he was on the point of setting\r\nout to find a clue to the mystery, and to discover the abode of the\r\nrunaway,--but he was restrained. It is usually supposed that women are\r\nalways under the influence of one sentiment, and if Lady Lodore acted\r\nunder the direction and for the sake of another, wherefore should\r\nSaville interfere? what right had he to investigate her secrets, and\r\ndisturb her arrangements?\r\n\r\nSeveral months passed. Mrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry returned to Longfield,\r\nand still the mystery concerning Ethel's mother continued, and the\r\nwonder increased, Soon after Christmas Mr. Gayland, who was also Lord\r\nMaristow's solicitor, came down to the Castle for a few days. He made\r\ninquiries concerning Lady Lodore, and was somewhat surprised at her strange\r\ndisappearance and protracted absence. He asked several questions, and\r\nseemed to form conclusions in his own mind; he excited the curiosity of\r\nall, yet restrained himself from satisfying it; he was evidently\r\ndisquieted by her unbroken silence, yet feared to betray the origin of\r\nhis uneasiness.\r\n\r\nWhile he remained curiosity was dominant: when he went he requested\r\nVilliers to be good enough to let him know if any thing should be heard\r\nof Lady Lodore. He asked this more than once, and required an absolute\r\npromise. After his departure, his questions, his manner, and his last\r\nwords recurred, exciting even more surprise than when he had been\r\npresent. Fanny brought forward all he said to support her own\r\nconjectures; a shadow of disquiet crossed Ethel's mind; she asked\r\nVilliers to take some steps to discover where her mother was, and on his\r\nrefusal argued earnestly, though vainly, to persuade him to comply.\r\nVilliers was actuated by the common-place maxim of not interfering with\r\nthe actions and projects of others. \"Lady Lodore is not a child,\" he\r\nsaid, \"she knows what she is about--has she not always avoided you,\r\nEthel? Why press yourself inopportunely upon her?\"\r\n\r\nBut Ethel was not now to be convinced by the repetition of these\r\narguments. She urged her mother's kindness and sacrifice; her having\r\ngiven up her home to them; her house still unclaimed by her, still at\r\ntheir disposal, and which contained so many things which must have been\r\nendeared by long use and habit, and the relinquishing of which showed\r\nsomething extraordinary in her motives. This was a woman's feeling, and\r\nmade little impression on Villiers--he was willing to praise and to\r\nthank Lady Lodore for her generosity and kindness, but he suspected nothing\r\nbeyond her acknowledged acts.\r\n\r\nSaville heard this disquisition; he wished Villiers to be convinced--he\r\nwas persuaded that Ethel was right--he was angry at his cousin's\r\nobstinacy--he was miserable at the idea that Cornelia should feel\r\nherself treated with neglect--that she should need protection and not\r\nhave it--that she should be alone, and not find assistance proffered,\r\nurged upon her. He mounted his horse and took a solitary ride,\r\nmeditating on these things--his imagination became heated, his soul on\r\nfire. He pictured Lady Lodore in solitude and desertion, and his heart\r\nboiled within him. Was she sick, and none near her?--was she dead, and her\r\ngrave unvisited and unknown? A lover's fancy is as creative as a poet's\r\nand when once it takes hold of any idea, it clings to it tenaciously. If\r\nit is thus even with ordinary minds, how much more with Saville, with\r\nall energy which was his characteristic, and the latent fire of love\r\nburning in his heart. His resolution was sudden, and acted on at once.\r\nHe turned his horse's head towards London. On reaching the nearest town,\r\nhe ordered a chaise and four post horses. He wrote a few hurried lines\r\nannouncing an absence of two or three days, and with the rapidity that\r\nalways attended the conception of his purposes and their execution, the\r\nnext morning, having travelled all night, he was in Mr. Gayland's\r\noffice, questioning that gentleman concerning Lady Lodore, and seeking\r\nfrom him all the light he could throw upon her long-continued and\r\nmysterious absence.\r\n\r\nMr. Gayland had promised Lady Lodore not to reveal her secret to Mr. or\r\nMrs. Villiers; but he felt himself free to communicate it to any other\r\nperson. He was very glad to get rid of the burden and even the\r\nresponsibility of being her sole confidant. He related all he knew to\r\nSaville, and the truth flashed on the lover's mind. His imagination\r\ncould not dupe him--he could conceive, and therefore believe in her\r\ngenerosity, her magnanimity. He had before, in some degree, divined the\r\ngreatness of mind of which Lady Lodore was capable; though as far as\r\nregarded himself, her pride, and his modesty, had deceived him. Now he\r\nbecame at once aware that Cornelia had beggared herself for Ethel's\r\nsake. She had disposed of her jointure, given up the residue of her\r\nincome, and wandered away, poor and alone, to avoid the discovery of the\r\nextent and consequences of her sacrifices. Saville left Mr. Gayland's\r\noffice with a bursting and a burning heart. At once he paid a warm\r\ntribute of admiration to her virtues, and acknowledged to himself his\r\nown passionate love. It became a duty, in his eyes, to respect, revere,\r\nadore one so generous and noble. He was proud of the selection his heart\r\nhad made, and of his constancy. \"My own Cornelia,\" such was his reverie,\r\n\"how express your merit and the admiration it deserves!--other people\r\ntalk of generosity, and friendship, and parental affection--but you\r\nmanifest a visible image of these things; and while others theorize, you\r\nembody in your actions all that can be imagined of glorious and\r\nangelic.\" He congratulated himself on being able to return to the\r\ngenuine sentiments of his heart, and in finding reality give sanction to\r\nthe idolatry of his soul.\r\n\r\nHe longed to pour out his feelings at her feet, and to plead the cause\r\nof his fidelity and affection, to read in her eyes whether she would see\r\na reward for her sufferings in his attachment. Where was she, to receive\r\nhis protestations and vows? He half forgot, in the fervour of his\r\nfeelings, that he knew not whither she had retreated, nor possessed any\r\nclue whereby to find her. He returned to Mr. Gayland to inquire from\r\nhim; but he could tell nothing; he went to her house and questioned the\r\nservants, they remembered nothings; at last he found her maid, and\r\nlearnt from her, where she was accustomed to hire her post-horses; this\r\nwas all the information at which he could arrive.\r\n\r\nGoing to Newman's, with some difficulty he found the post-boy, who\r\nremembered driving her. By his means he traced her to Reading, but here\r\nall clue was lost. The inn to which she had gone had passed into other\r\nhands, and no one knew any thing about the arrivals and departures of\r\nthe preceding summer. He made various perquisitions, and lighted by\r\nchance on the servant she had taken with her to Reading, and there\r\ndismissed. From what he said, and a variety of other circumstances, he\r\nbecame convinced that she had gone abroad. He searched the foreign\r\npassport-office, and found that one had been taken out at the French\r\nAmbassador's in the month of April, by a Mrs. Fitzhenry. He persuaded\r\nhimself that this was proof that she had gone to Paris. It was most\r\nprobable that, impoverished as she was, and desirous of concealing her\r\naltered situation, that she should, as Lodore had formerly done, dismiss a\r\ntitle which would at once encumber and betray her. He immediately\r\nresolved to cross to France. And yet for a moment he hesitated, and\r\nreflected on what it was best to do.\r\n\r\nHe had given no intimation of his proceedings to his cousin, and they\r\nwere unaware that his journey was connected with Lady Lodore. He had a\r\nlover's wish to find her himself--himself to be the only source of\r\nconsolation--the only mediator to restore her to her daughter and to\r\nhappiness. But his fruitless attempts at discovery made him see that his\r\nwishes were not to be effected easily. He felt that he ought to\r\ncommunicate all he knew to his cousins, and even to ensure their\r\nassistance in his researches. Before going abroad, therefore, he\r\nreturned to Maristow Castle.\r\n\r\nHe arrived late in the evening. Lord Maristow and his daughters were\r\ngone out to dinner. The three persons whom Saville especially wished to\r\nsee, alone occupied the drawing-room. Edward was writing to his father,\r\nwho had advised him, now that he had a son, entirely to cut off the\r\nentail and mortgage a great part of the property: it was a distasteful\r\ntask to answer the suggestions of unprincipled selfishness. While he was\r\nthus occupied, Ethel had taken from her desk her mother's last letter,\r\nand was reading it again and again, weighing every syllable, and\r\nendeavouring to discover a hidden meaning. She went over to the sofa on\r\nwhich Fanny was sitting, to communicate to her a new idea that had\r\nstruck her. The studious girl had got into a corner with her Cicero, and\r\nwas reading the Tusculan Questions, which she readily laid aside to\r\nenter on a subject so deeply interesting. Saville opened the door, and\r\nappeared most unexpectedly among them. His manner was eager and abrupt,\r\nand the first words he uttered were, \"I am come to disturb you all, and\r\nto beg of you to return to London:--no time must be lost--can you go\r\nto-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Villiers, \"if you wish it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why?\" asked Ethel.\r\n\r\n\"You have found Lady Lodore!\" exclaimed Fanny.\r\n\r\n\"You are dreaming, Fanny,\" said Ethel; \"you see Horace shakes his head.\r\nBut if we go to-morrow, yet rest to-night. You are fatigued, pale, and\r\nill, Horace--you have been exerting yourself too much--explain your\r\nwishes, but take repose and refreshment.\"\r\n\r\nSaville was in too excited a state to think of either. He repelled\r\nEthel's feminine offers, till he had related his story. His listeners\r\nheard him with amazement. Villiers's cheeks glowed with shame, partly at\r\nthe injustice of his former conduct--partly at being the object of so\r\nmuch sacrifice and beneficence on the part of his mother-in-law. Fanny's\r\ncolour also heightened; she clasped her hands in delight, mingling\r\nvarious exclamations with Saville's story. \"Did I not say so? I was sure\r\nof it. If you had seen her when I did, on the day of her going away, you\r\nwould have been as certain as I.\" Ethel wept in silence, her heart was\r\ntouched to the core, \"the remorse of love\" awakened in it. How cold and\r\nungrateful had been all her actions: engrossed by her love for her\r\nhusband, she had bestowed no sympathy, made no demonstrations towards\r\nher mother. The false shame and Edward's oft-repeated arguments which\r\nhad kept her back, vanished from her mind. She reproached herself\r\nbitterly for lukewarmness and neglect; she yearned to show her\r\nrepentance--to seek forgiveness--to express, however feebly, her sense\r\nof her mother's angelic goodness. Her tears flowed to think of these\r\nthings, and that her mother was away, poor and alone, believing herself\r\nwronged in all their thoughts, resenting perhaps their unkindness,\r\nmourning over the ingratitude of her child.\r\n\r\nWhen the first burst of feeling was over, they discussed their future\r\nproceedings. Saville communicated his discoveries and his plan of\r\ncrossing to France. Villiers was as eager as his cousin to exert himself\r\nactively in the pursuit. His ingenuous and feeling mind was struck by\r\nhis injustice, and he was earnest in his wish to atone for the past, and\r\nto recompense her, if possible, for her sacrifices. As every one is apt\r\nto do with regard to the ideas of others, he was not satisfied with his\r\ncousin's efforts or conclusions; he thought more questions might be\r\nasked--more learnt at the inns on the route which Lady Lodore had taken.\r\nThe passport Saville had imagined to be hers, was taken out for Dover.\r\nReading was far removed from any road to Kent. They argued this. Horatio\r\nwas not convinced; but while he was bent on proceeding to Paris, Edward\r\nresolved to visit Reading--to examine the neighbourhood--to requestion\r\nthe servants--to put on foot a system of inquiry which must in the end\r\nassure them whether she was still in the kingdom. It was at once\r\nresolved, that on the morrow they should go to London.\r\n\r\nThither they accordingly went. They repaired to Lady Lodore's house.\r\nSaville on the next morning departed for France, and a letter soon reached\r\nthem from him, saying, that he felt persuaded that the Mrs. Fitzhenry was\r\nLady Lodore, and that he should pursue his way with all speed to Paris.\r\nIt appeared, that the lady in question had crossed to Calais on the\r\neleventh of June, and intimated her design of going to the Bagneres de\r\nBigorre among the Pyrennees, passing through Paris on her way. The\r\nmention of the Bagneres de Bigorre clinched Saville's suspicions--it was\r\nsuch a place as one in Lady Lodore's position might select for her\r\nabode--distant, secluded, situated in sublime and beautiful scenery,\r\nsingularly cheap, and seldom visited by strangers; yet the annual resort\r\nof the French from Bordeaux and Lyons, civilized what otherwise had been\r\ntoo rude and wild for an English lady. It was a long journey\r\nthither--the less wonder that nothing was heard, or seen, or surmised\r\nconcerning the absentee by her numerous acquaintances, many of whom were\r\nscattered on the continent. Saville represented all these things, and\r\nexpressed his conviction that he should find her. His letter was brief,\r\nfor he was hurried, and he felt that it were better to say nothing than\r\nto express imperfectly the conflicting emotions alive in his heart. \"My\r\nlife seems a dream,\" he said at the conclusion of his letter; \"a long\r\npainful dream, since last I saw her. I awake, she is not here; I go to\r\nseek her--my actions have that single scope--my thoughts tend to that\r\naim only; I go to find her--to restore her to Ethel. If I succeed in\r\nbestowing this happiness on her, I shall have my reward, and, whatever\r\nhappens, no selfish regret shall tarnish my delight.\"\r\n\r\nHe urged Villiers, meanwhile, not to rely too entirely on the conviction\r\nso strong in himself, but to pursue his plan of discovery with vigour.\r\nVilliers needed no spur. His eagerness was fully alive; he could not\r\nrest till he had rescued his mother-in-law from solitude and obscurity.\r\nHe visited Reading; he extended his inquiries to Newbury: here more\r\nlight broke in on his researches. He heard of Lady Lodore's illness--of her\r\nhaving resided for several months at a villa in the neighbourhood, while\r\nslowly recovering from a fever by which for a long time her life had\r\nbeen endangered. He heard also of her departure, her return to London.\r\nThen again all was obscurity. The innkeepers and letters of post-horses\r\nin London, were all visited in vain--the mystery became as impenetrable\r\nas ever. It seemed most probable that she was living in some obscure\r\npart of the metropolis--Ethel's heart sunk within her at the thought.\r\n\r\nEdward wrote to Saville to communicate this intelligence, which put an\r\nend to the idea of her being in France--but he was already gone on to\r\nBagneres. He himself perambulated London and its outskirts, but all in\r\nvain. The very thought that she should be residing in a place so sad,\r\nnay, so humiliating, without one gilding circumstance to solace poverty\r\nand obscurity, was unspeakably painful both to Villiers and his wife.\r\nEthel thought of her own abode in Duke street during her husband's\r\nabsence, and how miserable and forlorn it had been--she now wept\r\nbitterly over her mother's fate; even Fanny's philosophy could not\r\nafford consolation for these ideas.\r\n\r\nAn accident, however, gave a new turn to their conjectures. In the draw\r\nof a work-table, Ethel found an advertisement cut out of a newspaper,\r\nsetting forth the merits of a cottage to be let near Rhaiyder Gowy in\r\nRadnorshire, and with this, a letter from the agent at Rhaiyder, dated\r\nthe 13th of May, in answer to inquiries concerning the rent and\r\nparticulars. The letter intimated, that if the account gave\r\nsatisfaction, the writer would get the cottage prepared for the tenant\r\nimmediately, and the lady might take possession at the time mentioned,\r\non the 1st of June. The day after finding this letter, Villiers set out\r\nfor Wales.\r\n\r\nBut first he persuaded Ethel to spend the interval of his absence at\r\nLongfield. She had lately fretted much concerning her mother, and as she\r\nwas still nursing her baby, Edward became uneasy at her pale cheeks and\r\nthinness. Ethel was anxious to preserve her health for her child; she\r\nfelt that her uneasiness and pining would be lessened by a removal into\r\nthe country. She was useless in London, and there was something in her\r\nresidence in her mother's house--in the aspect of the streets--in the\r\nmemory of what she had suffered there, and the fear that Lady Lodore was\r\nenduring a worse repetition of the same evils, that agitated and preyed\r\nupon her. Her aunt had pressed her very much to come and see her, and\r\nshe wrote to say, that she might be expected on the following day. She\r\nbade adieu to Villiers with more of hope with regard to his success than\r\nshe had formerly felt. She became half convinced that her mother was not\r\nin London. Fanny supported her in these ideas; they talked continually\r\nof all they knew--of the illness of Lady Lodore--of her firmness of\r\npurpose in not sending for her daughter, or altering her plans in\r\nconsequence; they comforted themselves that the air of Wales would\r\nrestore her health, and the beauty of the scenery and the freedom of\r\nnature sooth her mind. They were full of hope--of more--of expectation.\r\nEthel, indeed, had at one time proposed accompanying her husband, but\r\nshe yielded to his entreaties, and to the fear suggested, that she might\r\ninjure her child's health. Villiers's motions would be more prompt\r\nwithout her. They separated. Ethel wrote to Saville a letter to find him\r\nat Paris, containing an account of their new discoveries, and then\r\nprepared for her journey to Essex with Fanny, her baby, and the\r\nbeautiful little Clorinda Saville, who had been left under her care, on\r\nthe following day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not One who much or oft delights\r\nTo season my Friends with personal talk,--\r\nOf Friends who live within an easy walk,\r\nOr Neighbours, daily, weekly in my sight.\r\nAnd, for my chance acquaintance, Ladies bright.\r\nSons, Mothers, Maidens withering on the stalk,\r\nThese all wear out of me, like Forms, with chalk\r\nPainted on rich men's floors, for one feast-night.\r\n\r\nWORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry returned to Longfield from Maristow Castle at\r\nthe end of the month of November. She gladly came back, in all the\r\ndinginess and bleakness of that dismal season, to her beloved seclusion\r\nat Longfield. The weather was dreary, a black frost invested every thing\r\nwith its icy chains, the landscape looked disconsolate, and now and then\r\nwintry blasts brought on snow-storms, and howled loudly through the long\r\ndark nights. The amiable spinster drew her chair close to the fire; with\r\nhalf-shut eyes she contemplated the glowing embers, and recalled many past\r\nwinters just like this, when Lodore was alive and in America; or, diving\r\nyet deeper into memory, when the honoured chair she now occupied, had\r\nbeen dignified by her father, and she had tried to sooth his querulous\r\ncomplaints on the continued absence of her brother Henry. When, instead\r\nof these familiar thoughts, the novel ones of Ethel and Villiers\r\nintruded themselves, she rubbed her eyes to be quite sure that she did\r\nnot dream. It was a lamentable change; and who the cause? Even she whose\r\nabsence had been, she felt, wickedly lamented at Maristow Castle,\r\nCornelia Santerre--she, who in an evil hour, had become Lady Lodore, and\r\nwho would before God, answer for the disasters and untimely death of her\r\nill-fated husband.\r\n\r\nWith any but Mrs. Fitzhenry, such accusations had, after the softening\r\nprocess of time, been changed to an admission, that, despite her errors,\r\nLady Lodore had rather been misled and mistaken, than heinously faulty; and\r\nher last act, in sacrificing so much to her daughter, although the extent\r\nof her sacrifice was unknown to her sister-in-law, had cancelled her former\r\ndelinquencies. But the prejudiced old lady was not so easily mollified;\r\nshe was harsh alone towards her, but all the gall of her nature was\r\ncollected and expended on the head of her brother's widow. Probably an\r\ninstinctive feeling of her unreasonableness made her more violent. Her\r\nlanguage was bitter whenever she alluded to her--she rejoiced at her\r\nabsence, and instead of entering into Ethel's gratitude and impatience,\r\nshe fervently prayed that she might never appear on the scene again.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry was less of a gossip than any maiden lady who\r\nhad ever lived singly in the centre of a little village. Her heart was\r\nfull of the dead and the absent--of past events, and their long train of\r\nconsequences, so that the history of the inhabitants of her village,\r\npossessed no charm for her. If any one among them suffered from\r\nmisfortune she endeavoured to relieve them, and if any died, she lamented,\r\nmoralized on the passage of time, and talked of Lodore's death; but\r\nthe scandal, the marriages, the feuds, and wonderful things that came to\r\npass at Longfield, appeared childish and contemptible, the flickering of\r\nearth-born tapers compared to the splendour, the obscuration, and final\r\nsetting of the celestial luminary which had been the pole-star of her\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIt was from this reason that Mrs. Fitzhenry had not heard of the Lady\r\nwho lodged at Dame Nixon's cottage, in the Vale of Bewling, till the\r\ntime, when, after having exhausted the curiosity of Longfield, she was\r\nalmost forgotten. The Lady, she was known by no other name, had arrived\r\nin the town during Mrs. Fitzhenry's visit to Maristow castle. She had\r\narrived in her own chariot, unattended by any servant; the following day\r\nshe had taken up her abode at Dame Nixon's cottage, saying, that she was\r\nonly going to stay a week: she had continued there for more than three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nDame Nixon's cottage was situated about a mile and a half from\r\nLongfield. It stood alone in a little hollow embowered by trees; the\r\nground behind rose to a slight upland, and a rill trickled through the\r\ngarden. You got to it by a bye path, which no wheeled vehicle could\r\ntraverse, though a horse might, and it was indeed the very dingle and\r\ncottage which Ethel had praised during her visit into Essex in the\r\npreceding year. The silence and seclusion were in summer tranquillizing\r\nand beautiful; in winter sad and drear; the fields were swampy in wet\r\nweather, and in snow and frost it seemed cut off from the rest of the\r\nworld. Dame Nixon and her granddaughter lived there alone. The girl had\r\nbeen engaged to be married. Her lover jilted her, and wedded a richer\r\nbride. The story is so old, that it is to be wondered that women have\r\nnot ceased to lament so common an occurrence. Poor Margaret was, on the\r\ncontrary, struck to the heart--she despised herself for being unable to\r\npreserve her lover's affections, rather than the deceiver for his\r\ninfidelity. She neglected her personal appearance, nor ever showed\r\nherself among her former companions, except to support her grandmother\r\nto church. Her false lover sat in the adjoining pew. She fixed her eyes\r\non her Prayer-book during the service, and on the ground as she went\r\naway. She did not wish him to see the change which his faithlessness had\r\nwrought, for surely it would afflict him. Once there had not bloomed a\r\nfresher or gayer rose in the fields of Essex--now she had grown thin and\r\npale--her young light step had become slow and heavy--sickness and\r\nsorrow made her eyes hollow, and her cheeks sunken. She avoided every\r\none, devoting herself to attendance on her grandmother. Dame Nixon was\r\nnearly doting. Life was ebbing fast from her old frame; her best\r\npleasure was to sun herself in the garden in summer, or to bask before\r\nthe winter's fire. While enjoying these delights, her dimmed eyes\r\nbrightened, and a smile wreathed her withered lips; she said, \"Ah! this\r\nis comfortable;\" while her broken-hearted grandchild envied a state of\r\nbeing which could content itself with mere animal enjoyment. They were\r\nvery poor. Margaret had to work hard; but the thoughts of the head, or,\r\nat least, the feelings of the heart, need not wait on the labour of the\r\nhands. The Sunday visit to church kept alive her pain; her very prayers\r\nwere bitter, breathed close to the deceiver and her who had usurped her\r\nhappiness: the memory and anticipation haunted her through the week; she\r\nwas often blinded by tears as she patiently pursued her household\r\nduties, or her toil in their little garden. Her hands were hardened with\r\nwork, her throat, her face sunburnt; but exercise and occupation did not\r\nprevent her from wasting away, or her cheek from becoming sunk and wan.\r\n\r\nDame Nixon's cottage was poor but roomy; some years before, a gentleman\r\nfrom London had, in a freak, hired two rooms in it, and furnished them.\r\nSince then, she had sometimes let them, and now they were occupied by\r\nthe stranger lady. At first all three of the inhabitants appeared each\r\nSunday at church. The Lady was dressed in spotless and simple white, and\r\nso closely veiled, that no one could see her face; of course she was\r\nbeautiful. Soon after Mrs. Elizabeth's return from Maristow Castle, it\r\nwas discovered that first the lady stayed away, and soon, that the whole\r\nparty absented themselves on Sunday; and as this defalcation demanded\r\ninquiry, it was discovered that a pony chaise took them three miles off\r\nto the church of the nearest village. This was a singular and yet a\r\nbeneficial change. The false swain must rejoice at losing sight of the\r\nmemento of his sin, and Margaret would certainly pray with a freer\r\nheart, when she no longer shrunk from his gaze and that of his wife.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the end of January that Mrs. Elizabeth heard of the\r\nLady; it was not till the beginning of February that she asked a single\r\nquestion about her.\r\n\r\nIn January, passing the inn-yard, the curate's wife, who was walking\r\nwith her, said, \"There is the chariot belonging to the Lady who lodges\r\nat dame Nixon's cottage. I wonder who she is. The arms are painted out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, dame Nixon has a lodger then; that is a good thing, it will help\r\nher through the winter. I have not seen her or her daughter at church\r\nlately.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the other, \"they go now to Bewling church.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to hear it,\" said Mrs. Fitzhenry; \"it is much better for poor\r\nMargaret not to come here.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation went on, and the Lady was alluded to, but no questions\r\nwere asked or curiosity excited. In February she heard from the doctor's\r\nwife, that the doctor had been to the cottage, and that the Lady was\r\nindisposed. She heard at the same time that this Lady had refused to\r\nreceive the visits of the curate's lady and the doctor's lady--excusing\r\nherself, that she was going to leave Essex immediately. This had\r\nhappened two months before. On hearing of her illness, Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nthought of calling on her, but this stopped her. \"It is very odd,\" said\r\nthe doctor's wife, \"she came in her own carriage, and yet has no\r\nservants. She lives in as poor a way as can be, down in that cottage,\r\nyet my husband says she is more like the Queen of England in her looks\r\nand ways than any one he ever saw.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like the Queen of England?\" said Mrs. Fitzhenry, \"What queen?--Queen\r\nCharlotte?\" who had been the queen of the greater part of the good\r\nlady's life.\r\n\r\n\"She is as young and beautiful as an angel,\" said the other, half angry;\r\n\"it is very mysterious. She did not look downcast like, as if any thing\r\nwas wrong, but was as cheerful and condescending as could be.\r\n'Condescending, Doctor,' said I, for my husband used the word; 'you\r\ndon't want condescension from a poor body lodging at dame Nixon's.'--'A\r\npoor body!' said he, in a huff, 'she is more of a lady, indeed more like\r\nthe Queen of England than any rich body you ever saw.' And what is odd,\r\nno one knows her name--Dame Nixon and Margaret always call her Lady--the\r\nvery marks are picked out from her pocket handkerchiefs. Yet I did hear\r\nthat there was a coronet plain to be seen on one--a thing impossible\r\nunless she was a poor cast-away; and the doctor says he'd lay his life\r\nthat she was nothing of that. He must know her name when he makes out\r\nher bill, and I told him to ask it plump, but he puts off, and puts off,\r\ntill I am out of all patience.\"\r\n\r\nA misty confused sense of discomfort stole over Mrs. Elizabeth when she\r\nheard of the coronet in the corner of the pocket handkerchief, but it\r\npassed away without suggesting any distinct idea to her mind. Nor did\r\nshe feel curiosity about the stranger--she was too much accustomed to\r\nthe astonishment, the conjectures, the gossip of Longfield, to suppose\r\nthat there was any real foundation for surprise, because its\r\nwonder-loving inhabitants choose to build up a mystery out of every\r\ncommon occurrence of life.\r\n\r\nThis absence of inquisitiveness must long have kept Mrs. Fitzhenry in\r\nignorance of who her neighbour was, and the inhabitants of Longfield\r\nwould probably have discovered it before her, had not the truth been\r\nrevealed even before she entertained a suspicion that there was any\r\nsecret to be found out.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, ma'am,\" said her maid to her one evening, as she was\r\nsuperintending the couch\u00e9e of the worthy spinster, \"I think you ought\r\nto know, though I am afraid you may be angry.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman hesitated; her mistress encouraged her. \"If it is any thing I\r\nought to know, Wilmot, tell it at once, and don't be afraid. What has\r\nhappened to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"To me, ma'am,--la! nothing,\" replied the maid; \"it's something about\r\nthe Lady at dame Nixon's, only you commanded me never to speak the name\r\nof----\"\r\n\r\nAnd again the good woman stopped short. Mrs. Fitzhenry, a little\r\nsurprised, and somewhat angry, bade her go on. At length, in plain words\r\nshe was told:\r\n\r\n\"Why, ma'am, the Lady down in the Vale is no other than my lady--than\r\nLady Lodore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ridiculous--who told you so?\"\r\n\r\n\"My own eyes, ma'am; I shouldn't have believed any thing else. I saw the\r\nLady, and it was my Lady, as sure as I stand here.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how could you know her? it is years since you saw her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" said the woman, with a smile of superiority; \"but it is\r\nnot easy to forget Lady Lodore. See her yourself, ma'am,--you will know\r\nthen that I am right.\"\r\n\r\nWilmot had lived twenty years with Mrs. Fitzhenry. She had visited town\r\nwith her at the time of Ethel's christening. She had been kept in\r\nvexatious ignorance of subsequent events, till the period of the visit\r\nof her mistress and niece to London two years before, when she\r\nindemnified herself. Through the servants of Villiers, and of the Misses\r\nSaville, she had learnt a vast deal; and not satisfied with mere\r\nhearsay, she had seen Lady Lodore several times getting into her carriage\r\nat her own door, and had even been into her house: such energy is there in\r\na liberal curiosity. The same disinterested feeling had caused her to go\r\ndown to dame Nixon's with an offer from her mistress of service to the\r\nLady, hearing she was ill. She went perfectly unsuspicious of the\r\nwonderful discovery she was about to make, and was thus rewarded beyond\r\nher most sanguine hopes, by being in possession of a secret, known to\r\nherself alone. The keeping of a secret is, however, a post of no honour\r\nif all knowledge be confined to the possessor alone. Mrs. Wilmot was\r\ntolerably faithful, with all her love of knowledge; she was sure it\r\nwould vex her mistress if Lady Lodore's strange place of abode were\r\nknown at Longfield, and Mrs. Fitzhenry was consequently the first person\r\nto whom she had hinted the fact. All this account she detailed with\r\ngreat volubility. Her mistress recommended discretion most earnestly;\r\nand at the same time expressed a doubt whether her information was\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would go and judge for yourself, ma'am,\" said the maid.\r\n\r\n\"God forbid!\" exclaimed Mrs. Fitzhenry. \"God grant I never see Lady\r\nLodore again! She will go soon. You tell me that dame Nixon says she is\r\nonly staying till she is well. She will go soon, and it need never be\r\nknown, except to ourselves, Wilmot, that she was ever here.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a dignity in this eternal mystery that somewhat compensated\r\nfor the absence of wonder and fuss which the woman had anticipated with\r\nintense pleasure. She assured her mistress, over and over again, of her\r\nsecrecy and discretion, and was dismissed with the exhortation to forget\r\nall she had learnt as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore did she come here? what can she be doing?\" Mrs. Fitzhenry\r\nasked herself over and over again. She could not guess. It was strange,\r\nit was mysterious, and some mischief was at the bottom--but she would go\r\nsoon--\"would that she were already gone!\"\r\n\r\nIt must be mentioned that Mrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry had left Maristow\r\nCastle before the arrival of Mr. Gayland, and had therefore no knowledge\r\nof the still more mysterious cloud that enveloped Lady Lodore's absence.\r\nIgnorant of her self-destroying sacrifices and generosity, her pity was\r\nnot excited, her feelings were all against her. She counted the days as\r\nthey passed, and looked wistfully at Wilmot, hoping that she would\r\nquickly bring tidings of the Lady's departure. In vain; the doctor\r\nceased to visit the cottage, but the Lady remained. All at once the\r\ndoctor visited it again with greater assiduity than ever--not on account\r\nof his beautiful patient--but Dame Nixon had had a paralytic stroke, and\r\nthe kind Lady had sent for him, and promised to defray all the expenses\r\nof the poor woman's illness.\r\n\r\nAll this was truly vexatious. Mrs. Fitzhenry fretted, and even asked\r\nWilmot questions, but the unwelcome visitor was still there. Wherefore?\r\nWhat could have put so disagreeable a whim into her head? The good lady\r\ncould think of no motive, while she considered her presence an insult.\r\nShe was still more annoyed when she received a letter from Ethel. It had\r\nbeen proposed that Mr. and Mrs. Villiers should pay her a visit in the\r\nspring; but now Ethel wrote to say that she might be immediately\r\nexpected. \"I have strange things to tell you about my dear mother,\"\r\nwrote Ethel; \"it is very uncertain where she is. Horatio can hear\r\nnothing of her at Paris, and will soon return. Edward is going to Wales,\r\nas there seems a great likelihood that she has secluded herself there.\r\nWhile he is away you may expect me. I shall not be able to stay long--he\r\nwill come at the end of a week to fetch me.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Fitzhenry shuddered. Her prejudices were stronger than ever. She\r\nexperienced the utmost wretchedness from the idea that the residence of\r\nLady Lodore would be discovered, and a family union effected. It seemed\r\ndesecration to the memory of her brother, ruin to Ethel--the greatest\r\nmisfortune that could befal any of them. Her feelings were exaggerated,\r\nbut they were on that account the more powerful. How could she avert the\r\nevil?--a remedy must be sought, and she fixed on one--a desperate one,\r\nin truth, which appeared to her the sole mode of saving them all from\r\nthe greatest disasters.\r\n\r\nShe resolved to visit Lady Lodore; to represent to her the impropriety and\r\nwickedness of her having any intercourse with her daughter, and to\r\nentreat her to depart before Ethel's arrival. Her violence might almost\r\nseem madness; but all people who live in solitude become to a certain\r\ndegree insane. Their views of things are not corrected by comparing them\r\nwith those of others; and the strangest want of proportion always reigns\r\nin their ideas and sentiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nSo loth we part from all we love,\r\nFrom all the links that bind us;\r\nSo turn our hearts, where'er we rove,\r\nTo those we've left behind us.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Mrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry drove to the Vale of\r\nBewling. It was the last day of February. The March winds were hushed as\r\nyet; the breezes were balmy, the sunshine cheerful; a few soft clouds\r\nflecked the heavens, and the blue sky appeared between them calm and\r\npure. Each passing air breathed life and happiness--it caressed the\r\ncheek--and the swelling buds of the trees felt its quickening influence.\r\nThe almond-trees were in bloom--the pear blossoms began to whiten--the\r\ntender green of the young leaves showed themselves here and there among\r\nthe hedges. The old lady felt the cheering influence, and would have\r\nbecome even gay, had not the idea of the errand she was on checked her\r\nspirits. Sometimes the remembrance that she was really going to see her\r\nsister-in-law absolutely startled her; once or twice she thought of\r\nturning back; she passed through the lanes, and then alighting from her\r\ncarriage, walked by a raised foot-way, across some arable fields--and\r\nagain through a little grove; the winding path made a turn, and dame\r\nNixon's white, low-roofed cottage was before her. Every thing about it\r\nlooked trim, but very humble: and it was unadorned during this early\r\nseason by the luxury of flowers and plants, which usually give even an\r\nappearance of elegance to an English cottage. Mrs. Fitzhenry opened the\r\nlittle gate--her knees trembled as she walked through the scanty garden,\r\nwhich breathed of the new-sprung violets. The entrance to the cottage\r\nwas by the kitchen: she entered this, and found Margaret occupied by a\r\nculinary preparation for her grandmother. Mrs. Fitzhenry asked after the\r\nold woman's health, and thus gained a little time. Margaret answered in\r\nher own former quiet yet cheerful voice; she was changed from what she\r\nhad been a few weeks before. The bloom had not returned to her cheeks,\r\nbut they no longer appeared streaked with deathly paleness; her motions\r\nhad lost the heaviness that showed a mind ill at ease. Mrs. Elizabeth\r\ncongratulated her on the restoration of her health.\r\n\r\n\"O yes,\" she replied, with a blush, \"I am not the same creature I used\r\nto be, thank God, and the angel he has sent us here;--if my poor\r\ngrandmother would but get well I should be quite happy; but that is\r\nasking too much at her time of life.\"\r\n\r\nThe old lady made no further observations: she did not wish to hear the\r\npraises of her sister-in-law. \"Your lodger is still here?\" at length she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, God be praised!\" replied Margaret.\r\n\r\n\"Will you give her my compliments, and say I am here, and that I wish to\r\nsee her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" said Margaret; \"only the lady has refused to see any one,\r\nand she does not like being asked.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish to be impertinent or intrusive,\" answered Mrs. Elizabeth;\r\n\"only tell her my name, and if she makes any objection, of course she\r\nwill do as she likes. Where is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is sitting with my poor grandmother; the nurse--Heaven bless her!\r\nshe would hire a nurse, to spare me, as she said--is lain down to sleep,\r\nand she said she would watch by grandmother while I got the gruel; but\r\nit's ready now, and I will go and tell her.\"\r\n\r\nAway tripped Margaret, leaving her guest lost in wonder. Lady Lodore\r\nwatching the sick-bed of an old cottager--Lady Lodore immured in a\r\npoverty-stricken abode, fit only for the poorer sort of country people.\r\nIt was more than strange, it was miraculous. \"Yet she refused to\r\naccompany poor Henry to America! there must be some strange mystery in\r\nall this, that does not tell well for her.\"\r\n\r\nSo bitterly uncharitable was the unforgiving old lady towards her\r\nbrother's widow. She ruminated on these things for a minute or two, and\r\nthen Margaret came to usher her into the wicked one's presence. The\r\nsitting-room destined for the lodger was neat, though very plain. The\r\nwalls were wainscotted and painted white,--the windows small and\r\nlatticed,--the furniture was old black, shining mahogany; the chairs\r\nhigh-backed and clumsy; the table heavy and incommodious; the fire-place\r\nlarge and airy; and the shelf of the mantel-piece almost as high as the\r\nlow ceiling: there were a few things of a more modern construction; a\r\ncomfortable sofa, a rose-wood bureau and large folding screen; near the\r\nfire was a large easy chair of Gillows's manufacture, two light cane\r\nones, and two small tables; vases filled with hyacinths, jonquils, and\r\nother spring flowers stood on one, and an embroidery frame occupied the\r\nother. There was a perfume of fresh-gathered flowers in the room, which\r\nthe open window rendered very agreeable. Lady Lodore was standing near the\r\nfire--(for Wilmot was not mistaken, and it was she indeed who now\r\npresented herself to Mrs. Fitzhenry's eyes)--she might be agitated--she\r\ndid not show it--she came forward and held out her hand. \"Dear Bessy,\"\r\nshe said, \"you are very kind to visit me; I thank you very much.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor recluse was overpowered. The cordiality of the greeting\r\nfrightened her: she who had come full of bitter reproach and hard\r\npurposes, to be thanked with that sweet voice and smile. \"I thought,\" at\r\nlength she stammered out, \"that you did not wish to be known. I am glad\r\nyou are not offended, Cornelia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Offended by kindness? O no! It is true I did not wish--I do not wish\r\nthat it should be known that I am here--but since, by some strange\r\naccident, you have discovered me, how can I help being grateful for your\r\nvisit? I am indeed glad to see you; it is so long since I have heard any\r\nthing. Ah! dear Bessy, tell me, how is Ethel?\"\r\n\r\nTears glistened in the mother's eyes: she asked many questions, and Mrs.\r\nFitzhenry a little recovered her self-possession, as she answered them.\r\nShe looked at Lady Lodore--she was changed--she could not fail of being\r\nchanged after so many years,--she was no longer a beautiful girl, but\r\nshe was a lovely woman. Despite the traces of years, which however\r\nlightly they impressed, yet might be discerned; expression so\r\nembellished her that it was impossible not to admire; brilliancy had\r\ngiven place to softness, animation to serenity; still she was\r\nfair--still her silken hair clustered on her brow, and her sweet eyes\r\nwere full of fire; her smile had more than its former charm--it came\r\nfrom the heart.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fitzhenry was not, however, to be subdued by a little outward show.\r\nShe was there, who had betrayed and deserted (such were the energetic\r\nwords she was accustomed to employ) the noble, broken-hearted Lodore. The\r\nthought steeled her purpose, and she contrived at last to ask whether\r\nLady Lodore was going to remain much longer in Essex?\r\n\r\n\"I have been going every day since I came here. In a few weeks I shall\r\ncertainly be gone. Why do you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I thought--that is--you have made a secret of your being here,\r\nand I expect Ethel in a day or two, and she would certainly discover\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should she not?\" asked Lady Lodore. \"Why should you be averse to my\r\nseeing Ethel?\"\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to say a disagreeable thing, especially to one\r\nunaccustomed to society, and who is quite ignorant of the art of\r\nconcealing the sting of her intentions by flowery words. Mrs. Fitzhenry\r\nsaid something about her sister-in-law's own wishes, and the desire\r\nexpressed by Lodore that there should be no intercourse between the mother\r\nand daughter.\r\n\r\nCornelia's eyes flashed fire--\"Am I,\" she exclaimed, \"to be always the\r\nsacrifice? Is my husband's vengeance to pursue me beyond his grave--even\r\ntill I reach mine? Unjust as he was, he would not have desired this.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth coloured with anger. Lady Lodore continued--\"Pardon me,\r\nBessy, I do not wish to say any thing annoying to you or in blame of\r\nLodore. God knows I did him great wrong--but--\"\r\n\r\n\"O Cornelia,\" cried the old lady, \"do you indeed acknowledge that you\r\nwere to blame?\"\r\n\r\nLady Lodore smiled, and said, \"I were strangely blind to the defects of my\r\nown character, and to the consequences of my actions, were I not conscious\r\nof my errors; but retrospection is useless, and the punishment has\r\nbeen--is--sufficiently severe. Lodore himself would not have perpetuated\r\nhis resentment, had he lived only a very little while longer. But I will\r\nspeak frankly to you, Bessy, as frankly as I may, and you shall decide\r\non my further stay here. From circumstances which it is immaterial to\r\nexplain, I have resolved on retiring into absolute solitude. I shall\r\nnever live in London again--never again see any of my old friends and\r\nacquaintances. The course of my life is entirely changed; and whether I\r\nlive here or elsewhere, I shall live in obscurity and poverty. I do not\r\nwish Ethel to know this. She would wish to assist me, and she has\r\nscarcely enough for herself. I do not like being a burthen--I do not\r\nlike being pitied--I do not like being argued with, or to have my\r\nactions commented upon. You know that my disposition was always\r\nindependent.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth assented with a sigh, casting up her eyes to heaven.\r\n\r\nLady Lodore smiled, and went on. \"You think this is a strange place for me\r\nto live in: whether here or elsewhere, I shall never live in any better: I\r\nshall be fortunate if I find myself as well off when I leave Essex, for\r\nthe people here are good and honest, and the poor girl loves me,--it is\r\nalways pleasant to be loved.\"\r\n\r\nA tear again filled Cornelia's eyes--she tried to animate herself to\r\nsmile. \"I have nothing to love in all the wide world except Ethel; I do\r\nlove her; every one must love her--she is so gentle--so kind--so\r\nwarm-hearted and beautiful,--I love her more than my own heart's blood;\r\nshe is my child--part of that blood--part of myself--the better part; I\r\nhave seen little of her, but every look and word is engraved on my\r\nheart. I love her voice--her smiles--the pressure of her soft white\r\nhand. Pity me, dear Bessy, I am never to see any of these, which are all\r\nthat I love on earth, again. This idea fills me with regret--with\r\nworse--with sorrow. There is a grave not far from here which contains\r\none you loved beyond all others,--what would you not give to see him\r\nalive once again? To visit his tomb is a consolation to you. I must not\r\nseen even the walls within which my blessed child lives. You alone can\r\nhelp me--can be of comfort to me. Do not refuse--do not send me away. If\r\nI leave this place, I shall go to some secluded nook in Wales, and be\r\nquite--quite alone; the sun will shine, and the grass will grow at my\r\nfeet, but my heart will be dead within me, and I shall pine and die. I\r\nhave intended to do this; I have waited only till the sufferings of the\r\npoor woman here should be at an end, that I may be of service to\r\nMargaret, and then go. Your visit, which I fancied meant in kindness,\r\nhas put other thoughts into my head.\r\n\r\n\"Do not object to my staying here; let me remain; and do yet more for\r\nme--come to me sometimes, and bring me tidings of my daughter--tell me\r\nwhat she says--how she looks,--tell me that she is at each moment well\r\nand happy. Ah! do this, dear Bessy, and I will bless you. I shall never\r\nsee her--at least not for years; there are many things to prevent it:\r\nyet how could I drag out those years quite estranged from her? My heart\r\nhas died within me each time I have thought of it. But I can live as I\r\nsay; I shall expect you every now and then to come and talk to me of\r\nher; she need never know that I am so near--she comes so seldom to\r\nEssex. I shall soon be forgotten at Longfield. Will you consent? you\r\nwill do a kind action, and God will bless you.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Fitzhenry was one of those persons who always find it difficult to\r\nsay, No; and Lady Lodore asked with so much earnestness that she commanded;\r\nshe felt that her request ought to be granted, and therefore it was\r\nimpossible to refuse it. Before she well knew what she had said, the\r\ngood lady had yielded her consent and received her sister-in-law's warm\r\nand heart-felt thanks.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fitzhenry looked round the room: \"But how can you think of staying\r\nhere, Cornelia?\" she said; \"this place is not fit for you. I should have\r\nthought that you could never have endured such homely rooms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think them so bad?\" replied the lady; \"I think them very\r\npleasant, for I have done with pride, and I find peace and comfort here.\r\nLook,\" she continued, throwing open a door that led into the garden, \"is\r\nnot that delightful? This garden is very pretty: that clear rivulet\r\nmurmurs by with so lulling a sound;--and look at these violets, are they\r\nnot beautiful? I have planted a great many flowers, and they will soon\r\ncome up. Do you not know how pleasant it is to watch the shrubs we\r\nplant, and water, and rear ourselves?--to see the little green shoots\r\npeep out, and the leaves unfold, and then the flower blossom and expand,\r\ndiffusing its delicious odour around,--all, as it were, created by\r\noneself, by one's own nursing, out of a bit of stick or an ugly bulb?\r\nThis place is very pretty, I assure you: when the leaves are on the\r\ntrees they make a bower, and the grove behind the house is shady, and\r\nleads to lanes and fields more beautiful than any I ever saw. I have\r\nloitered for hours in this garden, and been quite happy. Now I shall be\r\nhappier than ever, thanks to you. You will not forget me. Come as often\r\nas you can. You say that you expect Ethel soon?\"\r\n\r\nLady Ladore walked with her sister-in-law to the garden-gate, and\r\nbeyond, through the little copse, still talking of her daughter. \"I\r\ncannot go further,\" she said, at last, \"without a bonnet--so good-bye,\r\ndear Bessy. Come soon. Thank you--thank you for this visit.\"\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand: Mrs. Fitzhenry took it, pressed it, a half\r\nfeeling came over her as if she were about to kiss the check of her\r\noffending relative, but her heart hardened, she blushed, and muttering\r\na hasty good-bye, she hurried away. She was bewildered, and after\r\nwalking a few steps, she turned round, and saw again the white dress of\r\nCornelia, as a turn in the path hid her. The grand, the exclusive Lady\r\nLodore--the haughty, fashionable, worldly-heartless wife thus metamorphosed\r\ninto a tender-hearted mother--suing to her for crumbs of charitable\r\nlove--and hiding all her boasted advantages in that low-roofed cottage!\r\nWhat could it all mean?\r\n\r\nMrs. Fitzhenry walked on. Again she thought, \"How odd! I went there,\r\ndetermining to persuade her to go away, and miserable at the thoughts of\r\nseeing her only once; and now I have promised to visit her often, and\r\nagreed that she shall live here. Have I not done wrong? What would my\r\npoor brother say? Yet I could not refuse. Poor thing! how could I\r\nrefuse, when she said that she had nothing else to live for? Besides, to\r\ngo away and live alone in Wales--it would be too dreadful; and she\r\nthanked me as if she were so grateful. I hope I have not done wrong.\r\n\r\n\"But how strange it is that Henry's widow should have become so poor;\r\nshe has given up a part of her income to Ethel, but a great deal\r\nremains. What can she have done with it? She is mysterious, and there is\r\nnever any good in mystery. Who knows what she may have to conceal?\" Mrs.\r\nElizabeth got in her carriage, and each step of the horses took her\r\nfarther from the web of enchantment which Cornelia had thrown over her.\r\n\"She is always strange,\"--thus ran her meditations; \"and how am I to see\r\nher, and no one find it out? and what a story for Longfield, that Lady\r\nLodore should be living in poverty in dame Nixon's cottage. I forgot to\r\ntell her that--I forgot to say so many things I meant to say--I don't know\r\nwhy, except that she talked so much, and I did not know how to bring in\r\nmy objections. But it cannot be right: and Ethel in her long rambles and\r\nrides with Miss Derham or Mr. Villiers, will be sure to find her out. I\r\nwish I had not seen her--I will write and tell her I have changed my\r\nmind, and entreat her to go away.\"\r\n\r\nAs it occurs to all really good-natured persons, it was very\r\ndisagreeable to Mrs. Fitzhenry to be angry, and she visited the\r\nill-temper so engendered on the head of poor Cornelia. She disturbed\r\nherself by the idea of all the disagreeable things that might happen--of\r\nher sister-in-law's positive refusal to go; the very wording which she\r\nimagined for her intended letter puzzled and irritated her. She no\r\nlonger felt the breath of spring as pleasant, but sat back in the\r\nchariot, \"nursing her wrath to keep it warm.\" When she reached her home,\r\nEthel's carriage was at her door.\r\n\r\nThe meeting, as ever, between aunt and niece was affectionate. Fanny was\r\nwelcomed, the baby was kissed, and little Clorinda admired, but the\r\ntheme nearest Ethel's heart was speedily introduced--her mother. The\r\ndisquietudes she felt on her account--Mr. Saville's journey to\r\nParis--the visit of Villiers to Wales to discover her place of\r\nconcealment--the inutility of all their endeavours.\r\n\r\n\"But why are they so anxious?\" asked her aunt; \"I can understand you:\r\nyou have some fantastic notion about your mother, but how can Mr.\r\nVilliers desire so very much to find her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could almost say,\" said Ethel, \"that Edward is more eager than\r\nmyself, though I should wrong my own affection and gratitude; but he was\r\nmore unjust towards her, and thus he feels the weight of obligation more\r\nkeenly; but, perhaps, dear aunt, you do not know all that my dearest\r\nmother has done for us--the unparalleled sacrifices she has made.\"\r\n\r\nThen Ethel went on to tell her all that Mr. Gayland had\r\ncommunicated--the sale of her jointure--the very small residue of money\r\nshe had kept for herself--the entire payment of Villiers's debts--and\r\nafterwards the surrender of the remainder of her income and of her house\r\nto them. Her eyes glistened as she spoke; her heart, overflowing with\r\nadmiration and affection, shone in her beautiful face, her voice was\r\npregnant with sensibility, and her expressions full of deep feeling.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth's heart was not of stone--far from it; it was, except in\r\nthe one instance of her sister-in-law, made of pliable materials. She\r\nheard Ethel's story--she caught by sympathy the tenderness and pity she\r\npoured forth--she thought of Lady Lodore at the cottage, a dwelling so\r\nunlike any she had ever inhabited before--poverty-stricken and mean; she\r\nremembered her praises of it--her cheerfulness--the simplicity of taste\r\nwhich she displayed--the light-hearted content with which she spoke of\r\nevery privation except the absence of Ethel. What before was mysterious\r\nwrong, was now manifest heroism. The loftiness and generosity of her\r\nmind rose upon the old lady unclouded; her own uncharitable deductions\r\nstung her with remorse; she continued to listen, and Ethel to narrate,\r\nand the big tears gathered in her eyes, and rolled down her venerable\r\ncheeks,--tears at once of repentance and admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nRepentance is a tender sprite;\r\nIf aught on earth have heavenly might,\r\n'Tis lodged within her silent tear.\r\n\r\nWORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry was not herself aware of all that Lady Lodore had\r\nsuffered, or the extent of her sacrifices. She guessed darkly at them,\r\nbut it was the detail that rendered them so painful, and, but for their\r\nmotive, humiliating to one nursed in luxury, and accustomed to all those\r\nintermediate servitors and circumstances, which stand between the rich\r\nand the bare outside of the working-day world. Cornelia shrunk from the\r\naddress of those she did not know, and from the petty acts of daily\r\nlife, which had gone on before without her entering into their detail.\r\n\r\nHer illness at Newbury had been severe. She was attacked by the scarlet\r\nfever; the doctor had ordered her to be removed from the bustle of the\r\ninn, and a furnished villa had been taken for her, while she could only\r\ngive a languid assent to propositions which she understood confusedly.\r\nShe was a long time very ill--a long time weak and slowly convalescent.\r\nAt length health dawned on her, accompanied by a disposition attuned to\r\ncontent and a wish for tranquillity. Her residence was retired,\r\ncommodious, and pretty; she was pleased with it, she did not wish to\r\nremove, and was glad to procrastinate from day to day any consideration\r\nof the future. Thus it was a long time before the strength of her\r\nthoughts and purposes was renewed, or that she began to think seriously\r\nof where she was, and what she was going to do.\r\n\r\nDuring the half delirium, the disturbed and uncontrollable, but not\r\nunmeaning reveries, of her fever, the idea of visiting Lodore's grave had\r\nhaunted her pertinaciously. She had often dreamt of it: at one time the\r\ntomb seemed to rise in a lonely desert; and the dead slept peacefully\r\nbeneath sunshine or starlight. At another, storms and howling winds were\r\naround, groans and sighs, mingled with the sound of the tempest, and\r\nmenaces and reproaches against her were breathed from the cold marble.\r\nNow her imagination pictured it within the aisles of a magnificent\r\ncathedral; and now again the real scene--the rustic church of Longfield\r\nwas vividly present to her mind. She saw the pathway through the green\r\nchurchyard--the ruined ivy-mantled tower, which showed how much larger\r\nthe edifice had been in former days, near which might be still discerned\r\non high a niche containing the holy mother and divine child--the\r\nhalf-defaced porch on which rude monkish imagery was carved--the\r\ntime-worn pews, and painted window. She had never entered this church\r\nbut once, many, many years ago; and it was strange how in sleep and\r\nfever-troubled reverie, each portion of it presented itself distinctly\r\nand vividly to her imagination. During these perturbed visions, one\r\nother form and voice perpetually recurred. She heard Ethel continually\r\nrepeat, \"Come! come!\" and often her figure flitted round the tomb or sat\r\nbeside it. Once, on awakening from a dream, which impressed her deeply\r\nby the importunity and earnestness of her daughter's appeal, she was\r\nforcibly impelled to consider it her duty to obey, and she made a vow\r\nthat on recovering from her illness, she would visit her husband's\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nNow while pondering on the humiliations and cheerless necessities which\r\ndarkened her future, and rousing herself to form some kind of resolution\r\nconcerning them, this dream was repeated, and on awakening, the memory\r\nof her forgotten vow renewed itself in her. She dwelt on it with\r\npleasure. Here was something to be done that was not mere wretchedness\r\nand lonely wandering--something that, connecting her with the past, took\r\naway the sense of desertion and solitude, so hard to bear. In the\r\nmorning, at breakfast, it so chanced that she read in the Morning Herald\r\na little paragraph announcing that Viscount Maristow was entertaining a\r\nparty of friends at Maristow Castle, among whom were Mr. and Mrs.\r\nVilliers, and the Hon. Mrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry. This was a fortunate\r\ncoincidence. The dragon ceased for a moment to watch the garden, and she\r\nmight avail herself of its absence to visit its treasure unnoticed and\r\nunknown. She put her project into immediate execution. She crossed the\r\ncountry, passing through London on her way to Longfield--she arrived.\r\nWithout delay she fulfilled her purpose. She entered the church and\r\nviewed the tablet, inscribed simply with the name of Lodore, and the date\r\nof his birth and death. The words were few and common-place, but they were\r\neloquent to her. They told her that the cold decaying shape lay beneath,\r\nwhich in the pride of life and love had clasped her in its arms as its\r\nown for evermore. Short-lived had been the possession. She had loosened\r\nthe tie even while thought and feeling ruled the now insentient\r\nbrain--he had been scarcely less dead to her while inhabiting the\r\ndistant Illinois, than now that a stone placed above him, gave visible\r\ntoken of his material presence, and the eternal absence of his immortal\r\npart. Cornelia had never before felt so sensibly that she had been a\r\nwife neglecting her duties, despising a vow she had solemnly pledged,\r\nestranging herself from him, who by religious ordinance, and the laws of\r\nsociety, alone had privilege to protect and love her. Nor had she before\r\nfelt so intimately the change--that she was a widow; that her lover, her\r\nhusband, the father of her child, the forsaken, dead Lodore, was indeed\r\nno part of the tissue of life, action, and feeling to which she\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\nSolitude and sickness had before awakened many thoughts in her mind, and\r\nshe recalled them as she sat beside her dead husband's grave. She looked\r\ninto her motives, tried to understand the deceits she had practised on\r\nherself, and to purify her conscience. She meditated on time, that law\r\nof the world, which is so mysterious, and so potent; ruling us\r\ndespotically, and yet wholly unappreciated till we think upon it.\r\nPetrarch says, that he was never so young, but that he knew that he was\r\ngrowing old. Lady Lodore had never thought of this till a few months back;\r\nit seemed to her, that she had never known it until now--that she felt that\r\nshe was older--older than the vain and lovely bride of Lodore--than the\r\nhaughty high-spirited friend of Casimir Lyzinski. And where was Casimir?\r\nShe had never heard of him again, she had scarcely ever thought of him;\r\nhe had grown older too--change, the effects of passion or of destiny,\r\nmust have visited him also;--they were all embarked on one mighty\r\nstream--Lodore had gained a haven; but the living were still at the\r\nmercy of the vast torrent--whither would it hurry them?\r\n\r\nThere was a charm in these melancholy and speculative thoughts to the\r\nbeautiful exile--for we may be indeed as easily exiled by a few roods of\r\nground, as by mountains and seas. A strong decree of fate banished\r\nCornelia from the familiar past, into an unknown and strange present.\r\nStill she clung to the recollection of bygone years, and for the first\r\ntime gave way to reflections full of scenes and persons to be seen no\r\nmore. The tomb beside which she lingered, was an outward sign of these\r\npast events, and she did not like to lose sight of it so soon. She heard\r\nthat Mrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry was to remain away for a month--so much\r\ntime at least was hers. She inquired for lodgings, and was directed to\r\nDame Nixon's cottage. She was somewhat dismayed at first by its\r\npenurious appearance, but \"it would do for a few days;\" and she found\r\nthat what would serve for a few days, might serve for months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Man wants but little here below,\r\nNor wants that little long.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMost true for\r\nsolitary man. It is society that increases his desires. If Lady Lodore had\r\nbeen visited in her humble dwelling by the least regarded among her\r\nacquaintances, she would have felt keenly its glaring deficiencies. But\r\nalthough used to luxury, Margaret's cuisine sufficed for herself alone;\r\nthe low-roofed rooms were high enough, and the latticed windows which\r\nlet in the light of heaven, fulfilled their purpose as well as the\r\nplate-glass and lofty embrasures of a palace.\r\n\r\nLady Lodore was obliged also to consider one other thing, which forms so\r\nlarge a portion of our meditations in real life--her purse. She found when\r\nsettled in the cottage, in the Vale of Bewling, that her stock of money\r\nwas reduced to one hundred pounds. She could not cross the country and\r\nestablish herself at a distance from London with this sum only. She had\r\nbefore looked forward to selling her jewels and carriage as to a distant\r\nevent, but now she felt that it was the _next_ thing she must do. She\r\nshrunk from it naturally: the very idea of revisiting London--of seeing\r\nits busy shops and streets--once so full of life and its purposes to\r\nher, and in which she would now wander an alien, was inconceivably\r\nsaddening; she was willing to put off the necessity as long as possible,\r\nand thus continued to procrastinate her departure from Essex.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fitzhenry returned; but she could neither know nor dream of the\r\nvicinity of her sister-in-law. We are apt to think, when we know nothing\r\nof any one, that no one knows any thing of us; experience can scarcely\r\nteach us, that the reverse of this is often the truth. Seeing only an\r\nold woman in her dotage--and a poor love-sick girl, who knew nothing\r\nbeyond the one event which had blasted all her happiness--she never\r\nheard the inhabitants of Longfield mentioned, and believed that she was\r\nequally unheard of by them. Then her indisposition protracted her stay,\r\nand now the mortal illness of the poor woman. For she had become\r\ninterested for Margaret and promised to befriend her; and in case of her\r\ngrandmother's death, to take her from a spot where every association and\r\nappearance kept open the wounds inflicted by her unfaithful lover.\r\n\r\nTime had thus passed on: now sad, now cheerful, she tried to banish\r\nevery thought of the future, and to make the occurrences of each day\r\nfill and satisfy her mind. She lived obscurely and humbly, and perhaps\r\nas wisely as mortal may in this mysterious world, where hope is\r\nperpetually followed by disappointment, and action by repentance and\r\nregret. The days succeeded to each other in one unvaried tenor. The\r\nweather was cheerful, the breath of spring animating. She watched the\r\nswelling of the buds--the peeping heads of the crocuses--the opening of\r\nthe anemones and wild wind-flowers, and at last, the sweet odour of the\r\nnew-born violets, with all the interest created by novelty; not that she\r\nhad not observed and watched these things before, with transitory\r\npleasure, but now the operations of nature filled all her world; the\r\nearth was no longer merely the dwelling place of her acquaintance, the\r\nstage on which the business of society was carried on, but the mother of\r\nlife--the temple of God--the beautiful and varied store-house of\r\nbounteous nature.\r\n\r\nDwelling on these ideas, Cornelia often thought of Horatio Saville,\r\nwhose conversations, now remembered, were the source whence she drew the\r\nknowledge and poetry of her present reveries. As solitude and nature\r\ngrew lovely in her eyes, she yearned yet more fondly for the one who\r\ncould embellish all she saw. Yet while her mind needed a companion so\r\ncongenial to her present feelings, her heart was fuller of Ethel; her\r\naffection for Saville was a calm though deep-rooted sentiment, resulting\r\nfrom the conviction, that she should find entire happiness if united to\r\nhim, and in an esteem or rather an enthusiastic admiration of his\r\ntalents and virtues, that led her to dwell with complacency on the hope,\r\nthat he still remembered and loved her: but the human heart is jealous,\r\nand with difficulty admits two emotions of equal force, and her love for\r\nher daughter was the master passion. The instinct of nature spoke\r\naudibly within her; the atoms of her frame seemed alive each one as she\r\nthought of her; often her tears flowed, often her eyes brightened with\r\ngladness when alone, and the beloved image of her beautiful daughter as\r\nshe saw her last, smiling amidst penury and indignity, was her dearest\r\ncompanion by day and night. She alone made her present situation\r\nendurable, and yet separation from her was irksome beyond expression.\r\nWas she never to see or hear of her more? It was very hard: she implored\r\nProvidence to change the harsh decree--she longed inexpressibly for one\r\nword that had reference to her--one event, however slight, which should\r\nmake her existence palpable.\r\n\r\nWhen Margaret announced Mrs. Fitzhenry, her heart bounded with joy. She\r\ncould ask concerning Ethel--hear; her countenance was radiant with\r\ndelight, and she really for a moment thought her sister-in-law's visit\r\nwas meant in kindness, since so much pleasure was the result. This\r\nconviction had produced the very thing it anticipated. She had given\r\npoor Bessy no time to announce the actual intention with which she came;\r\nshe had borne away her sullen mood by force of sweet smiles and sweeter\r\nwords; and saw her depart with gladdened spirits, whispering to herself\r\nthe fresh hopes and fond emotions which filled her bosom. She walked\r\nback to her little garden and stooped to gather some fresh violets, and\r\nto prop a drooping jonquil heavy with its burthen of sweet blooms. She\r\ninhaled the vernal odours with rapture. \"Yes,\" she thought, \"nature is\r\nthe refuge and home for women: they have no public career--no aim nor\r\nend beyond their domestic circle; but they can extend that, and make all\r\nthe creations of nature their own, to foster and do good to. We\r\ncomplain, when shut up in cities of the niggard rules of society, which\r\ngives us only the drawing-room or ball-room in which to display our\r\ntalents, and which, for ever turning the sympathy of those around us\r\ninto envy on the part of women, or what is called love on that of men,\r\nbesets our path with dangers or sorrows. But throw aside all vanity, no\r\nlonger seek to surpass your own sex, nor to inspire the other with\r\nfeelings which are pregnant with disquiet or misery, and which seldom\r\nend in mutual benevolence, turn your steps to the habitation which God\r\nhas given as befitting his creatures, contemplate the lovely ornaments\r\nwith which he has blessed the earth;--here is no heart-burning nor\r\ncalumny; it is better to love, to be of use to one of these flowers,\r\nthan to be the admired of the many--the mere puppet of one's own\r\nvanity.\"\r\n\r\nLady Lodore entered the house; she asked concerning her poor hostess, and\r\nlearnt that she slept. For a short time she employed herself with her\r\nembroidery; her thoughts were all awake; and as her fingers created\r\nlikenesses of the flowers she loved, several times her eyes filled with\r\ntears as she thought of Ethel, and how happy she could be if her fate\r\npermitted her to cultivate her affection and enjoy her society.\r\n\r\n\"It is very sad,\" she thought; \"only a few minutes ago my spirits were\r\nbuoyant, gladdened as they were by Bessy's visit; but they flag again,\r\nwhen I think of my loneliness and the unreplying silence of this place.\r\nWhat is to become of me? I shall remain here: yes; I shall not banish\r\nmyself to some inhospitable nook, where I should never hear her name.\r\nBut am I not to see her again? Am I to be nothing to her? Is she\r\nsatisfied with my absence--and are they all--to whom I am bound by ties\r\nof consanguinity or affection, indifferent to the knowledge of whether I\r\nexist or not? Nothing gives token to them of my life; it is as if the\r\ngrave had closed abruptly over me--and had it closed, thus I should have\r\nbeen mourned, in coldness and neglect.\"\r\n\r\nAgain her eyes were suffused; but as she wiped away the blinding tears,\r\nshe was recalled from her reflections by the bright rays of the sun\r\nwhich entered her little room. She threw open the door, stepped out into\r\nthe garden--the sun was setting; the atmosphere was calm, and lighted up\r\nby golden beams; the few clouds were dyed in the same splendid hues, the\r\nbirds sent forth a joyous song at intervals, and a band of rooks passed\r\nabove the little wood, cawing loudly. The air was balmy, the\r\nindescribable freshness of spring was abroad, interpenetrating and\r\ncheerful. Cornelia's melancholy fled as she felt and gave way to its\r\ninfluence. \"God blesses all things,\" she thought, \"and he will also\r\nbless me. Much wrong have I done, but love pure and disinterested is in\r\nmy heart, and I shall be repaid. My own sweet Ethel! I have sacrificed\r\nevery thing except my life for your sake, and I would add my life to the\r\ngift, could it avail you. I ask but for you and your love. The world has\r\nmany blessings, and I have asked for them before, with tears and\r\nanguish, but I give up all now, except you, my child. You are all the\r\nworld to me! Will you not come, even now, as I implore Heaven to give\r\nyou to me?\"\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes in prayer, and it seemed as if her wishes were to be\r\naccomplished--surely once in a life God will grant the earnest entreaty\r\nof a loving heart. Cornelia believed that he would, that happiness was\r\nnear at hand, and life not all a blank. She heard a rustling among the\r\ntrees, a light step;--was it Margaret? She had scarcely asked herself\r\nthis question, when the dear object of her every thought and hope was\r\nbefore her--in her arms;--Ethel had entered from the wood, had seen her\r\nmother, had sprung forward and clasped her to her heart.\r\n\r\n\"My dear, dear child!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dearest mother!\" repeated Ethel, as her eyes were filled with tears of\r\ndelight, \"why did you go--why conceal yourself? You do not know the\r\nanxiety we have suffered, and how very unhappy your absence has made us.\r\nBut I have found you--of all that have gone to seek you, I have found\r\nyou; I deserve this reward, for I love you most of all.\"\r\n\r\nLady Lodore returned her daughter's caresses--and her tears flowed fast for\r\nvery joy, and then she turned to Mrs. Fitzhenry, who followed Ethel, but\r\nwho had been outspeeded by her in her eagerness. The old lady's face was\r\nbeaming with happiness. \"Ah, Bessy, you have betrayed me--traitress! I\r\ndid not expect this--I do not deserve such excessive happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"You deserve all, and much more than we can any of us bestow,\" cried\r\nEthel, \"except that your dear generous heart will repay you beyond any\r\nreward we can give, and you will be blest in the happiness we owe to you\r\nalone. Edward is gone far away into Wales in quest of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"An Angelica run after by the Paladins,\" said Lady Lodore, smiling through\r\nher tears.\r\n\r\n\"Paladins, worthy the name!\" replied Ethel. \"Horatio is even now on the\r\nsalt seas for your sake--he is returning discomfited and hopeless from\r\nhis journey of discovery to the Pyrenees--his zeal almost deserved the\r\nreward which I have found, yet who but she, for whom you sacrificed so\r\nmuch, ought to be the first to thank you? And while we all try to show\r\nyou an inexpressible gratitude, ought not I to be the first to see,\r\nfirst to kiss, first--always the first--to love you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nNone, I trust,\r\nRepines at these delights, they are free and harmless:\r\nAfter distress at sea, the dangers o'er,\r\nSafety and welcomes better taste ashore.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus the tale of \"Lodore\" is ended. The person who bore that title by right\r\nof descent, has long slept in peace in the church of his native village.\r\nNeither his own passions, nor those of others, can renew the pulsations\r\nof his heart. \"The silver cord is loosed, and the pitcher broken at the\r\nfountain.\" His life had not been fruitless. The sedulous care and\r\nadmirable education he had bestowed on Ethel, would, had he lived, have\r\ncompensated to him for his many sufferings, and been a source of pure\r\nand unfading joy to the end. He was not destined in this world to reap\r\nthe harvest of his virtues, though his errors had been punished\r\nseverely. Still his memory is the presiding genius of his daughter's\r\nlife, and the name of Lodore contains for her a spell that dignifies\r\nexistence in her own eyes, and incites her to render all her thoughts\r\nand actions such as her beloved father would have approved. It was fated\r\nthat the evil which he did should die with him--but the good out-lived\r\nhim long, and was a blessing to those whom he loved far better than\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nShe who received the title on her marriage, henceforth continued her\r\nexistence under another; and the wife of Saville, who soon after became\r\nViscountess Maristow, loses her right to be chronicled in these pages.\r\nSo few years indeed are passed since the period to which the last\r\nchapter brought us, that it may be safely announced that Cornelia\r\nSanterre possesses that happiness, through her generosity and devoted\r\naffection, which she had lost through pride and self-exaltation. She\r\nwonders at her past self--and laments the many opportunities she lost\r\nfor benefiting others, and proving herself worthy of their attachment.\r\nHer pride is gone, or rather, her pride is now placed in redeeming her\r\nfaults. She is humble, knowing how much she was deceived in herself--she\r\nis forgiving, for she feels that she needs forgiveness. She looks on the\r\ntrack of years she has passed over as wasted, and she wishes to retrieve\r\ntheir loss. She respects, admires, in some sense it may be said, that\r\nshe adores her husband; but even while consenting to be his, and thus\r\nsecuring her own happiness, she told him that her first duties were\r\ntowards Ethel--and that he took a divided heart, over the better part of\r\nwhich reigned maternal love. Saville, the least egoistic of human\r\nbeings, smiled to hear her name that a defect, which was in his eyes her\r\ncrowning virtue.\r\n\r\nEdward Villiers learnt to prize worldly prosperity at its true value,\r\nand each day blesses the train of circumstances that led him to wed\r\nEthel, even though poverty and suffering had followed close behind.\r\nEthel herself might be said to have been always happy. She was incapable\r\nof being impressed by any sorrow, that did not touch her for another's\r\nsake: and while she exerted herself to alleviate the pain endured by\r\nthose she loved, she passed on unhurt. Heaven spared her life's most\r\ncruel evils. Death had done its worst when she lost her father. Now,\r\nsurrounded by dear friends, and the object of her husband's constant\r\ntenderness, she pursues a tranquil course: which for any one to consider\r\nthe most blissful allotted to mortals, they must have a heart like her\r\nown--faithful, affectionate, and generous.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Fitzhenry, kind and gentle aunt Bessy, always felt her\r\nheaven clouded while she indulged in her aversion to her sister-in-law.\r\nShe is happy now that she is reconciled to Cornelia; strange to say, she\r\nloves her even more than she loves Ethel--she is more intimately\r\nconnected in her mind with the memory of Lodore. She often visits her at\r\nMaristow Castle; in the neighbourhood of which Margaret is settled,\r\nbeing happily married. Colonel Villiers still lives in Paris. He is in a\r\nmiserable state of poverty, difficulty, and ill-health. His wife has\r\ndeserted him: he neglected and outraged her, and she in a fit of remorse\r\nleft him, and returned to nurse her father during a lingering illness,\r\nwhich is likely to continue to the end of his life, though he shows no\r\nsymptoms of immediate decay. He is eager to lavish all his wealth on his\r\nchild, if he can be sure that no portion of it is shared by her husband.\r\nWith infinite difficulty, and at the cost of many privations, she, with\r\na true woman's feeling, contrives to send him remittances now and then,\r\nthough she receives in return neither thanks nor kindness. He pursues a\r\ncourse of dissipation in its most degraded form--a wretched hanger-on at\r\nresorts, misnamed of pleasure--gambling while he has any money to\r\nlose--trying to ruin others as he has been ruined.\r\n\r\nThus we have done our duty, in bringing under view, in a brief summary,\r\nthe little that there is to tell of the personages who formed the drama\r\nof this tale. One only remains to be mentioned: but it is not in a few\r\ntame lines that we can revert to the varied fate of Fanny Derham. She\r\ncontinued for some time among her beloved friends, innocent and calm as\r\nshe was beautiful and wise; circumstances at last led her away from\r\nthem, and she has entered upon life. One who feels so deeply for others,\r\nand yet is so stern a censor over herself--at once so sensitive and so\r\nrigidly conscientious--so single-minded and upright, and yet open as day\r\nto charity and affection, cannot hope to pass from youth to age\r\nunharmed. Deceit, and selfishness, and the whole web of human passion\r\nmust envelope her, and occasion her many sorrows; and the unworthiness\r\nof her fellow-creatures inflict infinite pain on her noble heart: still\r\nshe cannot be contaminated--she will turn neither to the right nor left,\r\nbut pursue her way unflinching; and, in her lofty idea of the dignity of\r\nher nature, in her love of truth and in her integrity, she will find\r\nsupport and reward in her various fortunes. What the events are, that\r\nhave already diversified her existence, cannot now be recounted; and it\r\nwould require the gift of prophecy to foretell the conclusion. In after\r\ntimes these may be told, and the life of Fanny Derham be presented as a\r\nuseful lesson, at once to teach what goodness and genius can achieve in\r\npalliating the woes of life, and to encourage those, who would in any\r\nway imitate her, by an example of calumny refuted by patience, errors\r\nrectified by charity, and the passions of our nature purified and\r\nennobled by an underviating observance of those moral laws on which all\r\nhuman excellence is founded--a love of truth in ourselves, and a sincere\r\nsympathy with our fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LODORE, VOL. 3 (OF 3) ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It may be unreservedly admitted\r\nthat her association with Shelley, and her care of his writings and\r\nmemory after his death, are the strongest of her titles to remembrance.\r\nIt is further undeniable that the most original of her works is also\r\nthat which betrays the strongest traces of his influence. _Frankenstein_\r\nwas written when her brain, magnetized by his companionship, was capable\r\nof an effort never to be repeated. But if the frame of mind which\r\nengendered and sustained the work was created by Shelley, the conception\r\nwas not his, and the diction is dissimilar to his. Both derive from\r\nGodwin, but neither is Godwin\u2019s. The same observation, except for an\r\noccasional phrase caught from Shelley, applies to all her subsequent\r\nwork. The frequent exaltation of spirit, the ideality and romance, may\r\nwell have been Shelley\u2019s\u2014the general style of execution neither repeats\r\nnor resembles him.\r\n\r\nMary Shelley\u2019s voice, then, is not to die away as a mere echo of her\r\nillustrious husband\u2019s. She has the _prima facie_ claim to a hearing due\r\nto every writer who can assert the possession of a distinctive\r\nindividuality; and if originality be once conceded to _Frankenstein_, as\r\nin all equity it must, none will dispute the validity of a title to fame\r\ngrounded on such a work. It has solved the question itself\u2014it is famous.\r\nIt is full of faults venial in an author of nineteen; but, apart from\r\nthe wild grandeur of the conception, it has that which even the maturity\r\nof mere talent never attains\u2014the insight of genius which looks below the\r\nappearances of things, and perhaps even reverses its own first\r\nconception by the discovery of some underlying truth. Mary Shelley\u2019s\r\noriginal intention was probably that which would alone have occurred to\r\nmost writers in her place. She meant to paint Frankenstein\u2019s monstrous\r\ncreation as an object of unmitigated horror. The perception that he was\r\nan object of intense compassion as well imparted a moral value to what\r\notherwise would have remained a daring flight of imagination. It has\r\ndone more: it has helped to create, if it did not itself beget, a type\r\nof personage unknown to ancient fiction. The conception of a character\r\nat once justly execrable and truly pitiable is altogether modern.\r\nRichard the Third and Caliban make some approach towards it; but the\r\nformer is too self-sufficing in his valour and his villainy to be deeply\r\npitied, and the latter too senseless and brutal. Victor Hugo has made\r\nhimself the laureate of pathetic deformity, but much of his work is a\r\nconscious or unconscious variation on the original theme of\r\n_Frankenstein_.\r\n\r\nNone of Mary Shelley\u2019s subsequent romances approached _Frankenstein_ in\r\npower and popularity. The reason may be summed up in a word\u2014Languor.\r\nAfter the death of her infant son in 1819, she could never again command\r\nthe energy which had carried her so vigorously through _Frankenstein_.\r\nExcept in one instance, her work did not really interest her. Her heart\r\nis not in it. _Valperga_ contains many passages of exquisite beauty; but\r\nit was, as the authoress herself says, \u201ca child of mighty slow growth;\u201d\r\n\u201claboriously dug,\u201d Shelley adds, \u201cout of a hundred old chronicles,\u201d and\r\nwants the fire of imagination which alone could have interpenetrated the\r\nmass and fused its diverse ingredients into a satisfying whole. Of the\r\nlater novels, _The Last Man_ excepted, it is needless to speak, save for\r\nthe autobiographic interest with which Professor Dowden\u2019s fortunate\r\ndiscovery has informed the hitherto slighted pages of _Lodore_. But _The\r\nLast Man_ demands great attention, for it is not only a work of far\r\nhigher merit than commonly admitted, but of all her works the most\r\ncharacteristic of the authoress, the most representative of Mary Shelley\r\nin the character of pining widowhood which it was her destiny to support\r\nfor the remainder of her life. It is an idealized version of her sorrows\r\nand sufferings, made to contribute a note to the strain which celebrates\r\nthe final dissolution of the world. The languor which mars her other\r\nwritings is a beauty here, harmonizing with the general tone of sublime\r\nmelancholy. Most pictures of the end of the world, painted or penned,\r\nhave an apocalyptic character. Men\u2019s imaginations are powerfully\r\nimpressed by great convulsions of nature; fire, tempest, and earthquake\r\nare summoned to effect the dissolution of the expiring earth. In _The\r\nLast Man_ pestilence is the sole agent, and the tragedy is purely human.\r\nThe tale consequently lacks the magnificence which the subject might\r\nhave seemed to invite, but, on the other hand, gains in pathos\u2014a pathos\r\ngreatly increased when the authoress\u2019s identity is recollected, and it\r\nis observed how vividly actual experience traverses her web of fiction.\r\nNone can have been affected by Mary Shelley\u2019s work so deeply as Mary\r\nShelley herself; for the scenery is that of her familiar haunts, the\r\npersonages are her intimates under thin disguises, the universal\r\ncatastrophe is but the magnified image of the overthrow of her own\r\nfortunes; and there are pages on pages where every word must have come\r\nto her fraught with some unutterably sweet or bitter association. Yet,\r\nthough her romance could never be to the public what it was to the\r\nauthor, it is surprising that criticism should have hitherto done so\r\nlittle justice either to its pervading nobility of thought or to the\r\neloquence and beauty of very many inspired passages.\r\n\r\nWhen _The Last Man_ is reprinted it will come before the world as a new\r\nwork. The same is the case with the short tales in this collection, the\r\nvery existence of which is probably unknown to those most deeply\r\ninterested in Mary Shelley. The entire class of literature to which they\r\nbelong has long ago gone into Time\u2019s wallet as \u201calms for oblivion.\u201d They\r\nare exclusively contributions to a form of publication utterly\r\nsuperseded in this hasty age\u2014the Annual, whose very name seemed to\r\nprophesy that it would not be perennial. For the creations of the\r\nintellect, however, there is a way back from Avernus. Every new\r\ngeneration convicts the last of undue precipitation in discarding the\r\nwork of its own immediate predecessor. The special literary form may be\r\nincapable of revival; but the substance of that which has pleased or\r\nprofited its age, be it Crashaw\u2019s verse, or Etherege\u2019s comedies, or\r\nHoadly\u2019s pamphlets, or what it may, always repays a fresh examination,\r\nand is always found to contribute some element useful or acceptable to\r\nthe literature of a later day. The day of the \u201csplendid annual\u201d was\r\ncertainly not a vigorous or healthy one in the history of English\r\n_belles-lettres_. It came in at the ebb of the great tide of poetry\r\nwhich followed on the French Revolution, and before the insetting of the\r\ngreat tide of Victorian prose. A pretentious feebleness characterizes\r\nthe majority of its productions, half of which are hardly above the\r\nlevel of the album. Yet it had its good points, worthy to be taken into\r\naccount. The necessary brevity of contributions to an annual operated as\r\na powerful check on the loquacity so unfortunately encouraged by the\r\nthree-volume novel. There was no room for tiresome descriptions of\r\nminuti\u00e6, or interminable talk about uninteresting people. Being,\r\nmoreover, largely intended for the perusal of high-born maidens in\r\npalace towers, the annuals frequently affected an exalted order of\r\nsentiment, which, if intolerable in insincere or merely mechanical\r\nhands, encouraged the emotion of a really passionate writer as much as\r\nthe present taste for minute delineation represses it. This perfectly\r\nsuited Mary Shelley. No writer felt less call to reproduce the society\r\naround her. It did not interest her in the smallest degree. The bent of\r\nher soul was entirely towards the ideal. This ideal was by no means\r\nburied in the grave of Shelley. She aspired passionately towards an\r\nimaginary perfection all her life, and solaced disappointment with what,\r\nin actual existence, too often proved the parent of fresh disillusion.\r\nIn fiction it was otherwise; the fashionable style of publication, with\r\nall its faults, encouraged the enthusiasm, rapturous or melancholy, with\r\nwhich she adored the present or lamented the lost. She could fully\r\nindulge her taste for exalted sentiment in the Annual, and the necessary\r\nlimitations of space afforded less scope for that creeping languor which\r\nrelaxed the nerve of her more ambitious productions. In these little\r\ntales she is her perfect self, and the reader will find not only the\r\nentertainment of interesting fiction, but a fair picture of the mind,\r\nrepressed in its energies by circumstances, but naturally enthusiastic\r\nand aspiring, of a lonely, thwarted, misunderstood woman, who could\r\nseldom do herself justice, and whose precise place in the contemporary\r\nconstellation of genius remains to be determined.\r\n\r\nThe merit of a collection of stories, casually written at different\r\nperiods and under different influences, must necessarily be various. As\r\na rule, it may be said that Mary Shelley is best when most ideal, and\r\nexcels in proportion to the exaltation of the sentiment embodied in her\r\ntale. Virtue, patriotism, disinterested affection, are very real things\r\nto her; and her heroes and heroines, if generally above the ordinary\r\nplane of humanity, never transgress the limits of humanity itself. Her\r\nfault is the other way, and arises from a positive incapacity for\r\npainting the ugly and the commonplace. She does her best, but her\r\nvillains do not impress us. Minute delineation of character is never\r\nattempted; it lay entirely out of her sphere. Her tales are consequently\r\nexecuted in the free, broad style of the eighteenth century, towards\r\nwhich a reaction is now fortunately observable. As stories, they are\r\nvery good. The theme is always interesting, and the sequence of events\r\nnatural. No person and no incident, perhaps, takes a very strong hold\r\nupon the imagination; but the general impression is one of a sphere of\r\nexalted feeling into which it is good to enter, and which ennobles as\r\nmuch as the photography of ugliness degrades. The diction, as usual in\r\nthe imaginative literature of the period, is frequently too ornate, and\r\ncould spare a good many adjectives. But its native strength is revealed\r\nin passages of impassioned feeling; and remarkable command over the\r\nresources of the language is displayed in descriptions of scenes of\r\nnatural beauty. The microscopic touch of a Browning or a Meredith,\r\nbringing the scene vividly before the mind\u2019s eye, is indeed absolutely\r\nwanting; but the landscape is suffused with the poetical atmosphere of a\r\nClaude or a Danby. The description at the beginning of _The Sisters of\r\nAlbano_ is a characteristic and beautiful instance.\r\n\r\nThe biographical element is deeply interwoven with these as with all\r\nMary Shelley\u2019s writings. It is of especial interest to search out the\r\ntraces of her own history, and the sources from which her descriptions\r\nand ideas may have been derived. _The Mourner_ has evident vestiges of\r\nher residence near Windsor when _Alastor_ was written, and probably\r\nreflects the general impression derived from Shelley\u2019s recollections of\r\nEton. The visit to P\u00e6stum in _The Pole_ recalls one of the most\r\nbeautiful of Shelley\u2019s letters, which Mary, however, probably never saw.\r\nClaire Clairmont\u2019s fortunes seem glanced at in one or two places; and\r\nthe story of _The Pole_ may be partly founded on some experience of hers\r\nin Russia. Trelawny probably suggested the subjects of the two Greek\r\ntales, _The Evil Eye_, and _Euphrasia. The Mortal Immortal_ is a\r\nvariation on the theme of _St. Leon_, and _Transformation_ on that of\r\n_Frankenstein_. These are the only tales in the collection which betray\r\nthe influence of Godwin, and neither is so fully worked out as it might\r\nhave been. Mary Shelley was evidently more at home with a human than\r\nwith a superhuman ideal; her enthusiasm soars high, but does not\r\ntranscend the possibilities of human nature. The artistic merit of her\r\ntales will be diversely estimated, but no reader will refuse the\r\nauthoress facility of invention, or command of language, or elevation of\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n                                -------\r\n\r\n\r\n                   I.

The spring had nearly grown into summer, the trees were\r\nall in full but fresh green foliage, the vine-dresser was singing,\r\nperched among them, training his vines: the cicada had not yet begun her\r\nsong, the heats therefore had not commenced; but at evening the\r\nfire-flies gleamed among the hills, and the cooing aziola assured us of\r\nwhat in that country needs no assurance\u2014fine weather for the morrow. We\r\nset out early in the morning to avoid the heats, breakfasted at Albano,\r\nand till ten o\u2019clock passed our time in visiting the Mosaic, the villa\r\nof Cicero, and other curiosities of the place. We reposed during the\r\nmiddle of the day in a tent elevated for us at the hill-top, whence we\r\nlooked on the hill-embosomed lake, and the distant eminence crowned by a\r\ntown with its church. Other villages and cottages were scattered among\r\nthe foldings of mountains, and beyond we saw the deep blue sea of the\r\nsouthern poets, which received the swift and immortal Tiber, rocking it\r\nto repose among its devouring waves. The Coliseum falls and the Pantheon\r\ndecays,\u2014the very hills of Rome are perishing,\u2014but the Tiber lives for\r\never, flows for ever, and for ever feeds the land-encircled\r\nMediterranean with fresh waters.\r\n\r\nOur summer and pleasure-seeking party consisted of many: to me the most\r\ninteresting person was the Countess Atanasia D\u2014\u2014, who was as beautiful\r\nas an imagination of Raphael, and good as the ideal of a poet. Two of\r\nher children accompanied her, with animated looks and gentle manners,\r\nquiet, yet enjoying. I sat near her, watching the changing shadows of\r\nthe landscape before us. As the sun descended, it poured a tide of light\r\ninto the valley of the lake, deluging the deep bank formed by the\r\nmountain with liquid gold. The domes and turrets of the far town flashed\r\nand gleamed, the trees were dyed in splendour; two or three slight\r\nclouds, which had drunk the radiance till it became their essence,\r\nfloated golden islets in the lustrous empyrean. The waters, reflecting\r\nthe brilliancy of the sky and the fire-tinted banks, beamed a second\r\nheaven, a second irradiated earth, at our feet. The Mediterranean,\r\ngazing on the sun,\u2014as the eyes of a mortal bride fail and are dimmed\r\nwhen reflecting her lover\u2019s glance,\u2014was lost, mixed in his light, till\r\nit had become one with him.\u2014Long (our souls, like the sea, the hills,\r\nand lake, drinking in the supreme loveliness) we gazed, till the too\r\nfull cup overflowed, and we turned away with a sigh.\r\n\r\nAt our feet there was a knoll of ground, that formed the foreground of\r\nour picture; two trees lay basking against the sky, glittering with the\r\ngolden light, which like dew seemed to hang amid their branches; a rock\r\nclosed the prospect on the other side, twined round by creepers, and\r\nredolent with blooming myrtle; a brook, crossed by huge stones, gushed\r\nthrough the turf, and on the fragments of rock that lay about, sat two\r\nor three persons, peasants, who attracted our attention. One was a\r\nhunter, as his gun, lying on a bank not far off, demonstrated, yet he\r\nwas a tiller of the soil; his rough straw hat, and his picturesque but\r\ncoarse dress, belonged to that class. The other was some contadina, in\r\nthe costume of her country, returning, her basket on her arm, from the\r\nvillage to her cottage home. They were regarding the stores of a pedlar,\r\nwho with doffed hat stood near: some of these consisted of pictures and\r\nprints\u2014views of the country, and portraits of the Madonna. Our peasants\r\nregarded these with pleased attention.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne might easily make out a story for that pair,\u201d I said: \u201chis gun is a\r\nhelp to the imagination, and we may fancy him a bandit with his\r\ncontadina love, the terror of all the neighbourhood, except of her, the\r\nmost defenceless being in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou speak lightly of such a combination,\u201d said the lovely countess at\r\nmy side, \u201cas if it must not in its nature be the cause of dreadful\r\ntragedies. The mingling of love with crime is a dread conjunction, and\r\nlawless pursuits are never followed without bringing on the criminal,\r\nand all allied to him, ineffable misery. I speak with emotion, for your\r\nobservation reminds me of an unfortunate girl, now one of the Sisters of\r\nCharity in the convent of Santa Chiara at Rome, whose unhappy passion\r\nfor a man, such as you mention, spread destruction and sorrow widely\r\naround her.\u201d\r\n\r\nI entreated my lovely friend to relate the history of the nun. For a\r\nlong time she resisted my entreaties, as not willing to depress the\r\nspirit of a party of pleasure by a tale of sorrow. But I urged her, and\r\nshe yielded. Her sweet Italian phraseology now rings in my ears, and her\r\nbeautiful countenance is before me. As she spoke, the sun set, and the\r\nmoon bent her silver horn in the ebbing tide of glory he had left. The\r\nlake changed from purple to silver, and the trees, before so splendid,\r\nnow in dark masses, just reflected from their tops the mild moonlight.\r\nThe fire-flies flashed among the rocks; the bats circled round us:\r\nmeanwhile thus commenced the Countess Atanasia:\u2014\r\n\r\nThe nun of whom I speak had a sister older than herself; I can remember\r\nthem when as children they brought eggs and fruit to my father\u2019s villa.\r\nMaria and Anina were constantly together. With their large straw hats to\r\nshield them from the scorching sun, they were at work in their father\u2019s\r\n_podere_ all day, and in the evening, when Maria, who was the elder by\r\nfour years, went to the fountain for water, Anina ran at her side. Their\r\ncot\u2014the folding of the hill conceals it\u2014is at the lake-side opposite;\r\nand about a quarter of a mile up the hill is the rustic fountain of\r\nwhich I speak. Maria was serious, gentle, and considerate; Anina was a\r\nlaughing, merry little creature, with the face of a cherub. When Maria\r\nwas fifteen, their mother fell ill, and was nursed at the convent of\r\nSanta Chiara at Rome. Maria attended her, never leaving her bedside day\r\nor night. The nuns thought her an angel, she deemed them saints: her\r\nmother died, and they persuaded her to make one of them; her father\r\ncould not but acquiesce in her holy intention, and she became one of the\r\nSisters of Charity, the nun-nurses of Santa Chiara. Once or twice a year\r\nshe visited her home, gave sage and kind advice to Anina, and sometimes\r\nwept to part from her; but her piety and her active employments for the\r\nsick reconciled her to her fate. Anina was more sorry to lose her\r\nsister\u2019s society. The other girls of the village did not please her: she\r\nwas a good child, and worked hard for her father, and her sweetest\r\nrecompense was the report he made of her to Maria, and the fond praises\r\nand caresses the latter bestowed on her when they met.\r\n\r\nIt was not until she was fifteen that Anina showed any diminution of\r\naffection for her sister. Yet I cannot call it diminution, for she loved\r\nher perhaps more than ever, though her holy calling and sage lectures\r\nprevented her from reposing confidence, and made her tremble lest the\r\nnun, devoted to heaven and good works, should read in her eyes, and\r\ndisapprove of the earthly passion that occupied her. Perhaps a part of\r\nher reluctance arose from the reports that were current against her\r\nlover\u2019s character, and certainly from the disapprobation and even hatred\r\nof him that her father frequently expressed. Ill-fated Anina! I know not\r\nif in the north your peasants love as ours; but the passion of Anina was\r\nentwined with the roots of her being, it was herself: she could die, but\r\nnot cease to love. The dislike of her father for Domenico made their\r\nintercourse clandestine. He was always at the fountain to fill her\r\npitcher, and lift it on her head. He attended the same mass; and when\r\nher father went to Albano, Velletri, or Rome, he seemed to learn by\r\ninstinct the exact moment of his departure, and joined her in the\r\n_podere_, labouring with her and for her, till the old man was seen\r\ndescending the mountain-path on his return. He said he worked for a\r\ncontadino near Nemi. Anina sometimes wondered that he could spare so\r\nmuch time for her; but his excuses were plausible, and the result too\r\ndelightful not to blind the innocent girl to its obvious cause.\r\n\r\nPoor Domenico! the reports spread against him were too well founded: his\r\nsole excuse was that his father had been a robber before him, and he had\r\nspent his early years among these lawless men. He had better things in\r\nhis nature, and yearned for the peace of the guiltless. Yet he could\r\nhardly be called guilty, for no dread crime stained him. Nevertheless,\r\nhe was an outlaw and a bandit; and now that he loved Anina, these names\r\nwere the stings of an adder to pierce his soul. He would have fled from\r\nhis comrades to a far country, but Anina dwelt amid their very haunts.\r\nAt this period also the police established by the French Government,\r\nwhich then possessed Rome, made these bands more alive to the conduct of\r\ntheir members; and rumours of active measures to be taken against those\r\nwho occupied the hills near Albano, Nemi, and Velletri, caused them to\r\ndraw together in tighter bonds. Domenico would not, if he could, desert\r\nhis friends in the hour of danger.\r\n\r\nOn a _festa_ at this time\u2014it was towards the end of October\u2014Anina\r\nstrolled with her father among the villagers, who all over Italy make\r\nholiday by congregating and walking in one place. Their talk was\r\nentirely of the _ladri_ and the French, and many terrible stories were\r\nrelated of the extirpation of banditti in the kingdom of Naples, and the\r\nmode by which the French succeeded in their undertaking was minutely\r\ndescribed. The troops scoured the country, visiting one haunt of the\r\nrobbers after the other, and dislodging them, tracked them as in those\r\ncountries they hunt the wild beasts of the forest, till, drawing the\r\ncircle narrower, they enclosed them in one spot. They then drew a cordon\r\nround the place, which they guarded with the utmost vigilance,\r\nforbidding any to enter it with provisions, on pain of instant death.\r\nAnd as this menace was rigorously executed, in a short time the besieged\r\nbandits were starved into a surrender. The French troops were now daily\r\nexpected, for they had been seen at Velletri and Nemi; at the same time\r\nit was affirmed that several outlaws had taken up their abode at Rocca\r\nGiovane, a deserted village on the summit of one of these hills, and it\r\nwas supposed that they would make that place the scene of their final\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nThe next day, as Anina worked in the _podere_, a party of French horse\r\npassed by along the road that separated her garden from the lake.\r\nCuriosity made her look at them; and her beauty was too great not to\r\nattract. Their observations and address soon drove her away; for a woman\r\nin love consecrates herself to her lover, and deems the admiration of\r\nothers to be profanation. She spoke to her father of the impertinence of\r\nthese men; and he answered by rejoicing at their arrival, and the\r\ndestruction of the lawless bands that would ensue. When in the evening\r\nAnina went to the fountain, she looked timidly around, and hoped that\r\nDomenico would be at his accustomed post, for the arrival of the French\r\ndestroyed her feeling of security. She went rather later than usual, and\r\na cloudy evening made it seem already dark; the wind roared among the\r\ntrees, bending hither and thither even the stately cypresses; the waters\r\nof the lake were agitated into high waves, and dark masses of\r\nthundercloud lowered over the hill-tops, giving a lurid tinge to the\r\nlandscape. Anina passed quickly up the mountain-path. When she came in\r\nsight of the fountain, which was rudely hewn in the living rock, she saw\r\nDomenico leaning against a projection of the hill, his hat drawn over\r\nhis eyes, his _tabaro_ fallen from his shoulders, his arms folded in an\r\nattitude of dejection. He started when he saw her; his voice and phrases\r\nwere broken and unconnected; yet he never gazed on her with such ardent\r\nlove, nor solicited her to delay her departure with such impassioned\r\ntenderness.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow glad I am to find you here!\u201d she said; \u201cI was fearful of meeting\r\none of the French soldiers: I dread them even more than the banditti.\u201d\r\n\r\nDomenico cast a look of eager inquiry on her, and then turned away,\r\nsaying, \u201cSorry am I that I shall not be here to protect you. I am\r\nobliged to go to Rome for a week or two. You will be faithful, Anina\r\nmia; you will love me, though I never see you more?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe interview, under these circumstances, was longer than usual. He led\r\nher down the path till they nearly came in sight of her cottage; still\r\nthey lingered. A low whistle was heard among the myrtle underwood at the\r\nlake-side; he started; it was repeated; and he answered it by a similar\r\nnote. Anina, terrified, was about to ask what this meant, when, for the\r\nfirst time, he pressed her to his heart, kissed her roseate lips, and,\r\nwith a muttered \u201cCarissima addio,\u201d left her, springing down the bank;\r\nand as she gazed in wonder, she thought she saw a boat cross a line of\r\nlight made by the opening of a cloud. She stood long absorbed in\r\nreverie, wondering and remembering with thrilling pleasure the quick\r\nembrace and impassioned farewell of her lover. She delayed so long that\r\nher father came to seek her.\r\n\r\nEach evening after this, Anina visited the fountain at the Ave Maria; he\r\nwas not there: each day seemed an age; and incomprehensible fears\r\noccupied her heart. About a fortnight after, letters arrived from Maria.\r\nThey came to say that she had been ill of the malaria fever, that she\r\nwas now convalescent, but that change of air was necessary for her\r\nrecovery, and that she had obtained leave to spend a month at home at\r\nAlbano. She asked her father to come the next day to fetch her. These\r\nwere pleasant tidings for Anina; she resolved to disclose everything to\r\nher sister, and during her long visit she doubted not but that she would\r\ncontrive her happiness. Old Andrea departed the following morning, and\r\nthe whole day was spent by the sweet girl in dreams of future bliss. In\r\nthe evening Maria arrived, weak and wan, with all the marks of that\r\ndread illness about her, yet, as she assured her sister, feeling quite\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nAs they sat at their frugal supper, several villagers came in to inquire\r\nfor Maria; but all their talk was of the French soldiers and the\r\nrobbers, of whom a band of at least twenty was collected in Rocca\r\nGiovane, strictly watched by the military.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe may be grateful to the French,\u201d said Andrea, \u201cfor this good deed;\r\nthe country will be rid of these ruffians.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue, friend,\u201d said another; \u201cbut it is horrible to think what these\r\nmen suffer: they have, it appears, exhausted all the food they brought\r\nwith them to the village, and are literally starving. They have not an\r\nounce of maccaroni among them; and a poor fellow who was taken and\r\nexecuted yesterday was a mere anatomy: you could tell every bone in his\r\nskin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was a sad story the other day,\u201d said another, \u201cof an old man from\r\nNemi, whose son, they say, is among them at Rocca Giovane: he was found\r\nwithin the lines with some _baccall\u00e0_ under his _pastrano_, and shot on\r\nthe spot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is not a more desperate gang,\u201d observed the first speaker, \u201cin\r\nthe states and the _regno_ put together. They have sworn never to yield\r\nbut upon good terms. To secure these, their plan is to waylay passengers\r\nand make prisoners, whom they keep as hostages for mild treatment from\r\nthe Government. But the French are merciless; they are better pleased\r\nthat the bandits wreak their vengeance on these poor creatures than\r\nspare one of their lives.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have captured two persons already,\u201d said another; \u201cand there is\r\nold Betta Tossi half frantic, for she is sure her son is taken: he has\r\nnot been at home these ten days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should rather guess,\u201d said an old man, \u201cthat he went there with\r\ngood-will: the young scapegrace kept company with Domenico Baldi of\r\nNemi.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo worse company could he have kept in the whole country,\u201d said Andrea;\r\n\u201cDomenico is the bad son of a bad race. Is he in the village with the\r\nrest?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy own eyes assured me of that,\u201d replied the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I was up the hill with eggs and fowls to the piquette there, I saw\r\nthe branches of an ilex move; the poor fellow was weak perhaps, and\r\ncould not keep his hold; presently he dropped to the ground; every\r\nmusket was levelled at him, but he started up and was away like a hare\r\namong the rocks. Once he turned, and then I saw Domenico as plainly,\r\nthough thinner, poor lad, by much than he was,\u2014as plainly as I now\r\nsee\u2014Santa Virgine! what is the matter with Nina?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe had fainted. The company broke up, and she was left to her sister\u2019s\r\ncare. When the poor child came to herself she was fully aware of her\r\nsituation, and said nothing, except expressing a wish to retire to rest.\r\nMaria was in high spirits at the prospect of her long holiday at home;\r\nbut the illness of her sister made her refrain from talking that night,\r\nand blessing her, as she said good-night, she soon slept. Domenico\r\nstarving!\u2014Domenico trying to escape and dying through hunger, was the\r\nvision of horror that wholly possessed poor Anina. At another time, the\r\ndiscovery that her lover was a robber might have inflicted pangs as keen\r\nas those which she now felt; but this at present made a faint\r\nimpression, obscured by worse wretchedness. Maria was in a deep and\r\ntranquil sleep. Anina rose, dressed herself silently, and crept\r\ndownstairs. She stored her market-basket with what food there was in the\r\nhouse, and, unlatching the cottage-door, issued forth, resolved to reach\r\nRocca Giovane, and to administer to her lover\u2019s dreadful wants. The\r\nnight was dark, but this was favourable, for she knew every path and\r\nturn of the hills, every bush and knoll of ground between her home and\r\nthe deserted village which occupies the summit of that hill. You may see\r\nthe dark outline of some of its houses about two hours\u2019 walk from her\r\ncottage. The night was dark, but still; the _libeccio_ brought the\r\nclouds below the mountain-tops, and veiled the horizon in mist; not a\r\nleaf stirred; her footsteps sounded loud in her ears, but resolution\r\novercame fear. She had entered yon ilex grove, her spirits rose with her\r\nsuccess, when suddenly she was challenged by a sentinel; no time for\r\nescape; fear chilled her blood; her basket dropped from her arm; its\r\ncontents rolled out on the ground; the soldier fired his gun, and\r\nbrought several others round him; she was made prisoner.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, when Maria awoke she missed her sister from her side. I\r\nhave overslept myself, she thought, and Nina would not disturb me. But\r\nwhen she came downstairs and met her father, and Anina did not appear,\r\nthey began to wonder. She was not in the _podere_; two hours passed, and\r\nthen Andrea went to seek her. Entering the near village, he saw the\r\ncontadini crowding together, and a stifled exclamation of \u201cEcco il\r\npadre!\u201d told him that some evil had betided. His first impression was\r\nthat his daughter was drowned; but the truth, that she had been taken by\r\nthe French carrying provisions within the forbidden line, was still more\r\nterrible. He returned in frantic desperation to his cottage, first to\r\nacquaint Maria with what had happened, and then to ascend the hill to\r\nsave his child from her impending fate. Maria heard his tale with\r\nhorror; but an hospital is a school in which to learn self-possession\r\nand presence of mind. \u201cDo you remain, my father,\u201d she said; \u201cI will go.\r\nMy holy character will awe these men, my tears move them: trust me; I\r\nswear that I will save my sister.\u201d Andrea yielded to her superior\r\ncourage and energy.\r\n\r\nThe nuns of Santa Chiara when out of their convent do not usually wear\r\ntheir monastic habit, but dress simply in a black gown. Maria, however,\r\nhad brought her nun\u2019s habiliments with her, and, thinking thus to\r\nimpress the soldiers with respect, she now put them on. She received her\r\nfather\u2019s benediction, and, asking that of the Virgin and the saints, she\r\ndeparted on her expedition. Ascending the hill, she was soon stopped by\r\nthe sentinels. She asked to see their commanding officer, and being\r\nconducted to him, she announced herself as the sister of the unfortunate\r\ngirl who had been captured the night before. The officer, who had\r\nreceived her with carelessness, now changed countenance: his serious\r\nlook frightened Maria, who clasped her hands, exclaiming, \u201cYou have not\r\ninjured the child! she is safe!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is safe\u2014now,\u201d he replied with hesitation; \u201cbut there is no hope of\r\npardon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHoly Virgin, have mercy on her! What will be done to her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have received strict orders: in two hours she dies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! no!\u201d exclaimed Maria impetuously, \u201cthat cannot be! You cannot be so\r\nwicked as to murder a child like her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is old enough, madame,\u201d said the officer, \u201cto know that she ought\r\nnot to disobey orders; mine are so strict, that were she but nine years\r\nold, she dies.\u201d\r\n\r\nThese terrible words stung Maria to fresh resolution: she entreated for\r\nmercy; she knelt; she vowed that she would not depart without her\r\nsister; she appealed to Heaven and the saints. The officer, though\r\ncold-hearted, was good-natured and courteous, and he assured her with\r\nthe utmost gentleness that her supplications were of no avail; that were\r\nthe criminal his own daughter he must enforce his orders. As a sole\r\nconcession, he permitted her to see her sister. Despair inspired the nun\r\nwith energy; she almost ran up the hill, out-speeding her guide: they\r\ncrossed a folding of the hills to a little sheep-cot, where sentinels\r\nparaded before the door. There was no glass to the windows, so the\r\nshutters were shut; and when Maria first went in from the bright\r\ndaylight she hardly saw the slight figure of her sister leaning against\r\nthe wall, her dark hair fallen below her waist, her head sunk on her\r\nbosom, over which her arms were folded. She started wildly as the door\r\nopened, saw her sister, and sprang with a piercing shriek into her arms.\r\n\r\nThey were left alone together: Anina uttered a thousand frantic\r\nexclamations, beseeching her sister to save her, and shuddering at the\r\nnear approach of her fate. Maria had felt herself, since their mother\u2019s\r\ndeath, the natural protectress and support of her sister, and she never\r\ndeemed herself so called on to fulfil this character as now that the\r\ntrembling girl clasped her neck,\u2014her tears falling on her cheeks, and\r\nher choked voice entreating her to save her. The thought\u2014O could I\r\nsuffer instead of you! was in her heart, and she was about to express\r\nit, when it suggested another idea, on which she was resolved to act.\r\nFirst she soothed Anina by her promises, then glanced round the cot;\r\nthey were quite alone: she went to the window, and through a crevice saw\r\nthe soldiers conversing at some distance. \u201cYes, dearest sister,\u201d she\r\ncried, \u201cI will\u2014I can save you\u2014quick\u2014we must change dresses\u2014there is no\r\ntime to be lost I\u2014you must escape in my habit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you remain to die?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey dare not murder the innocent, a nun! Fear not for me\u2014I am safe.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnina easily yielded to her sister, but her fingers trembled; every\r\nstring she touched she entangled. Maria was perfectly self-possessed,\r\npale, but calm. She tied up her sister\u2019s long hair, and adjusted her\r\nveil over it so as to conceal it; she unlaced her bodice, and arranged\r\nthe folds of her own habit on her with the greatest care\u2014then more\r\nhastily she assumed the dress of her sister, putting on, after a lapse\r\nof many years, her native contadina costume. Anina stood by, weeping and\r\nhelpless, hardly hearing her sister\u2019s injunctions to return speedily to\r\ntheir father, and under his guidance to seek sanctuary. The guard now\r\nopened the door. Anina clung to her sister in terror, while she, in\r\nsoothing tones, entreated her to calm herself.\r\n\r\nThe soldier said they must delay no longer, for the priest had arrived\r\nto confess the prisoner.\r\n\r\nTo Anina the idea of confession associated with death was terrible; to\r\nMaria it brought hope. She whispered, in a smothered voice, \u201cThe priest\r\nwill protect me\u2014fear not\u2014hasten to our father!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnina almost mechanically obeyed: weeping, with her handkerchief placed\r\nunaffectedly before her face, she passed the soldiers; they closed the\r\ndoor on the prisoner, who hastened to the window, and saw her sister\r\ndescend the hill with tottering steps, till she was lost behind some\r\nrising ground. The nun fell on her knees\u2014cold dew bathed her brow,\r\ninstinctively she feared: the French had shown small respect for the\r\nmonastic character; they destroyed the convents and desecrated the\r\nchurches. Would they be merciful to her, and spare the innocent? Alas!\r\nwas not Anina innocent also? Her sole crime had been disobeying an\r\narbitrary command, and she had done the same.\r\n\r\n\u201cCourage!\u201d cried Maria; \u201cperhaps I am fitter to die than my sister is.\r\nGesu, pardon me my sins, but I do not believe that I shall out live this\r\nday!\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Anina descended the hill slowly and trembling. She\r\nfeared discovery,\u2014she feared for her sister,\u2014and above all, at the\r\npresent moment, she feared the reproaches and anger of her father. By\r\ndwelling on this last idea, it became exaggerated into excessive terror,\r\nand she determined, instead of returning to her home, to make a circuit\r\namong the hills, to find her way by herself to Albano, where she trusted\r\nto find protection from her pastor and confessor. She avoided the open\r\npaths, and following rather the direction she wished to pursue than any\r\nbeaten road, she passed along nearer to Rocca Giovane than she\r\nanticipated. She looked up at its ruined houses and bell-less steeple,\r\nstraining her eyes to catch a glimpse of him, the author of all her\r\nills. A low but distinct whistle reached her ear, not far off; she\r\nstarted,\u2014she remembered that on the night when she last saw Domenico a\r\nnote like that had called him from her side; the sound was echoed and\r\nre-echoed from other quarters; she stood aghast, her bosom heaving, her\r\nhands clasped. First she saw a dark and ragged head of hair, shadowing\r\ntwo fiercely gleaming eyes, rise from beneath a bush. She screamed, but\r\nbefore she could repeat her scream three men leapt from behind a rock,\r\nsecured her arms, threw a cloth over her face, and hurried her up the\r\nacclivity. Their talk, as she went along, informed her of the horror and\r\ndanger of her situation.\r\n\r\nPity, they said, that the holy father and some of his red stockings did\r\nnot command the troops: with a nun in their hands, they might obtain any\r\nterms. Coarse jests passed as they dragged their victim towards their\r\nruined village. The paving of the street told her when they arrived at\r\nRocca Giovane, and the change of atmosphere that they entered a house.\r\nThey unbandaged her eyes: the scene was squalid and miserable, the walls\r\nragged and black with smoke, the floor strewn with offals and dirt; a\r\nrude table and broken bench was all the furniture; and the leaves of\r\nIndian corn, heaped high in one corner, served, it seemed, for a bed,\r\nfor a man lay on it, his head buried in his folded arms. Anina looked\r\nround on her savage hosts: their countenances expressed every variety of\r\nbrutal ferocity, now rendered more dreadful from gaunt famine and\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, there is none who will save me!\u201d she cried. The voice startled the\r\nman who was lying on the floor; he lept up\u2014it was Domenico: Domenico, so\r\nchanged, with sunk cheeks and eyes, matted hair, and looks whose\r\nwildness and desperation differed little from the dark countenances\r\naround him. Could this be her lover?\r\n\r\nHis recognition and surprise at her dress led to an explanation. When\r\nthe robbers first heard that their prey was no prize, they were\r\nmortified and angry; but when she related the danger she had incurred by\r\nendeavouring to bring them food, they swore with horrid oaths that no\r\nharm should befall her, but that if she liked she might make one of them\r\nin all honour and equality. The innocent girl shuddered. \u201cLet me go,\u201d\r\nshe cried; \u201clet me only escape and hide myself in a convent for ever!\u201d\r\n\r\nDomenico looked at her in agony. \u201cYes, poor child,\u201d he said; \u201cgo save\r\nyourself: God grant no evil befall you; the ruin is too wide already.\u201d\r\nThen turning eagerly to his comrades, he continued: \u201cYou hear her story.\r\nShe was to have been shot for bringing food to us: her sister has\r\nsubstituted herself in her place. We know the French; one victim is to\r\nthem as good as another: Maria dies in their hands. Let us save her. Our\r\ntime is up; we must fall like men, or starve like dogs: we have still\r\nammunition, still some strength left. To arms! let us rush on the\r\npoltroons, free their prisoner, and escape or die!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere needed but an impulse like this to urge the outlaws to desperate\r\nresolves. They prepared their arms with looks of ferocious\r\ndetermination. Domenico, meanwhile, led Anina out of the house, to the\r\nverge of the hill, inquiring whether she intended to go. On her saying\r\nto Albano, he observed, \u201cThat were hardly safe; be guided by me, I\r\nentreat you: take these piastres, hire the first conveyance you find,\r\nhasten to Rome, to the convent of Santa Chiara: for pity\u2019s sake, do not\r\nlinger in this neighbourhood.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will obey your injunctions, Domenico,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut I cannot\r\ntake your money; it has cost you too dear: fear not, I shall arrive\r\nsafely at Rome without that ill-fated silver.\u201d\r\n\r\nDomenico\u2019s comrades now called loudly to him: he had no time to urge his\r\nrequest; he threw the despised dollars at her feet.\r\n\r\n\u201cNina, adieu for ever,\u201d he said: \u201cmay you love again more happily!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever!\u201d she replied. \u201cGod has saved me in this dress; it were sacrilege\r\nto change it: I shall never quit Santa Chiara.\u201d\r\n\r\nDomenico had led her a part of the way down the rock; his comrades\r\nappeared at the top, calling to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cGesu save you!\u201d cried he: \u201creach the convent\u2014Maria shall join you there\r\nbefore night. Farewell!\u201d He hastily kissed her hand, and sprang up the\r\nacclivity to rejoin his impatient friends.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Andrea had waited long for the return of his children.\r\nThe leafless trees and bright clear atmosphere permitted every object to\r\nbe visible, but he saw no trace of them on the hill-side; the shadows of\r\nthe dial showed noon to be passed, when, with uncontrollable impatience,\r\nhe began to climb the hill, towards the spot where Anina had been taken.\r\nThe path he pursued was in part the same that this unhappy girl had\r\ntaken on her way to Rome. The father and daughter met: the old man saw\r\nthe nun\u2019s dress, and saw her unaccompanied: she covered her face with\r\nher hands in a transport of fear and shame; but when, mistaking her for\r\nMaria, he asked in a tone of anguish for his youngest darling, her arms\r\nfell\u2014she dared not raise her eyes, which streamed with tears.\r\n\r\n\u201cUnhappy girl!\u201d exclaimed Andrea, \u201cwhere is your sister?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the cottage prison, now discernible near the summit of a\r\nsteep acclivity. \u201cShe is safe,\u201d she replied: \u201cshe saved me; but they\r\ndare not murder her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHeaven bless her for this good deed!\u201d exclaimed the old man fervently;\r\n\u201cbut you hasten on your way, and I will go in search of her.\u201d\r\n\r\nEach proceeded on an opposite path. The old man wound up the hill, now\r\nin view, and now losing sight of the hut where his child was captive: he\r\nwas aged, and the way was steep. Once, when the closing of the hill hid\r\nthe point towards which he for ever strained his eyes, a single shot was\r\nfired in that direction: his staff fell from his hands, his knees\r\ntrembled and failed him; several minutes of dead silence elapsed before\r\nhe recovered himself sufficiently to proceed: full of fears he went on,\r\nand at the next turn saw the cot again. A party of soldiers were on the\r\nopen space before it, drawn up in a line as if expecting an attack. In a\r\nfew moments from above them shots were fired, which they returned, and\r\nthe whole was enveloped and veiled in smoke. Still Andrea climbed the\r\nhill, eager to discover what had become of his child: the firing\r\ncontinued quick and hot. Now and then, in the pauses of musketry and the\r\nanswering echoes of the mountains, he heard a funeral chant; presently,\r\nbefore he was aware, at a turning of the hill, he met a company of\r\npriests and contadini, carrying a large cross and a bier. The miserable\r\nfather rushed forward with frantic impatience; the awe-struck peasants\r\nset down their load\u2014the face was uncovered, and the wretched man fell\r\nhelpless on the corpse of his murdered child.\r\n\r\nThe Countess Atanasia paused, overcome by the emotions inspired by the\r\nhistory she related. A long pause ensued: at length one of the party\r\nobserved, \u201cMaria, then, was the sacrifice to her goodness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe French,\u201d said the countess, \u201cdid not venerate her holy vocation;\r\none peasant girl to them was the same as another. The immolation of any\r\nvictim suited their purpose of awe-striking the peasantry. Scarcely,\r\nhowever, had the shot entered her heart, and her blameless spirit been\r\nreceived by the saints in Paradise, when Domenico and his followers\r\nrushed down the hill to avenge her and themselves. The contest was\r\nfurious and bloody; twenty French soldiers fell, and not one of the\r\nbanditti escaped,\u2014Domenico, the foremost of the assailants, being the\r\nfirst to fall.\u201d\r\n\r\nI asked, \u201cAnd where are now Anina and her father?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may see them, if you will,\u201d said the countess, \u201con your return to\r\nRome. She is a nun of Santa Chiara. Constant acts of benevolence and\r\npiety have inspired her with calm and resignation. Her prayers are daily\r\nput up for Domenico\u2019s soul, and she hopes, through the intercession of\r\nthe Virgin, to rejoin him in the other world.\r\n\r\n\u201cAndrea is very old; he has outlived the memory of his sufferings; but\r\nhe derives comfort from the filial attentions of his surviving daughter.\r\nBut when I look at his cottage on this lake, and remember the happy\r\nlaughing face of Anina among the vines, I shudder at the recollection of\r\nthe passion that has made her cheeks pale, her thoughts for ever\r\nconversant with death, her only wish to find repose in the grave.\u201d\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\n                          _FERDINANDO EBOLI._\r\n\r\n\r\nDURING this quiet time of peace we are fast forgetting the exciting and\r\nastonishing events of the Napoleonic wars; and the very names of\r\nEurope\u2019s conquerors are becoming antiquated to the ears of our children.\r\nThose were more romantic days than these; for the revulsions occasioned\r\nby revolution or invasion were full of romance; and travellers in those\r\ncountries in which these scenes had place hear strange and wonderful\r\nstories, whose truth so much resembles fiction, that, while interested\r\nin the narration, we never give implicit credence to the narrator. Of\r\nthis kind is a tale I heard at Naples. The fortunes of war perhaps did\r\nnot influence its actors, yet it appears improbable that any\r\ncircumstances so out of the usual routine could have had place under the\r\ngarish daylight that peace sheds upon the world.\r\n\r\nWhen Murat, then called Gioacchino, king of Naples, raised his Italian\r\nregiments, several young nobles, who had before been scarcely more than\r\nvine-dressers on the soil, were inspired with a love of arms, and\r\npresented themselves as candidates for military honours. Among these was\r\nthe young Count Eboli. The father of this youthful noble had followed\r\nFerdinand to Sicily; but his estates lay principally near Salerno, and\r\nhe was naturally desirous of preserving them; while the hopes that the\r\nFrench government held out of glory and prosperity to his country made\r\nhim often regret that he had followed his legitimate but imbecile king\r\nto exile. When he died, therefore, he recommended his son to return to\r\nNaples, to present himself to his old and tried friend, the Marchese\r\nSpina, who held a high office in Murat\u2019s government, and through his\r\nmeans to reconcile himself to the new king. All this was easily\r\nachieved. The young and gallant Count was permitted to possess his\r\npatrimony; and, as a further pledge of good fortune, he was betrothed to\r\nthe only child of the Marchese Spina. The nuptials were deferred till\r\nthe end of the ensuing campaign.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the army was put in motion, and Count Eboli only obtained such\r\nshort leave of absence as permitted him to visit for a few hours the\r\nvilla of his future father-in-law, there to take leave of him and his\r\naffianced bride. The villa was situated on one of the Apennines to the\r\nnorth of Salerno, and looked down, over the plain of Calabria, in which\r\nP\u00e6stum is situated, on to the blue Mediterranean. A precipice on one\r\nside, a brawling mountain torrent, and a thick grove of ilex, added\r\nbeauty to the sublimity of its site. Count Eboli ascended the\r\nmountain-path in all the joy of youth and hope. His stay was brief. An\r\nexhortation and a blessing from the Marchese, a tender farewell, graced\r\nby gentle tears, from the fair Adalinda, were the recollections he was\r\nto bear with him, to inspire him with courage and hope in danger and\r\nabsence. The sun had just sunk behind the distant isle of Istria, when,\r\nkissing his lady\u2019s hand, he said a last \u201cAddio,\u201d and with slower steps,\r\nand more melancholy mien, rode down the mountain on his road to Naples.\r\n\r\nThat same night Adalinda retired early to her apartment, dismissing her\r\nattendants; and then, restless from mingled fear and hope, she threw\r\nopen the glass-door that led to a balcony looking over the edge of the\r\nhill upon the torrent, whose loud rushing often lulled her to sleep, but\r\nwhose waters were concealed from sight by the ilex trees, which lifted\r\ntheir topmost branches above the guarding parapet of the balcony.\r\n\r\nLeaning her cheek upon her hand, she thought of the dangers her lover\r\nwould encounter, of her loneliness the while, of his letters, and of his\r\nreturn. A rustling sound now caught her ear. Was it the breeze among the\r\nilex trees? Her own veil was unwaved by every wind, her tresses even,\r\nheavy in their own rich beauty only, were not lifted from her cheek.\r\nAgain those sounds. Her blood retreated to her heart, and her limbs\r\ntrembled. What could it mean? Suddenly the upper branches of the nearest\r\ntree were disturbed; they opened, and the faint starlight showed a man\u2019s\r\nfigure among them. He prepared to spring from his hold on to the wall.\r\nIt was a feat of peril. First the soft voice of her lover bade her \u201cFear\r\nnot,\u201d and on the next instant he was at her side, calming her terrors,\r\nand recalling her spirits, that almost left her gentle frame, from\r\nmingled surprise, dread, and joy. He encircled her waist with his arm,\r\nand pouring forth a thousand passionate expressions of love, she leant\r\non his shoulder, and wept from agitation, while he covered her hands\r\nwith kisses, and gazed on her with ardent adoration.\r\n\r\nThen in calmer mood they sat together; triumph and joy lighted up his\r\neyes, and a modest blush glowed on her cheek: for never before had she\r\nsat alone with him, nor heard unrestrained his impassioned assurances of\r\naffection. It was, indeed, Love\u2019s own hour. The stars trembled on the\r\nroof of his eternal temple; the dashing of the torrent, the mild summer\r\natmosphere, and the mysterious aspect of the darkened scenery, were all\r\nin unison to inspire security and voluptuous hope. They talked of how\r\ntheir hearts, through the medium of divine nature, might hold commune\r\nduring absence; of the joys of reunion, and of their prospect of perfect\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nThe moment at last arrived when he must depart. \u201cOne tress of this\r\nsilken hair,\u201d said he, raising one of the many curls that clustered on\r\nher neck. \u201cI will place it on my heart, a shield to protect me against\r\nthe swords and balls of the enemy.\u201d He drew his keen-edged dagger from\r\nits sheath. \u201cIll weapon for so gentle a deed,\u201d he said, severing the\r\nlock, and at the same moment many drops of blood fell fast on the fair\r\narm of the lady. He answered her fearful inquiries by showing a gash he\r\nhad awkwardly inflicted on his left hand. First he insisted on securing\r\nhis prize, and then he permitted her to bind his wound, which she did\r\nhalf laughing, half in sorrow, winding round his hand a riband loosened\r\nfrom her own arm. \u201cNow, farewell,\u201d he cried; \u201cI must ride twenty miles\r\nere dawn, and the descending Bear shows that midnight is past.\u201d His\r\ndescent was difficult, but he achieved it happily, and the stave of a\r\nsong\u2014whose soft sounds rose like the smoke of incense from an altar\u2014from\r\nthe dell below, to her impatient ear, assured her of his safety.\r\n\r\nAs is always the case when an account is gathered from eye-witnesses, I\r\nnever could ascertain the exact date of these events. They occurred,\r\nhowever, while Murat was king of Naples; and when he raised his Italian\r\nregiments, Count Eboli, as aforesaid, became a junior officer in them,\r\nand served with much distinction, though I cannot name either the\r\ncountry or the battle in which he acted so conspicuous a part that he\r\nwas on the spot promoted to a troop.\r\n\r\nNot long after this event, and while he was stationed in the north of\r\nItaly, Gioacchino, sending for him to headquarters late one evening,\r\nentrusted him with a confidential mission, across a country occupied by\r\nthe enemy\u2019s troops, to a town possessed by the French. It was necessary\r\nto undertake the expedition during the night, and he was expected to\r\nreturn on that succeeding the following day. The king himself gave him\r\nhis despatches and the word; and the noble youth, with modest firmness,\r\nprotested that he would succeed, or die, in the fulfilment of his trust.\r\n\r\nIt was already night, and the crescent moon was low in the west, when\r\nCount Ferdinando Eboli, mounting his favourite horse, at a quick gallop\r\ncleared the streets of the town; and then, following the directions\r\ngiven him, crossed the country among the fields planted with vines,\r\ncarefully avoiding the main road. It was a beauteous and still night;\r\ncalm and sleep occupied the earth; war, the blood-hound, slumbered; the\r\nspirit of love alone had life at that silent hour. Exulting in the hope\r\nof glory, our young hero commenced his journey, and visions of\r\naggrandizement and love formed his reveries. A distant sound roused him:\r\nhe checked his horse and listened; voices approached. When recognising\r\nthe speech of a German, he turned from the path he was following, to a\r\nstill straighter way. But again the tone of an enemy was heard, and the\r\ntrampling of horses. Eboli did not hesitate; he dismounted, tied his\r\nsteed to a tree, and, skirting along the enclosure of the field, trusted\r\nto escape thus unobserved. He succeeded after an hour\u2019s painful\r\nprogress, and arrived on the borders of a stream, which, as the boundary\r\nbetween two states, was the mark of his having finally escaped danger.\r\nDescending the steep bank of the river, which, with his horse, he might\r\nperhaps have forded, he now prepared to swim. He held his despatch in\r\none hand, threw away his cloak, and was about to plunge into the water,\r\nwhen from under the dark shade of the _argine_, which had concealed\r\nthem, he was suddenly arrested by unseen hands, cast on the ground,\r\nbound, gagged, and blinded, and then placed into a little boat, which\r\nwas sculled with infinite rapidity down the stream.\r\n\r\nThere seemed so much of premeditation in the act that it baffled\r\nconjecture, yet he must believe himself a prisoner to the Austrian.\r\nWhile, however, he still vainly reflected, the boat was moored, he was\r\nlifted out, and the change of atmosphere made him aware that they\r\nentered some house. With extreme care and celerity, yet in the utmost\r\nsilence, he was stripped of his clothes, and two rings he wore drawn\r\nfrom his fingers; other habiliments were thrown over him; and then no\r\ndeparting footstep was audible; but soon he heard the splash of a single\r\noar, and he felt himself alone. He lay perfectly unable to move, the\r\nonly relief his captor or captors had afforded him being the exchange of\r\nthe gag for a tightly-bound handkerchief. For hours he thus remained,\r\nwith a tortured mind, bursting with rage, impatience, and\r\ndisappointment; now writhing as well as he could in his endeavours to\r\nfree himself, now still in despair. His despatches were taken away, and\r\nthe period was swiftly passing when he could by his presence have\r\nremedied in some degree this evil. The morning dawned, and, though the\r\nfull glare of the sun could not visit his eyes, he felt it play upon his\r\nlimbs. As the day advanced, hunger preyed on him, and, though amidst the\r\nvisitation of mightier, he at first disdained this minor, evil, towards\r\nevening it became, in spite of himself, the predominant sensation. Night\r\napproached, and the fear that he should remain, and even starve, in this\r\nunvisited solitude had more than once thrilled through his frame, when\r\nfeminine voices and a child\u2019s gay laugh met his ear. He heard persons\r\nenter the apartment, and he was asked in his native language, while the\r\nligature was taken from his mouth, the cause of his present situation.\r\nHe attributed it to banditti. His bonds were quickly cut, and his banded\r\neyes restored to sight. It was long before he recovered himself. Water\r\nbrought from the stream, however, was some refreshment, and by degrees\r\nhe resumed the use of his senses, and saw that he was in a dilapidated\r\nshepherd\u2019s cot, with no one near him save the peasant girl and a child,\r\nwho had liberated him. They rubbed his ankles and wrists, and the little\r\nfellow offered him some bread and eggs, after which refreshment and an\r\nhour\u2019s repose Ferdinando felt himself sufficiently restored to revolve\r\nhis adventure in his mind, and to determine on the conduct he was to\r\npursue.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the dress which had been given him in exchange for that\r\nwhich he had worn. It was of the plainest and meanest description. Still\r\nno time was to be lost; and he felt assured that the only step he could\r\ntake was to return with all speed to the headquarters of the Neapolitan\r\narmy, and inform the king of his disasters and his loss.\r\n\r\nIt were long to follow his backward steps, and to tell all of\r\nindignation and disappointment that swelled his heart. He walked\r\npainfully but resolutely all night, and by three in the morning entered\r\nthe town where Gioacchino then was. He was challenged by the sentinels;\r\nhe gave the word confided to him by Murat, and was instantly made\r\nprisoner by the soldiers. He declared to them his name and rank, and the\r\nnecessity he was under of immediately seeing the king. He was taken to\r\nthe guard-house, and the officer on duty there listened with contempt to\r\nhis representations, telling him that Count Ferdinando Eboli had\r\nreturned three hours before, ordering him to be confined for further\r\nexamination as a spy. Eboli loudly insisted that some impostor had taken\r\nhis name; and while he related the story of his capture, another officer\r\ncame in, who recognised his person; other individuals acquainted with\r\nhim joined the party; and as the impostor had been seen by none but the\r\nofficer of the night, his tale gained ground.\r\n\r\nA young Frenchman of superior rank, who had orders to attend the king\r\nearly in the morning, carried a report of what was going forward to\r\nMurat himself. The tale was so strange that the king sent for the young\r\nCount; and then, in spite of having seen and believed in his counterfeit\r\na few hours before, and having received from him an account of his\r\nmission, which had been faithfully executed, the appearance of the youth\r\nstaggered him, and he commanded the presence of him who, as Count Eboli,\r\nhad appeared before him a few hours previously. As Ferdinand stood\r\nbeside the king, his eye glanced at a large and splendid mirror. His\r\nmatted hair, his bloodshot eyes, his haggard looks, and torn and mean\r\ndress, derogated from the nobility of his appearance; and still less did\r\nhe appear like the magnificent Count Eboli, when, to his utter confusion\r\nand astonishment, his counterfeit stood beside him.\r\n\r\nHe was perfect in all the outward signs that denoted high birth; and so\r\nlike him whom he represented, that it would have been impossible to\r\ndiscern one from the other apart. The same chestnut hair clustered on\r\nhis brow; the sweet and animated hazel eyes were the same; the one voice\r\nwas the echo of the other. The composure and dignity of the pretender\r\ngained the suffrages of those around. When he was told of the strange\r\nappearance of another Count Eboli, he laughed in a frank good-humoured\r\nmanner, and, turning to Ferdinand, said, \u201cYou honour me much in\r\nselecting me for your personation; but there are two or three things I\r\nlike about myself so well, that you must excuse my unwillingness to\r\nexchange myself for you.\u201d Ferdinand would have answered, but the false\r\nCount, with greater haughtiness, turning to the king, said, \u201cWill your\r\nmajesty decide between us? I cannot bandy words with a fellow of this\r\nsort.\u201d Irritated by scorn, Ferdinand demanded leave to challenge the\r\npretender; who said, that if the king and his brother-officers did not\r\nthink that he should degrade himself and disgrace the army by going out\r\nwith a common vagabond, he was willing to chastise him, even at the\r\nperil of his own life. But the king, after a few more questions, feeling\r\nassured that the unhappy noble was an impostor, in severe and menacing\r\nterms reprehended him for his insolence, telling him that he owed it to\r\nhis mercy alone that he was not executed as a spy, ordering him\r\ninstantly to be conducted without the walls of the town, with threats of\r\nweighty punishment if he ever dared to subject his impostures to further\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nIt requires a strong imagination, and the experience of much misery,\r\nfully to enter into Ferdinand\u2019s feelings. From high rank, glory, hope,\r\nand love, he was hurled to utter beggary and disgrace. The insulting\r\nwords of his triumphant rival, and the degrading menaces of his so\r\nlately gracious sovereign, rang in his ears; every nerve in his frame\r\nwrithed with agony. But, fortunately for the endurance of human life,\r\nthe worst misery in early youth is often but a painful dream, which we\r\ncast off when slumber quits our eyes. After a struggle with intolerable\r\nanguish, hope and courage revived in his heart. His resolution was\r\nquickly made. He would return to Naples, relate his story to the\r\nMarchese Spina, and through his influence obtain at least an impartial\r\nhearing from the king. It was not, however, in his peculiar situation,\r\nan easy task to put his determination into effect. He was penniless; his\r\ndress bespoke poverty; he had neither friend nor kinsman near, but such\r\nas would behold in him the most impudent of swindlers. Still his courage\r\ndid not fail him. The kind Italian soil, in the autumnal season now\r\nadvanced, furnished him with chestnuts, arbutus berries, and grapes. He\r\ntook the most direct road over the hills, avoiding towns, and indeed\r\nevery habitation; travelling principally in the night, when, except in\r\ncities, the officers of government had retired from their stations. How\r\nhe succeeded in getting from one end of Italy to the other it is\r\ndifficult to say; but certain it is, that, after the interval of a few\r\nweeks, he presented himself at the Villa Spina.\r\n\r\nWith considerable difficulty he obtained admission to the presence of\r\nthe Marchese, who received him standing, with an inquiring look, not at\r\nall recognising the noble youth. Ferdinand requested a private\r\ninterview, for there were several visitors present. His voice startled\r\nthe Marchese, who complied, taking him into another apartment. Here\r\nFerdinand disclosed himself, and, with rapid and agitated utterance, was\r\nrelating the history of his misfortunes, when the tramp of horses was\r\nheard, the great bell rang, and a domestic announced \u201cCount Ferdinando\r\nEboli.\u201d \u201cIt is himself,\u201d cried the youth, turning pale. The words were\r\nstrange, and they appeared still more so when the person announced\r\nentered; the perfect semblance of the young noble, whose name he\r\nassumed, as he had appeared when last at his departure, he trod the\r\npavement of the hall. He inclined his head gracefully to the baron,\r\nturning with a glance of some surprise, but more disdain, towards\r\nFerdinand, exclaiming, \u201cThou here!\u201d\r\n\r\nFerdinand drew himself up to his full height. In spite of fatigue,\r\nill-fare, and coarse garments, his manner was full of dignity. The\r\nMarchese looked at him fixedly, and started as he marked his proud mien,\r\nand saw in his expressive features the very face of Eboli. But again he\r\nwas perplexed when he turned and discerned, as in a mirror, the same\r\ncountenance reflected by the new-comer, who underwent this scrutiny\r\nsomewhat impatiently. In brief and scornful words he told the Marchese\r\nthat this was a second attempt in the intruder to impose himself as\r\nCount Eboli; that the trick had failed before, and would again; adding,\r\nlaughing, that it was hard to be brought to prove himself to be himself,\r\nagainst the assertion of a _briccone_, whose likeness to him, and\r\nmatchless impudence, were his whole stock-in-trade.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, my good fellow,\u201d continued he, sneeringly, \u201cyou put me out of\r\nconceit with myself, to think that one, apparently so like me, should\r\nget on no better in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe blood mounted into Ferdinand\u2019s cheeks on his enemy\u2019s bitter taunts;\r\nwith difficulty he restrained himself from closing with his foe, while\r\nthe words \u201ctraitorous impostor!\u201d burst from his lips. The baron\r\ncommanded the fierce youth to be silent, and, moved by a look that he\r\nremembered to be Ferdinand\u2019s, he said gently, \u201cBy your respect for me, I\r\nadjure you to be patient; fear not but that I will deal impartially.\u201d\r\nThen turning to the pretended Eboli, he added that he could not doubt\r\nbut that he was the true Count, and asked excuse for his previous\r\nindecision. At first the latter appeared angry, but at length he burst\r\ninto a laugh, and then, apologising for his ill-breeding, continued\r\nlaughing heartily at the perplexity of the Marchese. It is certain his\r\ngaiety gained more credit with his auditor than the indignant glances of\r\npoor Ferdinand. The false Count then said that, after the king\u2019s\r\nmenaces, he had entertained no expectation that the farce was to be\r\nplayed over again. He had obtained leave of absence, of which he\r\nprofited to visit his future father-in-law, after having spent a few\r\ndays in his own palazzo at Naples. Until now Ferdinand had listened\r\nsilently, with a feeling of curiosity, anxious to learn all he could of\r\nthe actions and motives of his rival; but at these last words he could\r\nno longer contain himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d cried he, \u201chast thou usurped my place in my own father\u2019s house,\r\nand dared assume my power in my ancestral halls?\u201d\r\n\r\nA gush of tears overpowered the youth; he hid his face in his hands.\r\nFierceness and pride lit up the countenance of the pretender.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the eternal God and the sacred cross, I swear,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cthat\r\npalace is my father\u2019s palace; those halls the halls of my ancestors!\u201d\r\n\r\nFerdinand looked up with surprise: \u201cAnd the earth opens not,\u201d he said,\r\n\u201cto swallow the perjured man.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe then, at the call of the Marchese, related his adventures, while\r\nscorn mantled on the features of his rival. The Marchese, looking at\r\nboth, could not free himself from doubt. He turned from one to the\r\nother: in spite of the wild and disordered appearance of poor Ferdinand,\r\nthere was something in him that forbade his friend to condemn him as the\r\nimpostor; but then it was utterly impossible to pronounce such the\r\ngallant and noble-looking youth, who could only be acknowledged as the\r\nreal Count by the disbelief of the other\u2019s tale. The Marchese, calling\r\nan attendant, sent for his fair daughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis decision,\u201d said he, \u201cshall be made over to the subtle judgment of\r\na woman, and the keen penetration of one who loves.\u201d\r\n\r\nBoth the youths now smiled\u2014the same smile; the same expression\u2014that of\r\nanticipated triumph. The baron was more perplexed than ever.\r\n\r\nAdalinda had heard of the arrival of Count Eboli, and entered,\r\nresplendent in youth and happiness. She turned quickly towards him who\r\nresembled most the person she expected to see; when a well-known voice\r\npronounced her name, and she gazed aghast on the double appearance of\r\nthe lover. Her father, taking her hand, briefly explained the mystery,\r\nand bade her assure herself which was her affianced husband.\r\n\r\n\u201cSignorina,\u201d said Ferdinand, \u201cdisdain me not because I appear before you\r\nthus in disgrace and misery. Your love, your goodness will restore me to\r\nprosperity and happiness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know not by what means,\u201d said the wondering girl, \u201cbut surely you are\r\nCount Eboli.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAdalinda,\u201d said the rival youth, \u201cwaste not your words on a villain.\r\nLovely and deceived one, I trust, trembling I say it, that I can with\r\none word assure you that I am Eboli.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAdalinda,\u201d said Ferdinand, \u201cI placed the nuptial ring on your finger;\r\nbefore God your vows were given to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe false Count approached the lady, and, bending one knee, took from\r\nhis heart a locket, enclosing hair tied with a green riband, which she\r\nrecognised to have worn, and pointed to a slight scar on his left hand.\r\n\r\nAdalinda blushed deeply, and, turning to her father, said, motioning\r\ntowards the kneeling youth,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is Ferdinand.\u201d\r\n\r\nAll protestations now from the unhappy Eboli were vain. The Marchese\r\nwould have cast him into a dungeon; but at the earnest request of his\r\nrival, he was not detained, but thrust ignominiously from the villa. The\r\nrage of a wild beast newly chained was less than the tempest of\r\nindignation that now filled the heart of Ferdinand. Physical suffering,\r\nfrom the fatigue and fasting, was added to his internal anguish; for\r\nsome hours madness, if that were madness which never forgets its ill,\r\npossessed him. In a tumult of feelings there was one predominant idea:\r\nit was to take possession of his father\u2019s house, and to try, by\r\nameliorating the fortuitous circumstances of his lot, to gain the upper\r\nhand of his adversary. He expended his remaining strength in reaching\r\nNaples, entered his family palace, and was received and acknowledged by\r\nhis astonished domestics.\r\n\r\nOne of his first acts was to take from a cabinet a miniature of his\r\nfather encircled with jewels, and to invoke the aid of the paternal\r\nspirit. Refreshment and a bath restored him to some of his usual\r\nstrength; and he looked forward with almost childish delight to one\r\nnight to be spent in peace under the roof of his father\u2019s house. This\r\nwas not permitted. Ere midnight the great bell sounded: his rival\r\nentered as master, with the Marchese Spina. The result may be divined.\r\nThe Marchese appeared more indignant than the false Eboli. He insisted\r\nthat the unfortunate youth should be imprisoned. The portrait, whose\r\nsetting was costly, found on him, proved him guilty of robbery. He was\r\ngiven into the hands of the police, and thrown into a dungeon. I will\r\nnot dwell on the subsequent scenes. He was tried by the tribunal,\r\ncondemned as guilty, and sentenced to the galleys for life.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the day when he was to be removed from the Neapolitan\r\nprison to work on the roads in Calabria, his rival visited him in his\r\ndungeon. For some moments both looked at the other in silence. The\r\nimpostor gazed on the prisoner with mingled pride and compassion: there\r\nwas evidently a struggle in his heart. The answering glance of Ferdinand\r\nwas calm, free, and dignified. He was not resigned to his hard fate, but\r\nhe disdained to make any exhibition of despair to his cruel and\r\nsuccessful foe. A spasm of pain seemed to wrench the bosom of the false\r\none; and he turned aside, striving to recover the hardness of heart\r\nwhich had hitherto supported him in the prosecution of his guilty\r\nenterprise. Ferdinand spoke first.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat would the triumphant criminal with his innocent victim?\u201d\r\n\r\nHis visitant replied haughtily, \u201cDo not address such epithets to me, or\r\nI leave you to your fate: I am that which I say I am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo me this boast!\u201d cried Ferdinand scornfully; \u201cbut perhaps these walls\r\nhave ears.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHeaven, at least, is not deaf,\u201d said the deceiver; \u201cfavouring Heaven,\r\nwhich knows and admits my claim. But a truce to this idle discussion.\r\nCompassion\u2014a distaste to see one so very like myself in such ill\r\ncondition\u2014a foolish whim, perhaps, on which you may congratulate\r\nyourself\u2014has led me hither. The bolts of your dungeon are drawn; here is\r\na purse of gold; fulfil one easy condition, and you are free.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that condition?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSign this paper.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe gave to Ferdinand a writing, containing a confession of his imputed\r\ncrimes. The hand of the guilty youth trembled as he gave it; there was\r\nconfusion in his mien, and a restless uneasy rolling of his eye.\r\nFerdinand wished in one mighty word, potent as lightning, loud as\r\nthunder, to convey his burning disdain of this proposal: but expression\r\nis weak, and calm is more full of power than storm. Without a word, he\r\ntore the paper in two pieces and threw them at the feet of his enemy.\r\n\r\nWith a sudden change of manner, his visitant conjured him, in voluble\r\nand impetuous terms, to comply. Ferdinand answered only by requesting to\r\nbe left alone. Now and then a half word broke uncontrollably from his\r\nlips; but he curbed himself. Yet he could not hide his agitation when,\r\nas an argument to make him yield, the false Count assured him that he\r\nwas already married to Adalinda. Bitter agony thrilled poor Ferdinand\u2019s\r\nframe; but he preserved a calm mien, and an unaltered resolution. Having\r\nexhausted every menace and every persuasion, his rival left him, the\r\npurpose for which he came unaccomplished. On the morrow, with many\r\nothers, the refuse of mankind, Count Ferdinando Eboli was led in chains\r\nto the unwholesome plains of Calabria, to work there at the roads.\r\n\r\nI must hurry over some of the subsequent events, for a detailed account\r\nof them would fill volumes. The assertion of the usurper of Ferdinand\u2019s\r\nright, that he was already married to Adalinda, was, like all else he\r\nsaid, false. The day was, however, fixed for their union, when the\r\nillness and the subsequent death of the Marchese Spina delayed its\r\ncelebration. Adalinda retired during the first months of mourning to a\r\ncastle belonging to her father not far from Arpino, a town of the\r\nkingdom of Naples, in the midst of the Apennines, about 50 miles from\r\nthe capital. Before she went, the deceiver tried to persuade her to\r\nconsent to a private marriage. He was probably afraid that, in the long\r\ninterval that was about to ensue before he could secure her, she would\r\ndiscover his imposture. Besides, a rumour had gone abroad that one of\r\nthe fellow-prisoners of Ferdinand, a noted bandit, had escaped, and that\r\nthe young count was his companion in flight. Adalinda, however, refused\r\nto comply with her lover\u2019s entreaties, and retired to her seclusion with\r\nan old aunt, who was blind and deaf, but an excellent duenna. The false\r\nEboli seldom visited his mistress; but he was a master in his art, and\r\nsubsequent events showed that he must have spent all his time,\r\ndisguised, in the vicinity of the castle. He contrived by various means,\r\nunsuspected at the moment, to have all Adalinda\u2019s servants changed for\r\ncreatures of his own; so that, without her being aware of the restraint,\r\nshe was, in fact, a prisoner in her own house. It is impossible to say\r\nwhat first awakened her suspicions concerning the deception put upon\r\nher. She was an Italian, with all the habitual quiescence and lassitude\r\nof her countrywomen in the ordinary routine of life, and with all their\r\nenergy and passion when roused. The moment the doubt darted into her\r\nmind she resolved to be assured. A few questions relative to scenes that\r\nhad passed between poor Ferdinand and herself sufficed for this. They\r\nwere asked so suddenly and pointedly that the pretender was thrown off\r\nhis guard; he looked confused, and stammered in his replies. Their eyes\r\nmet; he felt that he was detected, and she saw that he perceived her now\r\nconfirmed suspicions. A look such as is peculiar to an impostor\u2014a glance\r\nthat deformed his beauty, and filled his usually noble countenance with\r\nthe hideous lines of cunning and cruel triumph\u2014completed her faith in\r\nher own discernment. \u201cHow,\u201d she thought, \u201ccould I have mistaken this man\r\nfor my own gentle Eboli?\u201d Again their eyes met. The peculiar expression\r\nof his terrified her, and she hastily quitted the apartment.\r\n\r\nHer resolution was quickly formed. It was of no use to attempt to\r\nexplain her situation to her old aunt. She determined to depart\r\nimmediately for Naples, throw herself at the feet of Gioacchino, and to\r\nrelate and obtain credit for her strange history. But the time was\r\nalready lost when she could have executed this design. The contrivances\r\nof the deceiver were complete\u2014she found herself a prisoner. Excess of\r\nfear gave her boldness, if not courage. She sought her jailor. A few\r\nminutes before she had been a young and thoughtless girl, docile as a\r\nchild, and as unsuspecting; now she felt as if she had suddenly grown\r\nold in wisdom, and that the experience of years had been gained in that\r\nof a few seconds.\r\n\r\nDuring their interview she was wary and firm, while the instinctive\r\npower of innocence over guilt gave majesty to her demeanour. The\r\ncontriver of her ills for a moment cowered beneath her eye. At first he\r\nwould by no means allow that he was not the person he pretended to be,\r\nbut the energy and eloquence of truth bore down his artifice, so that,\r\nat length driven into a corner, he turned\u2014a stag at bay. Then it was her\r\nturn to quail, for the superior energy of a man gave him the mastery. He\r\ndeclared the truth: he was the elder brother of Ferdinand, a natural son\r\nof the old Count Eboli. His mother, who had been wronged, never forgave\r\nher injurer, and bred her son in deadly hate for his parent, and a\r\nbelief that the advantages enjoyed by his more fortunate brother were\r\nrightfully his own. His education was rude; but he had an Italian\u2019s\r\nsubtle talents, swiftness of perception, and guileful arts.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would blanch your cheek,\u201d he said to his trembling auditress, \u201ccould\r\nI describe all that I have suffered to achieve my purpose. I would trust\r\nto none\u2014I executed all myself. It was a glorious triumph, but due to my\r\nperseverance and my fortitude, when I and my usurping brother stood\u2014I,\r\nthe noble, he, the degraded outcast\u2014before our sovereign.\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving rapidly detailed his history, he now sought to win the favourable\r\near of Adalinda, who stood with averted and angry looks. He tried by the\r\nvaried shows of passion and tenderness to move her heart. Was he not, in\r\ntruth, the object of her love? Was it not he who scaled her balcony at\r\nVilla Spina? He recalled scenes of mutual overflow of feeling to her\r\nmind, thus urging arguments the most potent with a delicate woman. Pure\r\nblushes tinged her cheek, but horror of the deceiver predominated over\r\nevery other sentiment. He swore that as soon as they should be united he\r\nwould free Ferdinand, and bestow competency, nay, if so she willed it,\r\nhalf his possessions on him. She coldly replied, that she would rather\r\nshare the chains of the innocent, and misery, than link herself with\r\nimposture and crime. She demanded her liberty; but the untamed and even\r\nferocious nature that had borne the deceiver through his career of crime\r\nnow broke forth, and he invoked fearful imprecations on his head if she\r\never quitted the castle except as his wife. His look of conscious power\r\nand unbridled wickedness terrified her; her flashing eyes spoke\r\nabhorrence. It would have been far easier for her to have died than have\r\nyielded the smallest point to a man who had made her feel for one moment\r\nhis irresistible power, arising from her being an unprotected woman,\r\nwholly in his hands. She left him, feeling as if she had just escaped\r\nfrom the impending sword of an assassin.\r\n\r\nOne hour\u2019s deliberation suggested to her a method of escape from her\r\nterrible situation. In a wardrobe at the castle lay, in their pristine\r\ngloss, the habiliments of a page of her mother, who had died suddenly,\r\nleaving these unworn relics of his station. Dressing herself in these,\r\nshe tied up her dark shining hair, and even, with a somewhat bitter\r\nfeeling, girded on the slight sword that appertained to the costume.\r\nThen, through a private passage leading from her own apartment to the\r\nchapel of the castle, she glided with noiseless steps, long after the\r\nAve Maria, sounded at four o\u2019clock, had, on a November night, given\r\ntoken that half an hour had passed since the setting of the sun. She\r\npossessed the key of the chapel door\u2014it opened at her touch; she closed\r\nit behind her, and she was free. The pathless hills were around her, the\r\nstarry heavens above, and a cold wintry breeze murmured around the\r\ncastle walls; but fear of her enemy conquered every other fear, and she\r\ntripped lightly on in a kind of ecstasy for many a long hour over the\r\nstony mountain path\u2014she, who had never before walked more than a mile or\r\ntwo from home at any time in her life\u2014till her feet were blistered, her\r\nslight shoes cut through, her way utterly lost. At morning\u2019s dawn she\r\nfound herself in the midst of the wild ilex-covered Apennines, and\r\nneither habitation nor human being apparent.\r\n\r\nShe was hungry and weary. She had brought gold and jewels with her; but\r\nhere were no means of exchanging these for food. She remembered stories\r\nof banditti, but none could be so ruffian-like and cruel as him from\r\nwhom she fled. This thought, a little rest, and a draught of water from\r\na pure mountain-spring, restored her to some portion of courage, and she\r\ncontinued her journey. Noonday approached; and, in the south of Italy,\r\nthe noonday sun, when unclouded, even in November, is oppressively warm,\r\nespecially to an Italian woman, who never exposes herself to its beams.\r\nFaintness came over her. There appeared recesses in the mountain sides\r\nalong which she was travelling, grown over with bay and arbutus: she\r\nentered one of these, there to repose. It was deep, and led to another\r\nthat opened into a spacious cavern lighted from above: there were cates,\r\ngrapes, and a flagon of wine on a rough-hewn table. She looked fearfully\r\naround, but no inhabitant appeared. She placed herself at the table,\r\nand, half in dread, ate of the food presented to her; and then sat, her\r\nelbow on the table, her head resting on her little snow-white hand, her\r\ndark hair shading her brow and clustering round her throat. An\r\nappearance of languor and fatigue was diffused through her attitude,\r\nwhile her soft black eyes filled at intervals with large tears as,\r\npitying herself, she recurred to the cruel circumstances of her lot. Her\r\nfanciful but elegant dress, her feminine form, her beauty and her grace,\r\nas she sat pensive and alone in the rough unhewn cavern, formed a\r\npicture a poet would describe with delight, an artist love to paint.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe seemed a being of another world; a seraph, all light and beauty: a\r\nGanymede, escaped from his thrall above to his natal Ida. It was long\r\nbefore I recognised, looking down on her from the opening hill, my lost\r\nAdalinda.\u201d Thus spoke the young Count Eboli, when he related this story;\r\nfor its end was as romantic as its commencement.\r\n\r\nWhen Ferdinando had arrived, a galley-slave in Calabria, he found\r\nhimself coupled with a bandit, a brave fellow, who abhorred his chains,\r\nfrom love of freedom, as much as his fellow-prisoner did, from all the\r\ncombination of disgrace and misery they brought upon him. Together they\r\ndevised a plan of escape, and succeeded in effecting it. On their road,\r\nFerdinand related his story to the outlaw, who encouraged him to hope\r\nfor a favourable turn of fate; and meanwhile invited and persuaded the\r\ndesperate man to share his fortunes as a robber among the wild hills of\r\nCalabria.\r\n\r\nThe cavern where Adalinda had taken refuge was one of their fastnesses,\r\nwhither they betook themselves at periods of imminent danger for safety\r\nonly, as no booty could be collected in that unpeopled solitude; and\r\nthere, one afternoon, returning from the chase, they found the\r\nwandering, fearful, solitary, fugitive girl; and never was lighthouse\r\nmore welcome to tempest-tossed sailor than was her own Ferdinand to his\r\nlady-love.\r\n\r\nFortune, now tired of persecuting the young noble, favoured him still\r\nfurther. The story of the lovers interested the bandit chief, and\r\npromise of reward secured him. Ferdinand persuaded Adalinda to remain\r\none night in the cave, and on the following morning they prepared to\r\nproceed to Naples; but at the moment of their departure they were\r\nsurprised by an unexpected visitant: the robbers brought in a\r\nprisoner\u2014it was the impostor. Missing on the morrow her who was the\r\npledge of his safety and success, but assured that she could not have\r\nwandered far, he despatched emissaries in all directions to seek her;\r\nand himself, joining in the pursuit, followed the road she had taken,\r\nand was captured by these lawless men, who expected rich ransom from one\r\nwhose appearance denoted rank and wealth. When they discovered who their\r\nprisoner was, they generously delivered him up into his brother\u2019s hands.\r\n\r\nFerdinand and Adalinda proceeded to Naples. On their arrival, she\r\npresented herself to Queen Caroline; and, through her, Murat heard with\r\nastonishment the device that had been practised on him. The young Count\r\nwas restored to his honours and possessions, and within a few months\r\nafterwards was united to his betrothed bride.\r\n\r\nThe compassionate nature of the Count and Countess led them to interest\r\nthemselves warmly in the fate of Ludovico, whose subsequent career was\r\nmore honourable but less fortunate. At the intercession of his relative,\r\nGioacchino permitted him to enter the army, where he distinguished\r\nhimself, and obtained promotion. The brothers were at Moscow together,\r\nand mutually assisted each other during the horrors of the retreat. At\r\none time overcome by drowsiness, the mortal symptom resulting from\r\nexcessive cold, Ferdinand lingered behind his comrades; but Ludovico,\r\nrefusing to leave him, dragged him on in spite of himself, till,\r\nentering a village, food and fire restored him, and his life was saved.\r\nOn another evening, when wind and sleet added to the horror of their\r\nsituation, Ludovico, after many ineffective struggles, slid from his\r\nhorse lifeless; Ferdinand was at his side, and, dismounting, endeavoured\r\nby every means in his power to bring back pulsation to his stagnant\r\nblood. His comrades went forward, and the young Count was left alone\r\nwith his dying brother in the white boundless waste. Once Ludovico\r\nopened his eyes and recognised him; he pressed his hand, and his lips\r\nmoved to utter a blessing as he died. At that moment the welcome sounds\r\nof the enemy\u2019s approach roused Ferdinand from the despair into which his\r\ndreadful situation plunged him. He was taken prisoner, and his life was\r\nthus saved. When Napoleon went to Elba, he, with many others of his\r\ncountrymen, was liberated, and returned to Naples.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III.\r\n\r\n                            _THE EVIL EYE._\r\n\r\n              \u201cThe wild Albanian kirtled to his knee,\r\n                 With shawl-girt head, and ornamented gun,\r\n               And gold-embroider\u2019d garments, fair to see;\r\n                 The crimson-scarfed man of Macedon.\u201d\r\n                             \u2014LORD BYRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Moreot, Katusthius Ziani, travelled wearily, and in fear of its\r\nrobber-inhabitants, through the pashalik of Yannina; yet he had no cause\r\nfor dread. Did he arrive, tired and hungry, in a solitary village,\u2014did\r\nhe find himself in the uninhabited wilds suddenly surrounded by a band\r\nof klephts,\u2014or in the larger towns did he shrink at finding himself,\r\nsole of his race, among the savage mountaineers and despotic Turk,\u2014as\r\nsoon as he announced himself the Pobratimo[1] of Dmitri of the Evil Eye,\r\nevery hand was held out, every voice spoke welcome.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  In Greece, especially in Illyria and Epirus, it is no uncommon thing\r\n  for persons of the same sex to swear friendship. The Church contains a\r\n  ritual to consecrate this vow. Two men thus united are called\r\n  _pobratimi_, the women _posestrime_.\r\n\r\nThe Albanian, Dmitri, was a native of the village of Korvo. Among the\r\nsavage mountains of the district between Yannina and Terpellen\u00e8, the\r\ndeep broad stream of Argyro-Castro flows; bastioned to the west by\r\nabrupt wood-covered precipices, shadowed to the east by elevated\r\nmountains. The highest among these is Mount Trebucci; and in a romantic\r\nfolding of that hill, distinct with minarets, crowned by a dome rising\r\nfrom out a group of pyramidal cypresses, is the picturesque village of\r\nKorvo. Sheep and goats form the apparent treasure of its inhabitants;\r\ntheir guns and yataghans, their warlike habits, and, with them, the\r\nnoble profession of robbery, are sources of still greater wealth. Among\r\na race renowned for dauntless courage and sanguinary enterprise, Dmitri\r\nwas distinguished.\r\n\r\nIt was said that in his youth this klepht was remarkable for a gentler\r\ndisposition and more refined taste than is usual with his countrymen. He\r\nhad been a wanderer, and had learned European arts, of which he was not\r\na little proud. He could read and write Greek, and a book was often\r\nstowed beside his pistols in his girdle. He had spent several years in\r\nScio, the most civilised of the Greek islands, and had married a Sciote\r\ngirl. The Albanians are characterized as despisers of women; but Dmitri,\r\nin becoming the husband of Helena, enlisted under a more chivalrous\r\nrule, and became the proselyte of a better creed. Often he returned to\r\nhis native hills, and fought under the banner of the renowned Ali, and\r\nthen came back to his island home. The love of the tamed barbarian was\r\nconcentrated, burning, and something beyond this: it was a portion of\r\nhis living, beating heart,\u2014the nobler part of himself,\u2014the diviner mould\r\nin which his rugged nature had been recast.\r\n\r\nOn his return from one of his Albanian expeditions he found his home\r\nravaged by the Mainotes. Helena\u2014they pointed to her tomb, nor dared tell\r\nhim how she died; his only child, his lovely infant daughter, was\r\nstolen; his treasure-house of love and happiness was rifled, its\r\ngold-excelling wealth changed to blank desolation. Dmitri spent three\r\nyears in endeavours to recover his lost offspring. He was exposed to a\r\nthousand dangers, underwent incredible hardships. He dared the wild\r\nbeast in his lair, the Mainote in his port of refuge; he attacked, and\r\nwas attacked by them. He wore the badge of his daring in a deep gash\r\nacross his eyebrow and cheek. On this occasion he had died, but that\r\nKatusthius, seeing a scuffle on shore and a man left for dead,\r\ndisembarked from a Moreot sacovela, carried him away, tended and cured\r\nhim. They exchanged vows of friendship, and for some time the Albanian\r\nshared his brother\u2019s toils; but they were too pacific to suit his taste,\r\nand he returned to Korvo.\r\n\r\nWho in the mutilated savage could recognise the handsomest amongst the\r\nArnaoots? His habits kept pace with his change of physiognomy: he grew\r\nferocious and hardhearted; he only smiled when engaged in dangerous\r\nenterprise. He had arrived at that worst state of ruffian feeling, the\r\ntaking delight in blood. He grew old in these occupations; his mind\r\nbecame reckless, his countenance more dark; men trembled before his\r\nglance, women and children exclaimed in terror, \u201cThe Evil Eye!\u201d The\r\nopinion became prevalent; he shared it himself; he gloried in the dread\r\nprivilege; and when his victim shivered and withered beneath the mortal\r\ninfluence, the fiendish laugh with which he hailed this demonstration of\r\nhis power struck with worse dismay the failing heart of the fascinated\r\nperson. But Dmitri could command the arrows of his sight; and his\r\ncomrades respected him the more for his supernatural attribute since\r\nthey did not fear the exercise of it on themselves.\r\n\r\nDmitri had just returned from an expedition beyond Prevesa. He and his\r\ncomrades were laden with spoil. They killed and roasted a goat whole for\r\ntheir repast; they drank dry several wine skins; then, round the fire in\r\nthe court, they abandoned themselves to the delights of the kerchief\r\ndance, roaring out the chorus as they dropped upon and then rebounded\r\nfrom their knees, and whirled round and round with an activity all their\r\nown. The heart of Dmitri was heavy; he refused to dance, and sat apart,\r\nat first joining in the song with his voice and lute, till the air\r\nchanged to one that reminded him of better days. His voice died away,\r\nhis instrument dropped from his hands, and his head sank upon his\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of stranger footsteps he started up; in the form before him\r\nhe surely recognised a friend\u2014he was not mistaken. With a joyful\r\nexclamation he welcomed Katusthius Ziani, clasping his hand and kissing\r\nhim on the cheek. The traveller was weary, so they retired to Dmitri\u2019s\r\nown home,\u2014a neatly plastered, white-washed cottage, whose earthen floor\r\nwas perfectly dry and clean, and the walls hung with arms\u2014some richly\r\nornamented\u2014and other trophies of his klephtic triumphs. A fire was\r\nkindled by his aged female attendant; the friends reposed on mats of\r\nwhite rushes while she prepared the pilaf and seethed flesh of kid. She\r\nplaced a bright tin-tray on a block of wood before them, and heaped upon\r\nit cakes of Indian corn, goat\u2019s-milk cheese, eggs, and olives; a jar of\r\nwater from their purest spring, and skin of wine, served to refresh and\r\ncheer the thirsty traveller.\r\n\r\nAfter supper the guest spoke of the object of his visit.\r\n\r\n\u201cI come to my pobratimo,\u201d he said, \u201cto claim the performance of his vow.\r\nWhen I rescued you from the savage Kakovougnis of Boularias, you pledged\r\nto me your gratitude and faith; do you disclaim the debt?\u201d\r\n\r\nDmitri\u2019s brow darkened. \u201cMy brother,\u201d he cried, \u201cneed not remind me of\r\nwhat I owe. Command my life; in what can the mountain klepht aid the son\r\nof the wealthy Ziani!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe son of Ziani is a beggar,\u201d rejoined Katusthius, \u201cand must perish if\r\nhis brother deny his assistance.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Moreot then told his tale. He had been brought up as the only son of\r\na rich merchant of Corinth. He had often sailed as caravokeiri[2] of his\r\nfather\u2019s vessels to Stamboul, and even to Calabria. Some years before he\r\nhad been boarded and taken by a Barbary corsair. His life since then had\r\nbeen adventurous, he said; in truth, it had been a guilty one;\u2014he had\r\nbecome a renegade,\u2014and won regard from his new allies, not by his\r\nsuperior courage, for he was cowardly, but by the frauds that make men\r\nwealthy. In the midst of this career some superstition had influenced\r\nhim, and he had returned to his ancient religion. He escaped from\r\nAfrica, wandered through Syria, crossed to Europe, found occupation in\r\nConstantinople; and thus years passed. At last, as he was on the point\r\nof marriage with a Fanariote beauty, he fell again into poverty, and he\r\nreturned to Corinth to see if his father\u2019s fortunes had prospered during\r\nhis long wanderings. He found that while these had improved to a wonder,\r\nthey were lost to him for ever. His father, during his protracted\r\nabsence, acknowledged another son as his; and, dying a year before, had\r\nleft all to him. Katusthius found this unknown kinsman, with his wife\r\nand child, in possession of his expected inheritance. Cyril divided with\r\nhim, it is true, their parent\u2019s property, but Katusthius grasped at all,\r\nand resolved to obtain it. He brooded over a thousand schemes of murder\r\nand revenge; yet the blood of a brother was sacred to him, and Cyril,\r\nbeloved and respected at Corinth, could only be attacked with\r\nconsiderable risk. Then his child was a fresh obstacle. As the best plan\r\nthat presented itself, he hastily embarked for Butrinto, and came to\r\nclaim the advice and assistance of the Arnaoot whose life he had saved,\r\nwhose pobratimo he was. Not thus barely did he tell his tale, but\r\nglossed it over; so that had Dmitri needed the incitement of justice,\r\nwhich was not at all a desideratum with him, he would have been\r\nsatisfied that Cyril was a base interloper, and that the whole\r\ntransaction was one of imposture and villainy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Master of a merchant ship.\r\n\r\nAll night these men discussed a variety of projects, whose aim was, that\r\nthe deceased Ziani\u2019s wealth should pass undivided into his elder son\u2019s\r\nhands. At morning\u2019s dawn Katusthius departed, and two days afterwards\r\nDmitri quitted his mountain-home. His first care had been to purchase a\r\nhorse, long coveted by him on account of its beauty and fleetness; he\r\nprovided cartridges and replenished his powder-horn. His accoutrements\r\nwere rich, his dress gay; his arms glittered in the sun. His long hair\r\nfell straight from under the shawl twisted round his cap, even to his\r\nwaist; a shaggy white capote hung from his shoulder; his face wrinkled\r\nand puckered by exposure to the seasons; his brow furrowed with care;\r\nhis mustachios long and jet-black; his scarred face; his wild, savage\r\neyes;\u2014his whole appearance, not deficient in barbaric grace, but stamped\r\nchiefly with ferocity and bandit pride, inspired, and we need not\r\nwonder, the superstitious Greek with a belief that a supernatural spirit\r\nof evil dwelt in his aspect, blasting and destroying. Now prepared for\r\nhis journey, he departed from Korvo, crossing the woods of Acarnania, on\r\nhis way to Morea.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\u201cWherefore does Zella tremble, and press her boy to her bosom, as if\r\nfearful of evil?\u201d Thus asked Cyril Ziani, returning from the city of\r\nCorinth to his own rural abode. It was a home of beauty. The abruptly\r\nbroken hills covered with olives, or brighter plantations of\r\norange-trees, overlooked the blue waves of the Gulf of Egina. A myrtle\r\nunderwood spread sweet scent around, and dipped its dark shining leaves\r\ninto the sea itself. The low-roofed house was shaded by two enormous\r\nfig-trees, while vineyards and corn-land stretched along the gentle\r\nupland to the north. When Zella saw her husband she smiled, though her\r\ncheek was still pale and her lips quivering. \u201cNow you are near to guard\r\nus,\u201d she said, \u201cI dismiss fear; but danger threatens our Constans, and I\r\nshudder to remember that an Evil Eye has been upon him.\u201d\r\n\r\nCyril caught up his child. \u201cBy my head!\u201d he cried, \u201cthou speakest of an\r\nill thing. The Franks call this superstition; but let us beware. His\r\ncheek is still rosy; his tresses flowing gold. Speak, Constans; hail thy\r\nfather, my brave fellow!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was but a short-lived fear; no ill ensued, and they soon forgot an\r\nincident which had causelessly made their hearts to quail. A week\r\nafterwards Cyril returned, as he was wont, from shipping a cargo of\r\ncurrants, to his retreat on the coast. It was a beautiful summer\r\nevening: the creaking water-wheel, which produced the irrigation of the\r\nland, chimed in with the last song of the noisy cicala; the rippling\r\nwaves spent themselves almost silently among the shingles. This was his\r\nhome; but where its lovely flower? Zella did not come forth to welcome\r\nhim. A domestic pointed to a chapel on a neighbouring acclivity, and\r\nthere he found her; his child (nearly three years of age) was in his\r\nnurse\u2019s arms; his wife was praying fervently, while the tears streamed\r\ndown her cheeks. Cyril demanded anxiously the meaning of this scene; but\r\nthe nurse sobbed; Zella continued to pray and weep; and the boy, from\r\nsympathy, began to cry. This was too much for man to endure. Cyril left\r\nthe chapel; he leant against a walnut-tree. His first exclamation was a\r\ncustomary Greek one, \u201cWelcome this misfortune, so that it come single!\u201d\r\nBut what was the ill that had occurred? Unapparent was it yet; but the\r\nspirit of evil is most fatal when unseen. He was happy,\u2014a lovely wife, a\r\nblooming child, a peaceful home, competence, and the prospect of wealth;\r\nthese blessings were his: yet how often does Fortune use such as her\r\ndecoys? He was a slave in an enslaved land, a mortal subject to the high\r\ndestinies, and ten thousand were the envenomed darts which might be\r\nhurled at his devoted head. Now, timid and trembling, Zella came from\r\nthe chapel: her explanation did not calm his fears. Again the Evil Eye\r\nhad been on his child, and deep malignity lurked surely under this\r\nsecond visitation. The same man, an Arnaoot, with glittering arms, gay\r\nattire, mounted on a black steed, came from the neighbouring ilex grove,\r\nand, riding furiously up to the door, suddenly checked and reined in his\r\nhorse at the very threshold. The child ran towards him: the Arnaoot bent\r\nhis sinister eyes upon him:\u2014\u201cLovely art thou, bright infant,\u201d he cried;\r\n\u201cthy blue eyes are beaming, thy golden tresses fair to see; but thou art\r\na vision fleeting as beautiful;\u2014look at me!\u201d The innocent looked up,\r\nuttered a shriek, and fell gasping on the ground. The women rushed\r\nforward to seize him; the Albanian put spurs to his horse, and,\r\ngalloping swiftly across the little plain, up the wooded hill-side, he\r\nwas soon lost to sight. Zella and the nurse bore the child to the\r\nchapel; they sprinkled him with holy water, and, as he revived, besought\r\nthe Panagia with earnest prayers to save him from the menaced ill.\r\n\r\nSeveral months elapsed; little Constans grew in intelligence and beauty;\r\nno blight had visited the flower of love, and its parents dismissed\r\nfear. Sometimes Cyril indulged in a joke at the expense of the Evil Eye;\r\nbut Zella thought it unlucky to laugh, and crossed herself whenever the\r\nevent was alluded to. At this time Katusthius visited their abode\u2014\u201cHe\r\nwas on his way,\u201d he said, \u201cto Stamboul, and he came to know whether he\r\ncould serve his brother in any of his transactions in the capital.\u201d\r\nCyril and Zella received him with cordial affection: they rejoiced to\r\nperceive that fraternal love was beginning to warm his heart. He seemed\r\nfull of ambition and hope: the brothers discussed his prospects, the\r\npolitics of Europe, and the intrigues of the Fanar: the petty affairs of\r\nCorinth even were made subjects of discourse; and the probability that\r\nin a short time, young as he was, Cyril would be named Codja-Bashee of\r\nthe province. On the morrow, Katusthius prepared to depart. \u201cOne favour\r\ndoes the voluntary exile ask\u2014will my brother and sister accompany me\r\nsome hours on my way to Napoli, whence I embark?\u201d\r\n\r\nZella was unwilling to quit her home, even for a short interval; but she\r\nsuffered herself to be persuaded, and they proceeded altogether for\r\nseveral miles towards the capital of the Morea. At noontide they made a\r\nrepast under the shadow of a grove of oaks, and then separated.\r\nReturning homeward, the wedded pair congratulated themselves on their\r\ntranquil life and peaceful happiness, contrasted with the wanderer\u2019s\r\nlonely and homeless pleasures. These feelings increased in intensity as\r\nthey drew nearer their dwelling, and anticipated the lisped welcome of\r\ntheir idolized child. From an eminence they looked upon the fertile vale\r\nwhich was their home: it was situated on the southern side of the\r\nisthmus, and looked upon the Gulf of Egina\u2014all was verdant, tranquil,\r\nand beautiful. They descended into the plain; there a singular\r\nappearance attracted their attention. A plough with its yoke of oxen had\r\nbeen deserted midway in the furrow; the animals had dragged it to the\r\nside of the field, and endeavoured to repose as well as their\r\nconjunction permitted. The sun already touched its western bourne, and\r\nthe summits of the trees were gilded by its parting beams. All was\r\nsilent; even the eternal water-wheel was still; no menials appeared at\r\ntheir usual rustic labours. From the house the voice of wailing was too\r\nplainly heard.\u2014\u201cMy child!\u201d Zella exclaimed. Cyril began to reassure her;\r\nbut another lament arose, and he hurried on. She dismounted, and would\r\nhave followed him, but sank on the road-side. Her husband returned.\r\n\u201cCourage, my beloved,\u201d he cried; \u201cI will not repose night nor day until\r\nConstans is restored to us\u2014trust to me\u2014farewell!\u201d With these words he\r\nrode swiftly on. Her worst fears were thus confirmed; her maternal\r\nheart, lately so joyous, became the abode of despair, while the nurse\u2019s\r\nnarration of the sad occurrence tended but to add worse fear to fear.\r\nThus it was: the same stranger of the Evil Eye had appeared, not as\r\nbefore, bearing down on them with eagle speed, but as if from a long\r\njourney; his horse lame and with drooping head; the Arnaoot himself\r\ncovered with dust, apparently scarcely able to keep his seat. \u201cBy the\r\nlife of your child,\u201d he said, \u201cgive a cup of water to one who faints\r\nwith thirst.\u201d The nurse, with Constans in her arms, got a bowl of the\r\ndesired liquid, and presented it. Ere the parched lips of the stranger\r\ntouched the wave, the vessel fell from his hands. The woman started\r\nback, while he, at the same moment darting forward, tore with strong arm\r\nthe child from her embrace. Already both were gone\u2014with arrowy speed\r\nthey traversed the plain, while her shrieks, and cries for assistance,\r\ncalled together all the domestics. They followed on the track of the\r\nravisher, and none had yet returned. Now as night closed in, one by one\r\nthey came back: they had nothing to relate; they had scoured the woods,\r\ncrossed the hills\u2014they could not even discover the route which the\r\nAlbanian had taken.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Cyril returned, jaded, haggard, miserable; he had\r\nobtained no tidings of his son. On the morrow he again departed on his\r\nquest, nor came back for several days. Zella passed her time wearily\u2014now\r\nsitting in hopeless despondency, now climbing the near hill to see\r\nwhether she could perceive the approach of her husband. She was not\r\nallowed to remain long thus tranquil; the trembling domestics, left in\r\nguard, warned her that the savage forms of several Arnaoots had been\r\nseen prowling about: she herself saw a tall figure, clad in a shaggy\r\nwhite capote, steal round the promontory, and, on seeing her, shrink\r\nback: once at night the snorting and trampling of a horse roused her,\r\nnot from slumber, but from her sense of security. Wretched as the bereft\r\nmother was, she felt personally almost reckless of danger; but she was\r\nnot her own, she belonged to one beyond expression dear; and duty, as\r\nwell as affection for him, enjoined self-preservation. Cyril, again\r\nreturned: he was gloomier, sadder than before; but there was more\r\nresolution on his brow, more energy in his motions; he had obtained a\r\nclue, yet it might only lead him to the depths of despair.\r\n\r\nHe discovered that Katusthius had not embarked at Napoli. He had joined\r\na band of Arnaoots lurking about Vasilico, and had proceeded to Patras\r\nwith the Protoklepht; thence they put off together in a monoxylon for\r\nthe northern shores of the Gulf of Lepanto: nor were they alone; they\r\nbore a child with them wrapt in a heavy torpid sleep. Poor Cyril\u2019s blood\r\nran cold when he though of the spells and witchcraft which had probably\r\nbeen put in practice on his boy. He would have followed close upon the\r\nrobbers, but for the report that reached him that the remainder of the\r\nAlbanians had proceeded southward towards Corinth. He could not enter\r\nupon a long wandering search among the pathless wilds of Epirus, leaving\r\nZella exposed to the attacks of these bandits. He returned to consult\r\nwith her, to devise some plan of action which would at once ensure her\r\nsafety and promise success to his endeavours.\r\n\r\nAfter some hesitation and discussion, it was decided that he should\r\nfirst conduct her to her native home, consult with her father as to his\r\npresent enterprise, and be guided by his warlike experience before he\r\nrushed into the very focus of danger. The seizure of his child might\r\nonly be a lure, and it were not well for him, sole protector of that\r\nchild and its mother, to rush unadvisedly into the toils.\r\n\r\nZella, strange to say, for her blue eyes and brilliant complexion belied\r\nher birth, was the daughter of a Mainote: yet dreaded and abhorred by\r\nthe rest of the world as are the inhabitants of Cape T\u00e6narus, they are\r\ncelebrated for their domestic virtues and the strength of their private\r\nattachments. Zella loved her father, and the memory of her rugged rocky\r\nhome, from which she had been torn in an adverse hour. Near neighbours\r\nof the Mainotes, dwelling in the ruder and wildest portion of Maina, are\r\nthe Kakovougnis, a dark suspicious race, of squat and stunted form,\r\nstrongly contrasted with the tranquil cast of countenance characteristic\r\nof the Mainote. The two tribes are embroiled in perpetual quarrels; the\r\nnarrow sea-girt abode which they share affords at once a secure place of\r\nrefuge from the foreign enemy and all the facilities of internal\r\nmountain warfare. Cyril had once, during a coasting voyage, been driven\r\nby stress of weather into the little bay on whose shores is placed the\r\nsmall town of Kardamyla. The crew at first dreaded to be captured by the\r\npirates; but they were reassured on finding them fully occupied by their\r\ndomestic dissensions. A band of Kakovougnis were besieging the\r\ncastellated rock overlooking Kardamyla, blockading the fortress in which\r\nthe Mainote Capitano and his family had taken refuge. Two days passed\r\nthus, while furious contrary winds detained Cyril in the bay. On the\r\nthird evening the western gale subsided, and a land-breeze promised to\r\nemancipate them from their perilous condition; when in the night, as\r\nthey were about to put off in a boat from shore, they were hailed by a\r\nparty of Mainotes, and one, an old man of commanding figure, demanded a\r\nparley. He was the Capitano of Kardamyla, the chief of the fortress, now\r\nattacked by his implacable enemies: he saw no escape\u2014he must fall\u2014and\r\nhis chief desire was to save his treasure and his family from the hands\r\nof his enemies. Cyril consented to receive them on board: the latter\r\nconsisted of an old mother, a paramana, and a young and beautiful girl,\r\nhis daughter. Cyril conducted them in safety to Napoli. Soon after the\r\nCapitano\u2019s mother and paramana returned to their native town, while,\r\nwith her father\u2019s consent, fair Zella became the wife of her preserver.\r\nThe fortunes of the Mainote had prospered since then, and he stood first\r\nin rank, the chief of a large tribe, the Capitano of Kardamyla.\r\n\r\nThither then the hapless parents repaired; they embarked on board a\r\nsmall sacovela, which dropt down the Gulf of Egina, weathered the\r\nislands of Skyllo and Cerigo, and the extreme point of T\u00e6narus: favoured\r\nby prosperous gales, they made the desired port, and arrived at the\r\nhospitable mansion of old Camaraz. He heard their tale with indignation;\r\nswore by his beard to dip his poniard in the best blood of Katusthius,\r\nand insisted upon accompanying his son-in-law on his expedition to\r\nAlbania. No time was lost\u2014the grey-headed mariner, still full of energy,\r\nhastened every preparation. Cyril and Zella parted; a thousand fears, a\r\nthousand hours of misery rose between the pair, late sharers in perfect\r\nhappiness. The boisterous sea and distant lands were the smallest of the\r\nobstacles that divided them; they would not fear the worst; yet hope, a\r\nsickly plant, faded in their hearts as they tore themselves asunder\r\nafter a last embrace.\r\n\r\nZella returned from the fertile district of Corinth to her barren native\r\nrocks. She felt all joy expire as she viewed from the rugged shore the\r\nlessening sails of the sacovela. Days and weeks passed, and still she\r\nremained in solitary and sad expectation: she never joined in the dance,\r\nnor made one in the assemblies of her countrywomen, who met together at\r\nevening-tide to sing, tell stories, and wile away the time in dance and\r\ngaiety. She secluded herself in the most lonely part of her father\u2019s\r\nhouse, and gazed unceasingly from the lattice upon the sea beneath, or\r\nwandered on the rocky beach; and when tempest darkened the sky, and each\r\nprecipitous promontory grew purple under the shadows of the wide-winged\r\nclouds, when the roar of the surges was on the shore, and the white\r\ncrests of the waves, seen afar upon the ocean-plain, showed like flocks\r\nof new-shorn sheep scattered along wide-extended downs, she felt neither\r\ngale nor inclement cold, nor returned home till recalled by her\r\nattendants. In obedience to them she sought the shelter of her abode,\r\nnot to remain long; for the wild winds spoke to her, and the stormy\r\nocean reproached her tranquillity. Unable to control the impulse, she\r\nwould rush from her habitation on the cliff, nor remember, till she\r\nreached the shore, that her papooshes were left midway on the\r\nmountain-path, and that her forgotten veil and disordered dress were\r\nunmeet for such a scene. Often the unnumbered hours sped on, while this\r\norphaned child of happiness leant on a cold dark rock; the low-browed\r\ncrags beetled over her, the surges broke at her feet, her fair limbs\r\nwere stained by spray, her tresses dishevelled by the gale. Hopelessly\r\nshe wept until a sail appeared on the horizon; and then she dried her\r\nfast-flowing tears, fixing her large eyes upon the nearing hull or\r\nfading topsail. Meanwhile the storm tossed the clouds into a thousand\r\ngigantic shapes, and the tumultuous sea grew blacker and more wild; her\r\nnatural gloom was heightened by superstitious horror; the Morai, the old\r\nFates of her native Grecian soil, howled in the breezes; apparitions,\r\nwhich told of her child pining under the influence of the Evil Eye, and\r\nof her husband, the prey of some Thracian witchcraft, such as still is\r\npractised in the dread neighbourhood of Larissa, haunted her broken\r\nslumbers, and stalked like dire shadows across her waking thoughts. Her\r\nbloom was gone, her eyes lost their lustre, her limbs their round full\r\nbeauty; her strength failed her, as she tottered to the accustomed spot\r\nto watch\u2014vainly, yet for ever to watch.\r\n\r\nWhat is there so fearful as the expectation of evil tidings delayed?\r\nSometimes in the midst of tears, or worse, amidst the convulsive\r\ngaspings of despair, we reproach ourselves for influencing the eternal\r\nfates by our gloomy anticipations: then, if a smile wreathe the\r\nmourner\u2019s quivering lip, it is arrested by a throb of agony. Alas! are\r\nnot the dark tresses of the young painted grey, the full cheek of beauty\r\ndelved with sad lines by the spirits of such hours? Misery is a more\r\nwelcome visitant when she comes in her darkest guise and wraps us in\r\nperpetual black, for then the heart no longer sickens with disappointed\r\nhope.\r\n\r\nCyril and old Camaraz had found great difficulty in doubling the many\r\ncapes of the Morea as they made a coasting expedition from Kardamyla to\r\nthe Gulf of Arta, north of Cefalonia and St. Mauro. During their voyage\r\nthey had time to arrange their plans. As a number of Moreots travelling\r\ntogether might attract too much attention, they resolved to land their\r\ncomrades at different points, and travel separately into the interior of\r\nAlbania: Yannina was their first place of rendezvous. Cyril and his\r\nfather-in-law disembarked in one of the most secluded of the many creeks\r\nwhich diversify the winding and precipitous shores of the gulf. Six\r\nothers, chosen from the crew, would, by other routes, join them at the\r\ncapital. They did not fear for themselves; alone, but well armed, and\r\nsecure in the courage of despair, they penetrated the fastnesses of\r\nEpirus. No success cheered them: they arrived at Yannina without having\r\nmade the slightest discovery. They were joined by their comrades, whom\r\nthey directed to remain three days in the town, and then separately to\r\nproceed to Terpellen\u00e8, whither they immediately directed their steps. At\r\nthe first village on their way thither, at \u201cmonastic Zitza,\u201d they\r\nobtained some information, not to direct, but to encourage their\r\nendeavours. They sought refreshment and hospitality in the monastery,\r\nwhich is situated on a green eminence, crowned by a grove of oak trees,\r\nimmediately behind the village. Perhaps there is not in the world a more\r\nbeautiful or more romantic spot, sheltered itself by clustering trees,\r\nlooking out on one widespread landscape of hill and dale, enriched by\r\nvineyards, dotted with frequent flocks; while the Calamas in the depth\r\nof the vale gives life to the scene, and the far blue mountains of\r\nZoumerkas, Sagori, Sulli, and Acroceraunia, to the east, west, north,\r\nand south, close in the various prospects. Cyril half envied the\r\nCaloyers their inert tranquillity. They received the travellers gladly,\r\nand were cordial though simple in their manners. When questioned\r\nconcerning the object of their journey, they warmly sympathized with the\r\nfather\u2019s anxiety, and eagerly told all they knew. Two weeks before, an\r\nArnaoot, well known to them as Dmitri of the Evil Eye, a famous klepht\r\nof Korvo, and a Moreot, arrived, bringing with them a child,\u2014a bold,\r\nspirited, beautiful boy, who, with firmness beyond his years, claimed\r\nthe protection of the Caloyers, and accused his companions of having\r\ncarried him off by force from his parents.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy my head!\u201d cried the Albanian, \u201ca brave Palikar: he keeps his word,\r\nbrother; he swore by the Panagia, in spite of our threats of throwing\r\nhim down a precipice, food for the vulture, to accuse us to the first\r\ngood men he saw: he neither pines under the Evil Eye, nor quails beneath\r\nour menaces.\u201d\r\n\r\nKatusthius frowned at these praises, and it became evident during their\r\nstay at the monastery that the Albanian and the Moreot quarrelled as to\r\nthe disposal of the child. The rugged mountaineer threw off all his\r\nsternness as he gazed upon the boy. When little Constans slept, he hung\r\nover him, fanning away with woman\u2019s care the flies and gnats. When he\r\nspoke, he answered with expressions of fondness, winning him with gifts,\r\nteaching him, all child as he was, a mimicry of warlike exercises. When\r\nthe boy knelt and besought the Panagia to restore him to his parents,\r\nhis voice quivering, and tears running down his cheeks, the eyes of\r\nDmitri overflowed; he cast his cloak over his face; his heart whispered\r\nto him: \u201cThus, perhaps, my child prayed. Heaven was deaf. Alas! where is\r\nshe now?\u201d\r\n\r\nEncouraged by such signs of compassion, which children are quick to\r\nperceive, Constans twined his arms round his neck, telling him that he\r\nloved him, and that he would fight for him when a man, if he would take\r\nhim back to Corinth. At such words Dmitri would rush forth, seek\r\nKatusthius, remonstrate with him, till the unrelenting man checked him\r\nby reminding him of his vow. Still he swore that no hair of the child\u2019s\r\nhead should be injured; while the uncle, unvisited by compunction,\r\nmeditated his destruction. The quarrels which thence arose were\r\nfrequent, and violent, till Katusthius, weary of opposition, had\r\nrecourse to craft to obtain his purpose. One night he secretly left the\r\nmonastery, bearing the child with him. When Dmitri heard of his evasion,\r\nit was a fearful thing to the good Caloyers only to look upon him; they\r\ninstinctively clutched hold of every bit of iron on which they could lay\r\ntheir hands, so to avert the Evil Eye which glared with native and\r\nuntamed fierceness. In their panic a whole score of them had rushed to\r\nthe iron-plated door which led out of their abode: with the strength of\r\na lion, Dmitri tore them away, threw back the portal, and, with the\r\nswiftness of a torrent fed by the thawing of the snows in spring, he\r\ndashed down the steep hill\u2014the flight of an eagle not more rapid; the\r\ncourse of a wild beast not more resolved.\r\n\r\nSuch was the clue afforded to Cyril. It were too long to follow him in\r\nhis subsequent search; he, with old Camaraz, wandered through the vale\r\nof Argyro-Castro, and climbed Mount Trebucci to Korvo. Dmitri had\r\nreturned; he had gathered together a score of faithful comrades, and\r\nsallied forth again; various were the reports of his destination, and\r\nthe enterprise which he meditated. One of these led our adventurers to\r\nTerpellen\u00e8, and hence back towards Yannina; and now chance again\r\nfavoured them. They rested one night in the habitation of a priest at\r\nthe little village of Mosme, about three leagues to the north of Zitza;\r\nand here they found an Arnaoot who had been disabled by a fall from his\r\nhorse; this man was to have made one of Dmitri\u2019s band: they learned from\r\nhim that the Arnaoot had tracked Katusthius, following him close, and\r\nforcing him to take refuge in the monastery of the Prophet Elias, which\r\nstands on an elevated peak of the mountains of Sagori, eight leagues\r\nfrom Yannina. Dmitri had followed him, and demanded the child. The\r\nCaloyers refused to give it up, and the klepht, roused to mad\r\nindignation, was now besieging and battering the monastery, to obtain by\r\nforce this object of his newly-awakened affections.\r\n\r\nAt Yannina, Camaraz and Cyril collected their comrades, and departed to\r\njoin their unconscious ally. He, more impetuous than a mountain stream\r\nor ocean\u2019s fiercest waves, struck terror into the hearts of the recluses\r\nby his ceaseless and dauntless attacks. To encourage them to further\r\nresistance, Katusthius, leaving the child behind in the monastery,\r\ndeparted for the nearest town of Sagori, to entreat its Belouk-Bashee to\r\ncome to their aid. The Sagorians are a mild, amiable, social people;\r\nthey are gay, frank, clever; their bravery is universally acknowledged,\r\neven by the more uncivilised mountaineers of Zoumerkas; yet robbery,\r\nmurder, and other acts of violence are unknown among them. These good\r\npeople were not a little indignant when they heard that a band of\r\nArnaoots was besieging and battering the sacred retreat of their\r\nfavourite Caloyers. They assembled in a gallant troop, and, taking\r\nKatusthius with them, hastened to drive the insolent klephts back to\r\ntheir ruder fastnesses. They came too late. At midnight, while the monks\r\nprayed fervently to be delivered from their enemies, Dmitri and his\r\nfollowers tore down their iron-plated door and entered the holy\r\nprecincts. The Protoklepht strode up to the gates of the sanctuary, and,\r\nplacing his hands upon it, swore that he came to save, not to destroy.\r\nConstans saw him. With a cry of delight he disengaged himself from the\r\nCaloyer who held him, and rushed into his arms: this was sufficient\r\ntriumph. With assurance of sincere regret for having disturbed them, the\r\nklepht quitted the chapel with his followers, taking his prize with him.\r\n\r\nKatusthius returned some hours after, and so well did the traitor plead\r\nhis cause with the kind Sagorians, bewailing the fate of his little\r\nnephew among those evil men, that they offered to follow, and, superior\r\nas their numbers were, to rescue the boy from their destructive hands.\r\nKatusthius, delighted with the proposition, urged their immediate\r\ndeparture. At dawn they began to climb the mountain summits, already\r\ntrodden by the Zoumerkians.\r\n\r\nDelighted with repossessing his little favourite, Dmitri placed him\r\nbefore him on his horse, and, followed by his comrades, made his way\r\nover the mountains, clothed with old Dodona\u2019s oaks, or, in higher\r\nsummits, by dark gigantic pines. They proceeded for some hours, and at\r\nlength dismounted to repose. The spot they chose was the depth of a dark\r\nravine, whose gloom was increased by the broad shadows of dark ilexes;\r\nan entangled underwood, and a sprinkling of craggy isolated rocks, made\r\nit difficult for the horses to keep their footing. They dismounted, and\r\nsat by the little stream. Their simple fare was spread, and Dmitri\r\nenticed the boy to eat by a thousand caresses. Suddenly one of his men,\r\nset as a guard, brought intelligence that a troop of Sagorians, with\r\nKatusthius as their guide, was advancing from the monastery of St.\r\nElias; while another man gave the alarm of the approach of six or eight\r\nwell-armed Moreots, who were advancing on the road from Yannina; in a\r\nmoment every sign of encampment had disappeared. The Arnaoots began to\r\nclimb the hills, getting under cover of the rocks, and behind the large\r\ntrunks of the forest trees, keeping concealed till their invaders should\r\nbe in the very midst of them. Soon the Moreots appeared, turning round\r\nthe defile, in a path that only allowed them to proceed two by two; they\r\nwere unaware of danger, and walked carelessly, until a shot that whizzed\r\nover the head of one, striking the bough of a tree, recalled them from\r\ntheir security. The Greeks, accustomed to the same mode of warfare,\r\nbetook themselves also to the safeguards of the rocks, firing from\r\nbehind them, striving with their adversaries which should get to the\r\nmost elevated station; jumping from crag to crag, and dropping down and\r\nfiring as quickly as they could load: one old man alone remained on the\r\npathway. The mariner, Camaraz, had often encountered the enemy on the\r\ndeck of his caick, and would still have rushed foremost at a boarding,\r\nbut this warfare required too much activity. Cyril called on him to\r\nshelter himself beneath a low, broad stone: the Mainote waved his hand.\r\n\u201cFear not for me,\u201d he cried; \u201cI know how to die!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe brave love the brave. Dmitri saw the old man stand, unflinching, a\r\nmark for all the balls, and he started from behind his rocky screen,\r\ncalling on his men to cease. Then addressing his enemy, he cried, \u201cWho\r\nart thou? Wherefore art thou here? If ye come in peace, proceed on your\r\nway. Answer, and fear not!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old man drew himself up, saying, \u201cI am a Mainote, and cannot fear.\r\nAll Hellas trembles before the pirates of Cape Matapan, and I am one of\r\nthese! I do not come in peace! Behold! you have in your arms the cause\r\nof our dissension! I am the grandsire of that child\u2014give him to me!\u201d\r\n\r\nDmitri, had he held a snake which he felt awakening in his bosom, could\r\nnot so suddenly have changed his cheer;\u2014\u201cthe offspring of a Mainote!\u201d\u2014he\r\nrelaxed his grasp;\u2014Constans would have fallen had he not clung to his\r\nneck. Meanwhile each party had descended from their rocky station, and\r\nwere grouped together in the pathway below. Dmitri tore the child from\r\nhis neck\u2014he felt as if he could, with savage delight, dash him down the\r\nprecipice; when, as he paused and trembled from excess of passion,\r\nKatusthius, and the foremost Sagorians, came down upon them.\r\n\r\n\u201cStand!\u201d cried the infuriated Arnaoot. \u201cBehold, Katusthius! behold,\r\nfriend, whom I, driven by the resistless fates, madly and wickedly\r\nforswore! I now perform thy wish\u2014the Mainote child dies! the son of the\r\naccursed race shall be the victim of my just revenge!\u201d\r\n\r\nCyril, in a transport of fear, rushed up the rock; he levelled his\r\nmusket but he feared to sacrifice his child. The old Mainote, less timid\r\nand more desperate, took a steady aim; Dmitri saw the act, and hurled\r\nthe dagger, already raised against the child, at him,\u2014it entered his\r\nside,\u2014while Constans, feeling his late protector\u2019s grasp relax, sprang\r\nfrom it into his father\u2019s arms.\r\n\r\nCamaraz had fallen, yet his wound was slight. He saw the Arnaoots and\r\nSagorians close round him; he saw his own followers made prisoners.\r\nDmitri and Katusthius had both thrown themselves upon Cyril, struggling\r\nto repossess themselves of the screaming boy. The Mainote raised\r\nhimself\u2014he was feeble of limb, but his heart was strong; he threw\r\nhimself before the father and child; he caught the upraised arm of\r\nDmitri. \u201cOn me,\u201d he cried, \u201cfall all thy vengeance! I of the evil race!\r\nfor the child, he is innocent of such parentage! Maina cannot boast him\r\nfor a son!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMan of lies!\u201d commenced the infuriated Arnaoot, \u201cthis falsehood shall\r\nnot stead thee!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay, by the souls of those you have loved, listen!\u201d continued Camaraz,\r\n\u201cand if I make not good my words, may I and my children die! The boy\u2019s\r\nfather is a Corinthian, his mother, a Sciote girl!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cScio!\u201d the very word made the blood recede to Dmitri\u2019s heart.\r\n\u201cVillain!\u201d he cried, dashing aside Katusthius\u2019 arm, which was raised\r\nagainst poor Constans, \u201cI guard this child\u2014dare not to injure him!\r\nSpeak, old man, and fear not, so that thou speakest the truth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFifteen years ago,\u201d said Camaraz, \u201cI hovered with my caick, in search\r\nof prey, on the coast of Scio. A cottage stood on the borders of a\r\nchestnut wood; it was the habitation of the widow of a wealthy\r\nislander\u2014she dwelt in it with her only daughter, married to an Albanian,\r\nthen absent;\u2014the good woman was reported to have a concealed treasure in\r\nher house\u2014the girl herself would be rich spoil\u2014it was an adventure worth\r\nthe risk. We ran our vessel up a shady creek, and, on the going down of\r\nthe moon, landed; stealing under the covert of night towards the lonely\r\nabode of these women.\u201d\r\n\r\nDmitri grasped at his dagger\u2019s hilt\u2014it was no longer there; he half drew\r\na pistol from his girdle\u2014little Constans, again confiding in his former\r\nfriend, stretched out his hands and clung to his arm; the klepht looked\r\non him, half yielded to his desire to embrace him, half feared to be\r\ndeceived; so he turned away, throwing his capote over his face, veiling\r\nhis anguish, controlling his emotions, till all should be told. Camaraz\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt became a worse tragedy than I had contemplated. The girl had a\r\nchild\u2014she feared for its life, and struggled with the men like a tigress\r\ndefending her young. I was in another room seeking for the hidden store,\r\nwhen a piercing shriek rent the air\u2014I never knew what compassion was\r\nbefore\u2014this cry went to my heart; but it was too late, the poor girl had\r\nsunk to the ground, the life-tide oozing from her bosom. I know not why,\r\nbut I turned woman in my regret for the slain beauty. I meant to have\r\ncarried her and her child on board, to see if aught could be done to\r\nsave her, but she died ere we left the shore. I thought she would like\r\nher island grave best, and truly feared that she might turn vampire to\r\nhaunt me, did I carry her away; so we left her corpse for the priests to\r\nbury, and carried off the child, then about two years old. She could say\r\nfew words except her own name\u2014that was Zella, and she is the mother of\r\nthis boy!\u201d\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA succession of arrivals in the bay of Kardamyla had kept poor Zella\r\nwatching for many nights. Her attendant had, in despair of ever seeing\r\nher sleep again, drugged with opium the few cakes she persuaded her to\r\neat, but the poor woman did not calculate on the power of mind over\r\nbody, of love over every enemy, physical or moral, arrayed against it.\r\nZella lay on her couch, her spirit somewhat subdued, but her heart\r\nalive, her eyes unclosed. In the night, led by some unexplained impulse,\r\nshe crawled to her lattice, and saw a little sacovela enter the bay; it\r\nran in swiftly, under favour of the wind, and was lost to her sight\r\nunder a jutting crag. Lightly she trod the marble floor of her chamber;\r\nshe drew a large shawl close round her; she descended the rocky pathway,\r\nand reached, with swift steps, the beach\u2014still the vessel was invisible,\r\nand she was half inclined to think that it was the offspring of her\r\nexcited imagination\u2014yet she lingered. She felt a sickness at her very\r\nheart whenever she attempted to move, and her eyelids weighed down in\r\nspite of herself. The desire of sleep at last became irresistible; she\r\nlay down on the shingles, reposed her head on the cold, hard pillow,\r\nfolded her shawl still closer, and gave herself up to forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nSo profoundly did she slumber under the influence of the opiate, that\r\nfor many hours she was insensible of any change in her situation. By\r\ndegrees only she awoke, by degrees only became aware of the objects\r\naround her; the breeze felt fresh and free\u2014so was it ever on the\r\nwave-beaten coast; the waters rippled near, their dash had been in her\r\nears as she yielded to repose; but this was not her stony couch, that\r\ncanopy, not the dark overhanging cliff. Suddenly she lifted up her\r\nhead\u2014she was on the deck of a small vessel, which was skimming swiftly\r\nover the ocean-waves\u2014a cloak of sables pillowed her head; the shores of\r\nCape Matapan were to her left, and they steered right towards the\r\nnoonday sun. Wonder rather than fear possessed her: with a quick hand\r\nshe drew aside the sail that veiled her from the crew\u2014the dreaded\r\nAlbanian was sitting close at her side, her Constans cradled in his\r\narms; she uttered a cry\u2014Cyril turned at the sound, and in a moment she\r\nwas folded in his embrace.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n\r\n                              _THE DREAM._\r\n\r\n                        \u201cChi dice mal d\u2019amore\r\n                         Dice una falsit\u00e0!\u201d\r\n                                  \u2014ITALIAN SONG.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE time of the occurrence of the little legend about to be narrated,\r\nwas that of the commencement of the reign of Henry IV. of France, whose\r\naccession and conversion, while they brought peace to the kingdom whose\r\nthrone he ascended, were inadequate to heal the deep wounds mutually\r\ninflicted by the inimical parties. Private feuds, and the memory of\r\nmortal injuries, existed between those now apparently united; and often\r\ndid the hands that had clasped each other in seeming friendly greeting,\r\ninvoluntarily, as the grasp was released, clasp the dagger\u2019s hilt, as\r\nfitter spokesman to their passions than the words of courtesy that had\r\njust fallen from their lips. Many of the fiercer Catholics retreated to\r\ntheir distant provinces; and while they concealed in solitude their\r\nrankling discontent, not less keenly did they long for the day when they\r\nmight show it openly.\r\n\r\nIn a large and fortified chateau built on a rugged steep overlooking the\r\nLoire, not far from the town of Nantes, dwelt the last of her race, and\r\nthe heiress of their fortunes, the young and beautiful Countess de\r\nVilleneuve. She had spent the preceding year in complete solitude in her\r\nsecluded abode; and the mourning she wore for a father and two brothers,\r\nthe victims of the civil wars, was a graceful and good reason why she\r\ndid not appear at court, and mingle with its festivities. But the orphan\r\ncountess inherited a high name and broad lands; and it was soon\r\nsignified to her that the king, her guardian, desired that she should\r\nbestow them, together with her hand, upon some noble whose birth and\r\naccomplishments should entitle him to the gift. Constance, in reply,\r\nexpressed her intention of taking vows, and retiring to a convent. The\r\nking earnestly and resolutely forbade this act, believing such an idea\r\nto be the result of sensibility overwrought by sorrow, and relying on\r\nthe hope that, after a time, the genial spirit of youth would break\r\nthrough this cloud.\r\n\r\nA year passed, and still the countess persisted; and at last Henry,\r\nunwilling to exercise compulsion,\u2014desirous, too, of judging for himself\r\nof the motives that led one so beautiful, young, and gifted with\r\nfortune\u2019s favours, to desire to bury herself in a cloister,\u2014announced\r\nhis intention, now that the period of her mourning was expired, of\r\nvisiting her chateau; and if he brought not with him, the monarch said,\r\ninducement sufficient to change her design, he would yield his consent\r\nto its fulfilment.\r\n\r\nMany a sad hour had Constance passed\u2014many a day of tears, and many a\r\nnight of restless misery. She had closed her gates against every\r\nvisitant; and, like the Lady Olivia in \u201cTwelfth Night,\u201d vowed herself to\r\nloneliness and weeping. Mistress of herself, she easily silenced the\r\nentreaties and remonstrances of underlings, and nursed her grief as it\r\nhad been the thing she loved. Yet it was too keen, too bitter, too\r\nburning, to be a favoured guest. In fact, Constance, young, ardent, and\r\nvivacious, battled with it, struggled, and longed to cast it off; but\r\nall that was joyful in itself, or fair in outward show, only served to\r\nrenew it; and she could best support the burden of her sorrow with\r\npatience, when, yielding to it, it oppressed but did not torture her.\r\n\r\nConstance had left the castle to wander in the neighbouring grounds.\r\nLofty and extensive as were the apartments of her abode, she felt pent\r\nup within their walls, beneath their fretted roofs. The spreading\r\nuplands and the antique wood, associated to her with every dear\r\nrecollection of her past life, enticed her to spend hours and days\r\nbeneath their leafy coverts. The motion and change eternally working, as\r\nthe wind stirred among the boughs, or the journeying sun rained its\r\nbeams through them, soothed and called her out of that dull sorrow which\r\nclutched her heart with so unrelenting a pang beneath her castle roof.\r\n\r\nThere was one spot on the verge of the well-wooded park, one nook of\r\nground, whence she could discern the country extended beyond, yet which\r\nwas in itself thick set with tall umbrageous trees\u2014a spot which she had\r\nforsworn, yet whither unconsciously her steps for ever tended, and where\r\nnow again, for the twentieth time that day, she had unaware found\r\nherself. She sat upon a grassy mound, and looked wistfully on the\r\nflowers she had herself planted to adorn the verdurous recess\u2014to her the\r\ntemple of memory and love. She held the letter from the king which was\r\nthe parent to her of so much despair. Dejection sat upon her features,\r\nand her gentle heart asked fate why, so young, unprotected, and\r\nforsaken, she should have to struggle with this new form of\r\nwretchedness.\r\n\r\n\u201cI but ask,\u201d she thought, \u201cto live in my father\u2019s halls\u2014in the spot\r\nfamiliar to my infancy\u2014to water with my frequent tears the graves of\r\nthose I loved; and here in these woods, where such a mad dream of\r\nhappiness was mine, to celebrate for ever the obsequies of Hope!\u201d\r\n\r\nA rustling among the boughs now met her ear\u2014her heart beat quick\u2014all\r\nagain was still.\r\n\r\n\u201cFoolish girl!\u201d she half muttered; \u201cdupe of thine own passionate fancy:\r\nbecause here we met; because seated here I have expected, and sounds\r\nlike these have announced, his dear approach; so now every coney as it\r\nstirs, and every bird as it awakens silence, speaks of him. O\r\nGaspar!\u2014mine once\u2014never again will this beloved spot be made glad by\r\nthee\u2014never more!\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain the bushes were stirred, and footsteps were heard in the brake.\r\nShe rose; her heart beat high; it must be that silly Manon, with her\r\nimpertinent entreaties for her to return. But the steps were firmer and\r\nslower than would be those of her waiting-woman; and now emerging from\r\nthe shade, she too plainly discerned the intruder. Her first impulse was\r\nto fly:\u2014but once again to see him\u2014to hear his voice:\u2014once again before\r\nshe placed eternal vows between them, to stand together, and find the\r\nwide chasm filled which absence had made, could not injure the dead, and\r\nwould soften the fatal sorrow that made her cheek so pale.\r\n\r\nAnd now he was before her, the same beloved one with whom she had\r\nexchanged vows of constancy. He, like her, seemed sad; nor could she\r\nresist the imploring glance that entreated her for one moment to remain.\r\n\r\n\u201cI come, lady,\u201d said the young knight, \u201cwithout a hope to bend your\r\ninflexible will. I come but once again to see you, and to bid you\r\nfarewell before I depart for the Holy Land. I come to beseech you not to\r\nimmure yourself in the dark cloister to avoid one as hateful as\r\nmyself,\u2014one you will never see more. Whether I die or live, France and I\r\nare parted for ever!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat were fearful, were it true,\u201d said Constance; \u201cbut King Henry will\r\nnever so lose his favourite cavalier. The throne you helped to build,\r\nyou still will guard. Nay, as I ever had power over thought of thine, go\r\nnot to Palestine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne word of yours could detain me\u2014one smile\u2014Constance\u201d\u2014and the youthful\r\nlover knelt before her; but her harsher purpose was recalled by the\r\nimage once so dear and familiar, now so strange and so forbidden.\r\n\r\n\u201cLinger no longer here!\u201d she cried. \u201cNo smile, no word of mine will ever\r\nagain be yours. Why are you here\u2014here, where the spirits of the dead\r\nwander, and, claiming these shades as their own, curse the false girl\r\nwho permits their murderer to disturb their sacred repose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen love was young and you were kind,\u201d replied the knight, \u201cyou taught\r\nme to thread the intricacies of these woods\u2014you welcomed me to this dear\r\nspot, where once you vowed to be my own\u2014even beneath these ancient\r\ntrees.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA wicked sin it was,\u201d said Constance, \u201cto unbar my father\u2019s doors to\r\nthe son of his enemy, and dearly is it punished!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young knight gained courage as she spoke; yet he dared not move,\r\nlest she, who, every instant, appeared ready to take flight, should be\r\nstartled from her momentary tranquillity; but he slowly replied:\u2014\u201cThose\r\nwere happy days, Constance, full of terror and deep joy, when evening\r\nbrought me to your feet; and while hate and vengeance were as its\r\natmosphere to yonder frowning castle, this leafy, starlit bower was the\r\nshrine of love.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Happy?_\u2014miserable days!\u201d echoed Constance; \u201cwhen I imagined good could\r\narise from failing in my duty, and that disobedience would be rewarded\r\nof God. Speak not of love, Gaspar!\u2014a sea of blood divides us for ever!\r\nApproach me not! The dead and the beloved stand even now between us:\r\ntheir pale shadows warn me of my fault, and menace me for listening to\r\ntheir murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat am not I!\u201d exclaimed the youth. \u201cBehold, Constance, we are each\r\nthe last of our race. Death has dealt cruelly with us, and we are alone.\r\nIt was not so when first we loved\u2014when parent, kinsman, brother, nay, my\r\nown mother breathed curses on the house of Villeneuve; and in spite of\r\nall I blessed it. I saw thee, my lovely one, and blessed it. The God of\r\npeace planted love in our hearts, and with mystery and secrecy we met\r\nduring many a summer night in the moonlit dells; and when daylight was\r\nabroad, in this sweet recess we fled to avoid its scrutiny, and here,\r\neven here, where now I kneel in supplication, we both knelt and made our\r\nvows. Shall they be broken?\u201d\r\n\r\nConstance wept as her lover recalled the images of happy hours. \u201cNever,\u201d\r\nshe exclaimed, \u201cO never! Thou knowest, or wilt soon know, Gaspar, the\r\nfaith and resolves of one who dare not be yours. Was it for us to talk\r\nof love and happiness, when war, and hate, and blood were raging around?\r\nThe fleeting flowers our young hands strewed were trampled by the deadly\r\nencounter of mortal foes. By your father\u2019s hand mine died; and little\r\nboots it to know whether, as my brother swore, and you deny, your hand\r\ndid or did not deal the blow that destroyed him. You fought among those\r\nby whom he died. Say no more\u2014no other word: it is impiety towards the\r\nunreposing dead to hear you. Go, Gaspar; forget me. Under the chivalrous\r\nand gallant Henry your career may be glorious; and some fair girl will\r\nlisten, as once I did, to your vows, and be made happy by them.\r\nFarewell! May the Virgin bless you! In my cell and cloister-home I will\r\nnot forget the best Christian lesson\u2014to pray for our enemies. Gaspar,\r\nfarewell!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe glided hastily from the bower: with swift steps she threaded the\r\nglade and sought the castle. Once within the seclusion of her own\r\napartment she gave way to the burst of grief that tore her gentle bosom\r\nlike a tempest; for hers was that worst sorrow which taints past joys,\r\nmaking remorse wait upon the memory of bliss, and linking love and\r\nfancied guilt in such fearful society as that of the tyrant when he\r\nbound a living body to a corpse. Suddenly a thought darted into her\r\nmind. At first she rejected it as puerile and superstitious; but it\r\nwould not be driven away. She called hastily for her attendant. \u201cManon,\u201d\r\nshe said, \u201cdidst thou ever sleep on St. Catherine\u2019s couch?\u201d\r\n\r\nManon crossed herself. \u201cHeaven forefend! None ever did, since I was\r\nborn, but two: one fell into the Loire and was drowned; the other only\r\nlooked upon the narrow bed, and returned to her own home without a word.\r\nIt is an awful place; and if the votary have not led a pious and good\r\nlife, woe betide the hour when she rests her head on the holy stone!\u201d\r\n\r\nConstance crossed herself also. \u201cAs for our lives, it is only through\r\nour Lord and the blessed saints that we can any of us hope for\r\nrighteousness. I will sleep on that couch to-morrow night!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear, my lady! and the king arrives to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe more need that I resolve. It cannot be that misery so intense\r\nshould dwell in any heart, and no cure be found. I had hoped to be the\r\nbringer of peace to our houses; and is the good work to be for me a\r\ncrown of thorns? Heaven shall direct me. I will rest to-morrow night on\r\nSt. Catherine\u2019s bed: and if, as I have heard, the saint deigns to direct\r\nher votaries in dreams, I will be guided by her; and, believing that I\r\nact according to the dictates of Heaven, I shall feel resigned even to\r\nthe worst.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe king was on his way to Nantes from Paris, and he slept on this night\r\nat a castle but a few miles distant. Before dawn a young cavalier was\r\nintroduced into his chamber. The knight had a serious, nay, a sad\r\naspect; and all beautiful as he was in feature and limb, looked wayworn\r\nand haggard. He stood silent in Henry\u2019s presence, who, alert and gay,\r\nturned his lively blue eyes upon his guest, saying gently, \u201cSo thou\r\nfoundest her obdurate, Gaspar?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI found her resolved on our mutual misery. Alas! my liege, it is not,\r\ncredit me, the least of my grief, that Constance sacrifices her own\r\nhappiness when she destroys mine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd thou believest that she will say nay to the gaillard chevalier whom\r\nwe ourselves present to her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my liege, think not that thought! it cannot be. My heart deeply,\r\nmost deeply, thanks you for your generous condescension. But she whom\r\nher lover\u2019s voice in solitude\u2014whose entreaties, when memory and\r\nseclusion aided the spell\u2014could not persuade, will resist even your\r\nmajesty\u2019s commands. She is bent upon entering a cloister; and I, so\r\nplease you, will now take my leave:\u2014I am henceforth a soldier of the\r\ncross.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGaspar,\u201d said the monarch, \u201cI know woman better than thou. It is not by\r\nsubmission nor tearful plaints she is to be won. The death of her\r\nrelatives naturally sits heavy at the young countess\u2019s heart; and\r\nnourishing in solitude her regret and her repentance, she fancies that\r\nHeaven itself forbids your union. Let the voice of the world reach\r\nher\u2014the voice of earthly power and earthly kindness\u2014the one commanding,\r\nthe other pleading, and both finding response in her own heart\u2014and by my\r\nfay and the Holy Cross, she will be yours. Let our plan still hold. And\r\nnow to horse: the morning wears, and the sun is risen.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe king arrived at the bishop\u2019s palace, and proceeded forthwith to mass\r\nin the cathedral. A sumptuous dinner succeeded, and it was afternoon\r\nbefore the monarch proceeded through the town beside the Loire to where,\r\na little above Nantes, the Chateau Villeneuve was situated. The young\r\ncountess received him at the gate. Henry looked in vain for the cheek\r\nblanched by misery, the aspect of downcast despair which he had been\r\ntaught to expect. Her cheek was flushed, her manner animated, her voice\r\nscarce tremulous. \u201cShe loves him not,\u201d thought Henry, \u201cor already her\r\nheart has consented.\u201d\r\n\r\nA collation was prepared for the monarch; and after some little\r\nhesitation, arising even from the cheerfulness of her mien, he mentioned\r\nthe name of Gaspar. Constance blushed instead of turning pale, and\r\nreplied very quickly, \u201cTo-morrow, good my liege; I ask for a respite but\r\nuntil to-morrow;\u2014all will then be decided;\u2014to-morrow I am vowed to\r\nGod\u2014or\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\nShe looked confused, and the king, at once surprised and pleased, said,\r\n\u201cThen you hate not young De Vaudemont;\u2014you forgive him for the inimical\r\nblood that warms his veins.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are taught that we should forgive, that we should love our enemies,\u201d\r\nthe countess replied, with some trepidation.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, by Saint Denis, that is a right welcome answer for the novice,\u201d\r\nsaid the king, laughing. \u201cWhat ho! my faithful serving-man, Dan Apollo\r\nin disguise! come forward, and thank your lady for her love.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn such disguise as had concealed him from all, the cavalier had hung\r\nbehind, and viewed with infinite surprise the demeanour and calm\r\ncountenance of the lady. He could not hear her words: but was this even\r\nshe whom he had seen trembling and weeping the evening before?\u2014this she\r\nwhose very heart was torn by conflicting passion?\u2014who saw the pale\r\nghosts of parent and kinsman stand between her and the lover whom more\r\nthan her life she adored? It was a riddle hard to solve. The king\u2019s call\r\nwas in unison with his impatience, and he sprang forward. He was at her\r\nfeet; while she, still passion-driven, overwrought by the very calmness\r\nshe had assumed, uttered one cry as she recognised him, and sank\r\nsenseless on the floor.\r\n\r\nAll this was very unintelligible. Even when her attendants had brought\r\nher to life, another fit succeeded, and then passionate floods of tears;\r\nwhile the monarch, waiting in the hall, eyeing the half-eaten collation,\r\nand humming some romance in commemoration of woman\u2019s waywardness, knew\r\nnot how to reply to Vaudemont\u2019s look of bitter disappointment and\r\nanxiety. At length the countess\u2019 chief attendant came with an apology:\r\n\u201cHer lady was ill, very ill The next day she would throw herself at the\r\nking\u2019s feet, at once to solicit his excuse, and to disclose her\r\npurpose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-morrow\u2014again to-morrow!\u2014Does to-morrow bear some charm, maiden?\u201d\r\nsaid the king. \u201cCan you read us the riddle, pretty one? What strange\r\ntale belongs to to-morrow, that all rests on its advent?\u201d\r\n\r\nManon coloured, looked down, and hesitated. But Henry was no tyro in the\r\nart of enticing ladies\u2019 attendants to disclose their ladies\u2019 counsel.\r\nManon was besides frightened by the countess\u2019 scheme, on which she was\r\nstill obstinately bent, so she was the more readily induced to betray\r\nit. To sleep in St. Catherine\u2019s bed, to rest on a narrow ledge\r\noverhanging the deep rapid Loire, and if, as was most probable, the\r\nluckless dreamer escaped from falling into it, to take the disturbed\r\nvisions that such uneasy slumber might produce for the dictate of\r\nHeaven, was a madness of which even Henry himself could scarcely deem\r\nany woman capable. But could Constance, her whose beauty was so highly\r\nintellectual, and whom he had heard perpetually praised for her strength\r\nof mind and talents, could _she_ be so strangely infatuated! And can\r\npassion play such freaks with us?\u2014like death, levelling even the\r\naristocracy of the soul, and bringing noble and peasant, the wise and\r\nfoolish, under one thraldom? It was strange\u2014yet she must have her way.\r\nThat she hesitated in her decision was much; and it was to be hoped that\r\nSt. Catherine would play no ill-natured part. Should it be otherwise, a\r\npurpose to be swayed by a dream might be influenced by other waking\r\nthoughts. To the more material kind of danger some safeguard should be\r\nbrought.\r\n\r\nThere is no feeling more awful than that which invades a weak human\r\nheart bent upon gratifying its ungovernable impulses in contradiction to\r\nthe dictates of conscience. Forbidden pleasures are said to be the most\r\nagreeable;\u2014it may be so to rude natures, to those who love to struggle,\r\ncombat, and contend; who find happiness in a fray, and joy in the\r\nconflict of passion. But softer and sweeter was the gentle spirit of\r\nConstance; and love and duty contending crushed and tortured her poor\r\nheart. To commit her conduct to the inspirations of religion, or, if it\r\nwas so to be named, of superstition, was a blessed relief. The very\r\nperils that threatened her undertaking gave a zest to it;\u2014to dare for\r\nhis sake was happiness;\u2014the very difficulty of the way that led to the\r\ncompletion of her wishes at once gratified her love and distracted her\r\nthoughts from her despair. Or if it was decreed that she must sacrifice\r\nall, the risk of danger and of death were of trifling import in\r\ncomparison with the anguish which would then be her portion for ever.\r\n\r\nThe night threatened to be stormy, the raging wind shook the casements,\r\nand the trees waved their huge shadowy arms, as giants might in\r\nfantastic dance and mortal broil. Constance and Manon, unattended,\r\nquitted the chateau by a postern, and began to descend the hill-side.\r\nThe moon had not yet risen; and though the way was familiar to both,\r\nManon tottered and trembled; while the countess, drawing her silken\r\ncloak round her, walked with a firm step down the steep. They came to\r\nthe river\u2019s side, where a small boat was moored, and one man was in\r\nwaiting. Constance stepped lightly in, and then aided her fearful\r\ncompanion. In a few moments they were in the middle of the stream. The\r\nwarm, tempestuous, animating, equinoctial wind swept over them. For the\r\nfirst time since her mourning, a thrill of pleasure swelled the bosom of\r\nConstance. She hailed the emotion with double joy. It cannot be, she\r\nthought, that Heaven will forbid me to love one so brave, so generous,\r\nand so good as the noble Gaspar. Another I can never love; I shall die\r\nif divided from him; and this heart, these limbs, so alive with glowing\r\nsensation, are they already predestined to an early grave? Oh no! life\r\nspeaks aloud within them. I shall live to love. Do not all things\r\nlove?\u2014the winds as they whisper to the rushing waters? the waters as\r\nthey kiss the flowery banks, and speed to mingle with the sea? Heaven\r\nand earth are sustained by, and live through, love; and shall Constance\r\nalone, whose heart has ever been a deep, gushing, overflowing well of\r\ntrue affection, be compelled to set a stone upon the fount to lock it up\r\nfor ever?\r\n\r\nThese thoughts bade fair for pleasant dreams; and perhaps the countess,\r\nan adept in the blind god\u2019s lore, therefore indulged them the more\r\nreadily. But as thus she was engrossed by soft emotions, Manon caught\r\nher arm:\u2014\u201cLady, look,\u201d she cried; \u201cit comes\u2014yet the oars have no sound.\r\nNow the Virgin shield us! Would we were at home!\u201d\r\n\r\nA dark boat glided by them. Four rowers, habited in black cloaks, pulled\r\nat oars which, as Manon said, gave no sound; another sat at the helm:\r\nlike the rest, his person was veiled in a dark mantle, but he wore no\r\ncap; and though his face was turned from them, Constance recognised her\r\nlover. \u201cGaspar,\u201d she cried aloud, \u201cdost thou live?\u201d\u2014but the figure in\r\nthe boat neither turned its head nor replied, and quickly it was lost in\r\nthe shadowy waters.\r\n\r\nHow changed now was the fair countess\u2019 reverie! Already Heaven had begun\r\nits spell, and unearthly forms were around, as she strained her eyes\r\nthrough the gloom. Now she saw and now she lost view of the bark that\r\noccasioned her terror; and now it seemed that another was there, which\r\nheld the spirits of the dead; and her father waved to her from shore,\r\nand her brothers frowned on her.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile they neared the landing. Her bark was moored in a little cove,\r\nand Constance stood upon the bank. Now she trembled, and half yielded to\r\nManon\u2019s entreaty to return; till the unwise _suivante_ mentioned the\r\nking\u2019s and De Vaudemont\u2019s name, and spoke of the answer to be given\r\nto-morrow. What answer, if she turned back from her intent?\r\n\r\nShe now hurried forward up the broken ground of the bank, and then along\r\nits edge, till they came to a hill which abruptly hung over the tide. A\r\nsmall chapel stood near. With trembling fingers the countess drew forth\r\nthe key and unlocked its door. They entered. It was dark\u2014save that a\r\nlittle lamp, flickering in the wind, showed an uncertain light from\r\nbefore the figure of Saint Catherine. The two women knelt; they prayed;\r\nand then rising, with a cheerful accent the countess bade her attendant\r\ngood-night. She unlocked a little low iron door. It opened on a narrow\r\ncavern. The roar of waters was heard beyond. \u201cThou mayest not follow, my\r\npoor Manon,\u201d said Constance,\u2014\u201cnor dost thou much desire:\u2014this adventure\r\nis for me alone.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was hardly fair to leave the trembling servant in the chapel alone,\r\nwho had neither hope nor fear, nor love, nor grief to beguile her; but,\r\nin those days, esquires and waiting-women often played the part of\r\nsubalterns in the army, gaining knocks and no fame. Besides, Manon was\r\nsafe in holy ground. The countess meanwhile pursued her way groping in\r\nthe dark through the narrow tortuous passage. At length what seemed\r\nlight to her long-darkened sense gleamed on her. She reached an open\r\ncavern in the overhanging hill\u2019s side, looking over the rushing tide\r\nbeneath. She looked out upon the night. The waters of the Loire were\r\nspeeding, as since that day have they ever sped\u2014changeful, yet the same;\r\nthe heavens were thickly veiled with clouds, and the wind in the trees\r\nwas as mournful and ill-omened as if it rushed round a murderer\u2019s tomb.\r\nConstance shuddered a little, and looked upon her bed,\u2014a narrow ledge of\r\nearth and a moss-grown stone bordering on the very verge of the\r\nprecipice. She doffed her mantle,\u2014such was one of the conditions of the\r\nspell;\u2014she bowed her head, and loosened the tresses of her dark hair;\r\nshe bared her feet; and thus, fully prepared for suffering to the utmost\r\nthe chill influence of the cold night, she stretched herself on the\r\nnarrow couch that scarce afforded room for her repose, and whence, if\r\nshe moved in sleep, she must be precipitated into the cold waters below.\r\n\r\nAt first it seemed to her as if she never should sleep again. No great\r\nwonder that exposure to the blast and her perilous position should\r\nforbid her eyelids to close. At length she fell into a reverie so soft\r\nand soothing that she wished even to watch; and then by degrees her\r\nsenses became confused; and now she was on St. Catherine\u2019s bed\u2014the Loire\r\nrushing beneath, and the wild wind sweeping by\u2014and now\u2014oh whither?\u2014and\r\nwhat dreams did the saint send, to drive her to despair, or to bid her\r\nbe blest for ever?\r\n\r\nBeneath the rugged hill, upon the dark tide, another watched, who feared\r\na thousand things, and scarce dared hope. He had meant to precede the\r\nlady on her way, but when he found that he had outstayed his time, with\r\nmuffled oars and breathless haste he had shot by the bark that contained\r\nhis Constance, nor even turned at her voice, fearful to incur her blame,\r\nand her commands to return. He had seen her emerge from the passage, and\r\nshuddered as she leant over the cliff. He saw her step forth, clad as\r\nshe was in white, and could mark her as she lay on the ledge beetling\r\nabove. What a vigil did the lovers keep!\u2014she given up to visionary\r\nthoughts, he knowing\u2014and the consciousness thrilled his bosom with\r\nstrange emotion\u2014that love, and love for him, had led her to that\r\nperilous couch; and that while dangers surrounded her in every shape,\r\nshe was alive only to the small still voice that whispered to her heart\r\nthe dream which was to decide their destinies. She slept perhaps\u2014but he\r\nwaked and watched, and night wore away, as, now praying, now entranced\r\nby alternating hope and fear, he sat in his boat, his eyes fixed on the\r\nwhite garb of the slumberer above.\r\n\r\nMorning\u2014was it morning that struggled in the clouds? Would morning ever\r\ncome to waken her? And had she slept? and what dreams of weal or woe had\r\npeopled her sleep? Gaspar grew impatient. He commanded his boatmen still\r\nto wait, and he sprang forward, intent on clambering the precipice. In\r\nvain they urged the danger, nay, the impossibility of the attempt; he\r\nclung to the rugged face of the hill, and found footing where it would\r\nseem no footing was. The acclivity, indeed, was not high; the dangers of\r\nSt. Catherine\u2019s bed arising from the likelihood that any one who slept\r\non so narrow a couch would be precipitated into the waters beneath. Up\r\nthe steep ascent Gaspar continued to toil, and at last reached the roots\r\nof a tree that grew near the summit. Aided by its branches, he made good\r\nhis stand at the very extremity of the ledge, near the pillow on which\r\nlay the uncovered head of his beloved. Her hands were folded on her\r\nbosom; her dark hair fell round her throat and pillowed her cheek; her\r\nface was serene: sleep was there in all its innocence and in all its\r\nhelplessness; every wilder emotion was hushed, and her bosom heaved in\r\nregular breathing. He could see her heart beat as it lifted her fair\r\nhands crossed above. No statue hewn of marble in monumental effigy was\r\never half so fair; and within that surpassing form dwelt a soul true,\r\ntender, self-devoted, and affectionate as ever warmed a human breast.\r\n\r\nWith what deep passion did Gaspar gaze, gathering hope from the\r\nplacidity of her angel countenance! A smile wreathed her lips; and he\r\ntoo involuntarily smiled, as he hailed the happy omen; when suddenly her\r\ncheek was flushed, her bosom heaved, a tear stole from her dark lashes,\r\nand then a whole shower fell, as starting up she cried, \u201cNo!\u2014he shall\r\nnot die!\u2014I will unloose his chains!\u2014I will save him!\u201d Gaspar\u2019s hand was\r\nthere. He caught her light form ready to fall from the perilous couch.\r\nShe opened her eyes and beheld her lover, who had watched over her dream\r\nof fate, and who had saved her.\r\n\r\nManon also had slept well, dreaming or not, and was startled in the\r\nmorning to find that she waked surrounded by a crowd. The little\r\ndesolate chapel was hung with tapestry\u2014the altar adorned with golden\r\nchalices\u2014the priest was chanting mass to a goodly array of kneeling\r\nknights. Manon saw that King Henry was there; and she looked for another\r\nwhom she found not, when the iron door of the cavern passage opened, and\r\nGaspar de Vaudemont entered from it, leading the fair form of Constance;\r\nwho, in her white robes and dark dishevelled hair, with a face in which\r\nsmiles and blushes contended with deeper emotion, approached the altar,\r\nand, kneeling with her lover, pronounced the vows that united them for\r\never.\r\n\r\nIt was long before the happy Gaspar could win from his lady the secret\r\nof her dream. In spite of the happiness she now enjoyed, she had\r\nsuffered too much not to look back even with terror to those days when\r\nshe thought love a crime, and every event connected with them wore an\r\nawful aspect. \u201cMany a vision,\u201d she said, \u201cshe had that fearful night.\r\nShe had seen the spirits of her father and brothers in Paradise; she had\r\nbeheld Gaspar victoriously combating among the infidels; she had beheld\r\nhim in King Henry\u2019s court, favoured and beloved; and she herself\u2014now\r\npining in a cloister, now a bride, now grateful to Heaven for the full\r\nmeasure of bliss presented to her, now weeping away her sad days\u2014till\r\nsuddenly she thought herself in Paynim land; and the saint herself, St\r\nCatherine, guiding her unseen through the city of the infidels. She\r\nentered a palace, and beheld the miscreants rejoicing in victory; and\r\nthen, descending to the dungeons beneath, they groped their way through\r\ndamp vaults, and low, mildewed passages, to one cell, darker and more\r\nfrightful than the rest. On the floor lay one with soiled and tattered\r\ngarments, with unkempt locks and wild, matted beard. His cheek was worn\r\nand thin; his eyes had lost their fire; his form was a mere skeleton;\r\nthe chains hung loosely on the fleshless bones.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd was it my appearance in that attractive state and winning costume\r\nthat softened the hard heart of Constance!\u201d asked Gaspar, smiling at\r\nthis painting of what would never be.\r\n\r\n\u201cEven so,\u201d replied Constance; \u201cfor my heart whispered me that this was\r\nmy doing; and who could recall the life that waned in your pulses\u2014who\r\nrestore, save the destroyer! My heart never warmed to my living, happy\r\nknight as then it did to his wasted image as it lay, in the visions of\r\nnight, at my feet. A veil fell from my eyes; a darkness was dispelled\r\nfrom before me. Methought I then knew for the first time what life and\r\nwhat death was. I was bid believe that to make the living happy was not\r\nto injure the dead; and I felt how wicked and how vain was that false\r\nphilosophy which placed virtue and good in hatred and unkindness. You\r\nshould not die; I would loosen your chains and save you, and bid you\r\nlive for love. I sprung forward, and the death I deprecated for you\r\nwould, in my presumption, have been mine,\u2014then, when first I felt the\r\nreal value of life,\u2014but that your arm was there to save me, your dear\r\nvoice to bid me be blest for evermore.\u201d\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V.\r\n\r\n                             _THE MOURNER._\r\n\r\n          \u201cOne fatal remembrance, one sorrow that throws\r\n           Its bleak shade alike o\u2019er our joys and our woes,\r\n           To which life nothing darker or brighter can bring,\r\n           For which joy has no balm, and affliction no sting!\u201d\r\n                         \u2014MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GORGEOUS scene of kingly pride is the prospect now before us!\u2014the\r\noffspring of art, the nursling of nature\u2014where can the eye rest on a\r\nlandscape more deliciously lovely than the fair expanse of Virginia\r\nWater, now an open mirror to the sky, now shaded by umbrageous banks,\r\nwhich wind into dark recesses, or are rounded into soft promontories?\r\nLooking down on it, now that the sun is low in the west, the eye is\r\ndazzled, the soul oppressed, by excess of beauty. Earth, water, air\r\ndrink to overflowing the radiance that streams from yonder well of\r\nlight; the foliage of the trees seems dripping with the golden flood;\r\nwhile the lake, filled with no earthly dew, appears but an imbasining of\r\nthe sun-tinctured atmosphere; and trees and gay pavilion float in its\r\ndepth, more dear, more distinct than their twins in the upper air. Nor\r\nis the scene silent: strains more sweet than those that lull Venus to\r\nher balmy rest, more inspiring than the song of Tiresias which awoke\r\nAlexander to the deed of ruin, more solemn than the chantings of St.\r\nCecilia, float along the waves and mingle with the lagging breeze, which\r\nruffles not the lake. Strange, that a few dark scores should be the key\r\nto this fountain of sound; the unconscious link between unregarded noise\r\nand harmonies which unclose paradise to our entranced senses!\r\n\r\nThe sun touches the extreme boundary, and a softer, milder light mingles\r\na roseate tinge with the fiery glow. Our boat has floated long on the\r\nbroad expanse; now let it approach the umbrageous bank. The green\r\ntresses of the graceful willow dip into the waters, which are checked by\r\nthem into a ripple. The startled teal dart from their recess, skimming\r\nthe waves with splashing wing. The stately swans float onward; while\r\ninnumerable waterfowl cluster together out of the way of the oars. The\r\ntwilight is blotted by no dark shades; it is one subdued, equal receding\r\nof the great tide of day. We may disembark, and wander yet amid the\r\nglades, long before the thickening shadows speak of night. The\r\nplantations are formed of every English tree, with an old oak or two\r\nstanding out in the walks. There the glancing foliage obscures heaven,\r\nas the silken texture of a veil a woman\u2019s lovely features. Beneath such\r\nfretwork we may indulge in light-hearted thoughts; or, if sadder\r\nmeditations lead us to seek darker shades, we may pass the cascade\r\ntowards the large groves of pine, with their vast undergrowth of laurel,\r\nreaching up to the Belvidere; or, on the opposite side of the water, sit\r\nunder the shadow of the silver-stemmed birch, or beneath the leafy\r\npavilions of those fine old beeches, whose high fantastic roots seem\r\nformed in nature\u2019s sport; and the near jungle of sweet-smelling myrica\r\nleaves no sense unvisited by pleasant ministration.\r\n\r\nNow this splendid scene is reserved for the royal possessor; but in past\r\nyears; while the lodge was called the Regent\u2019s Cottage, or before, when\r\nthe under-ranger inhabited it, the mazy paths of Chapel Wood were open,\r\nand the iron gates enclosing the plantations and Virginia Water were\r\nguarded by no Cerebus untamable by sops. It was here, on a summer\u2019s\r\nevening, that Horace Neville and his two fair cousins floated idly on\r\nthe placid lake,\r\n\r\n               \u201cIn that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts\r\n                Bring sad thoughts to the mind.\u201d\r\n\r\nNeville had been eloquent in praise of English scenery. \u201cIn distant\r\nclimes,\u201d he said, \u201cwe may find landscapes grand in barbaric wildness, or\r\nrich in the luxuriant vegetation of the south, or sublime in Alpine\r\nmagnificence. We may lament, though it is ungrateful to say so on such a\r\nnight as this, the want of a more genial sky; but where find scenery to\r\nbe compared to the verdant, well-wooded, well-watered groves of our\r\nnative land; the clustering cottages, shadowed by fine old elms; each\r\ngarden blooming with early flowers, each lattice gay with geraniums and\r\nroses; the blue-eyed child devouring his white bread, while he drives a\r\ncow to graze; the hedge redolent with summer blooms; the enclosed\r\ncornfields, seas of golden grain, weltering in the breeze; the stile,\r\nthe track across the meadow, leading through the copse, under which the\r\npath winds, and the meeting branches overhead, which give, by their\r\ndimming tracery, a cathedral-like solemnity to the scene; the river,\r\nwinding \u2018with sweet inland murmur;\u2019 and, as additional graces, spots\r\nlike these\u2014oases of taste\u2014gardens of Eden\u2014the works of wealth, which\r\nevince at once the greatest power and the greatest will to create\r\nbeauty?\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d continued Neville, \u201cit was with difficulty that I persuaded\r\nmyself to reap the best fruits of my uncle\u2019s will, and to inhabit this\r\nspot, familiar to my boyhood, associated with unavailing regrets and\r\nrecollected pain.\u201d\r\n\r\nHorace Neville was a man of birth\u2014of wealth; but he could hardly be\r\ntermed a man of the world. There was in his nature a gentleness, a\r\nsweetness, a winning sensibility, allied to talent and personal\r\ndistinction, that gave weight to his simplest expressions, and excited\r\nsympathy for all his emotions. His younger cousin, his junior by several\r\nyears, was attached to him by the tenderest sentiments\u2014secret long\u2014but\r\nthey were now betrothed to each other\u2014a lovely, happy pair. She looked\r\ninquiringly, but he turned away. \u201cNo more of this,\u201d he said, and, giving\r\na swifter impulse to their boat, they speedily reached the shore,\r\nlanded, and walked through the long extent of Chapel Wood. It was dark\r\nnight before they met their carriage at Bishopsgate.\r\n\r\nA week or two after, Horace received letters to call him to a distant\r\npart of the country. A few days before his departure, he requested his\r\ncousin to walk with him. They bent their steps across several meadows to\r\nOld Windsor Churchyard. At first he did not deviate from the usual path;\r\nand as they went they talked cheerfully\u2014gaily. The beauteous sunny day\r\nmight well exhilarate them; the dancing waves sped onwards at their\r\nfeet; the country church lifted its rustic spire into the bright pure\r\nsky. There was nothing in their conversation that could induce his\r\ncousin to think that Neville had led her hither for any saddening\r\npurpose; but when they were about to quit the churchyard, Horace, as if\r\nhe had suddenly recollected himself, turned from the path, crossed the\r\ngreensward, and paused beside a grave near the river. No stone was there\r\nto commemorate the being who reposed beneath\u2014it was thickly grown with\r\ngrass, starred by a luxuriant growth of humble daisies: a few dead\r\nleaves, a broken bramble twig, defaced its neatness. Neville removed\r\nthese, and then said, \u201cJuliet, I commit this sacred spot to your keeping\r\nwhile I am away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no monument,\u201d he continued; \u201cfor her commands were implicitly\r\nobeyed by the two beings to whom she addressed them. One day another may\r\nlie near, and his name will be her epitaph. I do not mean myself,\u201d he\r\nsaid, half-smiling at the terror his cousin\u2019s countenance expressed;\r\n\u201cbut promise me, Juliet, to preserve this grave from every violation. I\r\ndo not wish to sadden you by the story; yet, if I have excited your\r\ninterest, I will satisfy it; but not now\u2014not here.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was not till the following day, when, in company with her sister,\r\nthey again visited Virginia Water, that, seated under the shadow of its\r\npines, whose melodious swinging in the wind breathed unearthly harmony,\r\nNeville, unasked, commenced his story.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was sent to Eton at eleven years of age. I will not dwell upon my\r\nsufferings there; I would hardly refer to them, did they not make a part\r\nof my present narration. I was a fag to a hard taskmaster; every labour\r\nhe could invent\u2014and the youthful tyrant was ingenious\u2014he devised for my\r\nannoyance; early and late, I was forced to be in attendance, to the\r\nneglect of my school duties, so incurring punishment. There were worse\r\nthings to bear than these: it was his delight to put me to shame, and,\r\nfinding that I had too much of my mother in my blood,\u2014to endeavour to\r\ncompel me to acts of cruelty from which my nature revolted,\u2014I refused to\r\nobey. Speak of West Indian slavery! I hope things may be better now; in\r\nmy days, the tender years of aristocratic childhood were yielded up to a\r\ncapricious, unrelenting, cruel bondage, far beyond the measured\r\ndespotism of Jamaica.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne day\u2014I had been two years at school, and was nearly thirteen\u2014my\r\ntyrant, I will give him no other name, issued a command, in the\r\nwantonness of power, for me to destroy a poor little bullfinch I had\r\ntamed and caged. In a hapless hour he found it in my room, and was\r\nindignant that I should dare to appropriate a single pleasure. I\r\nrefused, stubbornly, dauntlessly, though the consequence of my\r\ndisobedience was immediate and terrible. At this moment a message came\r\nfrom my tormentor\u2019s tutor\u2014his father had arrived. \u2018Well, old lad,\u2019 he\r\ncried, \u2018I shall pay you off some day!\u2019 Seizing my pet at the same time,\r\nhe wrung its neck, threw it at my feet, and, with a laugh of derision,\r\nquitted the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever before\u2014never may I again feel the same swelling, boiling fury in\r\nmy bursting heart;\u2014the sight of my nursling expiring at my feet\u2014my\r\ndesire of vengeance\u2014my impotence, created a Vesuvius within me, that no\r\ntears flowed to quench. Could I have uttered\u2014acted\u2014my passion, it would\r\nhave been less torturous: it was so when I burst into a torrent of abuse\r\nand imprecation. My vocabulary\u2014it must have been a choice collection\u2014was\r\nsupplied by him against whom it was levelled. But words were air. I\r\ndesired to give more substantial proof of my resentment\u2014I destroyed\r\neverything in the room belonging to him; I tore them to pieces, I\r\nstamped on them, crushed them with more than childish strength. My last\r\nact was to seize a timepiece, on which my tyrant infinitely prided\r\nhimself, and to dash it to the ground. The sight of this, as it lay\r\nshattered at my feet, recalled me to my senses, and something like an\r\nemotion of fear allayed the tumult in my heart. I began to meditate an\r\nescape: I got out of the house, ran down a lane, and across some\r\nmeadows, far out of bounds, above Eton. I was seen by an elder boy, a\r\nfriend of my tormentor. He called to me, thinking at first that I was\r\nperforming some errand for him; but seeing that I _shirked_, he repeated\r\nhis \u2018_Come up!_\u2019 in an authoritative voice. It put wings to my heels; he\r\ndid not deem it necessary to pursue. But I grow tedious, my dear Juliet;\r\nenough that fears the most intense, of punishment both from my masters\r\nand the upper boys, made me resolve to run away. I reached the banks of\r\nthe Thames, tied my clothes over my head, swam across, and, traversing\r\nseveral fields, entered Windsor Forest, with a vague childish feeling of\r\nbeing able to hide myself for ever in the unexplored obscurity of its\r\nimmeasurable wilds. It was early autumn; the weather was mild, even\r\nwarm; the forest oaks yet showed no sign of winter change, though the\r\nfern beneath wore a yellowy tinge. I got within Chapel Wood; I fed upon\r\nchestnuts and beechnuts; I continued to hide myself from the gamekeepers\r\nand woodmen. I lived thus two days.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut chestnuts and beechnuts were sorry fare to a growing lad of\r\nthirteen years old. A day\u2019s rain occurred, and I began to think myself\r\nthe most unfortunate boy on record. I had a distant, obscure idea of\r\nstarvation: I thought of the Children in the Wood, of their leafy\r\nshroud, gift of the pious robin; this brought my poor bullfinch to my\r\nmind, and tears streamed in torrents down my cheeks. I thought of my\r\nfather and mother; of you, then my little baby cousin and playmate; and\r\nI cried with renewed fervour, till, quite exhausted, I curled myself up\r\nunder a huge oak among some dry leaves, the relics of a hundred summers,\r\nand fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\u201cI ramble on in my narration as if I had a story to tell; yet I have\r\nlittle except a portrait\u2014a sketch\u2014to present, for your amusement or\r\ninterest. When I awoke, the first object that met my opening eyes was a\r\nlittle foot, delicately clad in silk and soft kid. I looked up in\r\ndismay, expecting to behold some gaily dressed appendage to this\r\nindication of high-bred elegance; but I saw a girl, perhaps seventeen,\r\nsimply clad in a dark cotton dress, her face shaded by a large, very\r\ncoarse straw hat; she was pale even to marmoreal whiteness; her\r\nchestnut-coloured hair was parted in plain tresses across a brow which\r\nwore traces of extreme suffering; her eyes were blue, full, large,\r\nmelancholy, often even suffused with tears; but her mouth had an\r\ninfantine sweetness and innocence in its expression, that softened the\r\notherwise sad expression of her countenance.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe spoke to me. I was too hungry, too exhausted, too unhappy, to\r\nresist her kindness, and gladly permitted her to lead me to her home. We\r\npassed out of the wood by some broken palings on to Bishopsgate Heath,\r\nand after no long walk arrived at her habitation. It was a solitary,\r\ndreary-looking cottage; the palings were in disrepair, the garden waste,\r\nthe lattices unadorned by flowers or creepers; within, all was neat, but\r\nsombre, and even mean. The diminutiveness of a cottage requires an\r\nappearance of cheerfulness and elegance to make it pleasing; the bare\r\nfloor,\u2014clean, it is true,\u2014the rush chairs, deal table, checked curtains\r\nof this cot, were beneath even a peasant\u2019s rusticity; yet it was the\r\ndwelling of my lovely guide, whose little white hand, delicately gloved,\r\ncontrasted with her unadorned attire, as did her gentle self with the\r\nclumsy appurtenances of her too humble dwelling.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor child! she had meant entirely to hide her origin, to degrade\r\nherself to a peasant\u2019s state, and little thought that she for ever\r\nbetrayed herself by the strangest incongruities. Thus, the arrangements\r\nof her table were mean, her fare meagre for a hermit; but the linen was\r\nmatchlessly fine, and wax lights stood in candlesticks which a beggar\r\nwould almost have disdained to own. But I talk of circumstances I\r\nobserved afterwards; then I was chiefly aware of the plentiful breakfast\r\nshe caused her single attendant, a young girl, to place before me, and\r\nof the sweet soothing voice of my hostess, which spoke a kindness with\r\nwhich lately I had been little conversant. When my hunger was appeased,\r\nshe drew my story from me, encouraged me to write to my father, and kept\r\nme at her abode till, after a few days, I returned to school pardoned.\r\nNo long time elapsed before I got into the upper forms, and my woful\r\nslavery ended.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhenever I was able, I visited my disguised nymph. I no longer\r\nassociated with my schoolfellows; their diversions, their pursuits\r\nappeared vulgar and stupid to me; I had but one object in view\u2014to\r\naccomplish my lessons, and to steal to the cottage of Ellen Burnet.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not look grave, love! true, others as young as I then was have\r\nloved, and I might also; but not Ellen. Her profound, her intense\r\nmelancholy, sister to despair\u2014her serious, sad discourse\u2014her mind,\r\nestranged from all worldly concerns, forbade that; but there was an\r\nenchantment in her sorrow, a fascination in her converse, that lifted me\r\nabove commonplace existence; she created a magic circle, which I entered\r\nas holy ground: it was not akin to heaven, for grief was the presiding\r\nspirit; but there was an exaltation of sentiment, an enthusiasm, a view\r\nbeyond the grave, which made it unearthly, singular, wild, enthralling.\r\nYou have often observed that I strangely differ from all other men; I\r\nmingle with them, make one in their occupations and diversions, but I\r\nhave a portion of my being sacred from them:\u2014a living well, sealed up\r\nfrom their contamination, lies deep in my heart\u2014it is of little use, but\r\nthere it is; Ellen opened the spring, and it has flowed ever since.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf what did she talk? She recited no past adventures, alluded to no\r\npast intercourse with friend or relative; she spoke of the various woes\r\nthat wait on humanity, on the intricate mazes of life, on the miseries\r\nof passion, of love, remorse, and death, and that which we may hope or\r\nfear beyond the tomb; she spoke of the sensation of wretchedness alive\r\nin her own broken heart, and then she grew fearfully eloquent, till,\r\nsuddenly pausing, she reproached herself for making me familiar with\r\nsuch wordless misery. \u2018I do you harm,\u2019 she often said; \u2018I unfit you for\r\nsociety; I have tried, seeing you thrown upon yonder distorted miniature\r\nof a bad world, to estrange you from its evil contagion; I fear that I\r\nshall be the cause of greater harm to you than could spring from\r\nassociation with your fellow-creatures in the ordinary course of things.\r\nThis is not well\u2014avoid the stricken deer.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were darker shades in the picture than those which I have already\r\ndeveloped. Ellen was more miserable than the imagination of one like\r\nyou, dear girl, unacquainted with woe, can portray. Sometimes she gave\r\nwords to her despair\u2014it was so great as to confuse the boundary between\r\nphysical and mental sensation\u2014and every pulsation of her heart was a\r\nthrob of pain. She has suddenly broken off in talking of her sorrows,\r\nwith a cry of agony\u2014bidding me leave her\u2014hiding her face on her arms,\r\nshivering with the anguish some thought awoke. The idea that chiefly\r\nhaunted her, though she earnestly endeavoured to put it aside, was\r\nself-destruction\u2014to snap the silver cord that bound together so much\r\ngrace, wisdom, and sweetness\u2014to rob the world of a creation made to be\r\nits ornament. Sometimes her piety checked her; oftener a sense of\r\nunendurable suffering made her brood with pleasure over the dread\r\nresolve. She spoke of it to me as being wicked; yet I often fancied this\r\nwas done rather to prevent her example from being of ill effect to me,\r\nthan from any conviction that the Father of all would regard angrily the\r\nlast act of His miserable child. Once she had prepared the mortal\r\nbeverage; it was on the table before her when I entered; she did not\r\ndeny its nature, she did not attempt to justify herself; she only\r\nbesought me not to hate her, and to soothe by my kindness her last\r\nmoments.\u2014\u2018I cannot live!\u2019 was all her explanation, all her excuse; and\r\nit was spoken with such fervent wretchedness that it seemed wrong to\r\nattempt to persuade her to prolong the sense of pain. I did not act like\r\na boy; I wonder I did not; I made one simple request, to which she\r\ninstantly acceded, that she should walk with me to this Belvidere. It\r\nwas a glorious sunset; beauty and the spirit of love breathed in the\r\nwind, and hovered over the softened hues of the landscape. \u2018Look,\r\nEllen,\u2019 I cried, \u2018if only such loveliness of nature existed, it were\r\nworth living for!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018True, if a latent feeling did not blot this glorious scene with murky\r\nshadows. Beauty is as we see it\u2014my eyes view all things deformed and\r\nevil.\u2019 She closed them as she said this; but, young and sensitive, the\r\nvisitings of the soft breeze already began to minister consolation.\r\n\u2018Dearest Ellen,\u2019 I continued, \u2018what do I not owe to you? I am your boy,\r\nyour pupil; I might have gone on blindly as others do, but you opened my\r\neyes; you have given me a sense of the just, the good, the beautiful\u2014and\r\nhave you done this merely for my misfortune? If you leave me, what can\r\nbecome of me?\u2019 The last words came from my heart, and tears gushed from\r\nmy eyes. \u2018Do not leave me, Ellen,\u2019 I said; \u2018I cannot live without\r\nyou\u2014and I cannot die, for I have a mother\u2014a father.\u2019 She turned quickly\r\nround, saying, \u2018You are blessed sufficiently.\u2019 Her voice struck me as\r\nunnatural; she grew deadly pale as she spoke, and was obliged to sit\r\ndown. Still I clung to her, prayed, cried; till she\u2014I had never seen her\r\nshed a tear before\u2014burst into passionate weeping. After this she seemed\r\nto forget her resolve. We returned by moonlight, and our talk was even\r\nmore calm and cheerful than usual. When in her cottage, I poured away\r\nthe fatal draught. Her \u2018good-night\u2019 bore with it no traces of her late\r\nagitation; and the next day she said, \u2018I have thoughtlessly, even\r\nwickedly, created a new duty to myself, even at a time when I had\r\nforsworn all; but I will be true to it. Pardon me for making you\r\nfamiliar with emotions and scenes so dire; I will behave better\u2014I will\r\npreserve myself if I can, till the link between us is loosened, or\r\nbroken, and I am free again.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cOne little incident alone occurred during our intercourse that appeared\r\nat all to connect her with the world. Sometimes I brought her a\r\nnewspaper, for those were stirring times; and though, before I knew her,\r\nshe had forgotten all except the world her own heart enclosed, yet, to\r\nplease me, she would talk of Napoleon\u2014Russia, from whence the emperor\r\nnow returned overthrown\u2014and the prospect of his final defeat. The paper\r\nlay one day on her table; some words caught her eye; she bent eagerly\r\ndown to read them, and her bosom heaved with violent palpitation; but\r\nshe subdued herself, and after a few moments told me to take the paper\r\naway. Then, indeed, I did feel an emotion of even impertinent\r\ninquisitiveness; I found nothing to satisfy it\u2014though afterwards I\r\nbecame aware that it contained a singular advertisement, saying, \u2018If\r\nthese lines meet the eye of any one of the passengers who were on board\r\nthe _St. Mary_, bound for Liverpool from Barbadoes, which sailed on the\r\nthird of May last, and was destroyed by fire in the high seas, a part of\r\nthe crew only having been saved by his Majesty\u2019s frigate the\r\n_Bellerophon_, they are entreated to communicate with the advertiser;\r\nand if any one be acquainted with the particulars of the Hon. Miss\r\nEversham\u2019s fate and present abode, they are earnestly requested to\r\ndisclose them, directing to L. E., Stratton Street, Park Lane.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was after this event, as winter came on, that symptoms of decided\r\nill-health declared themselves in the delicate frame of my poor Ellen. I\r\nhave often suspected that, without positively attempting her life, she\r\ndid many things that tended to abridge it and to produce mortal disease.\r\nNow, when really ill, she refused all medical attendance; but she got\r\nbetter again, and I thought her nearly well when I saw her for the last\r\ntime, before going home for the Christmas holidays. Her manner was full\r\nof affection: she relied, she said, on the continuation of my\r\nfriendship; she made me promise never to forget her, though she refused\r\nto write to me, and forbade any letters from me.\r\n\r\n\u201cEven now I see her standing at her humble doorway. If an appearance of\r\nillness and suffering can ever he termed lovely, it was in her. Still\r\nshe was to be viewed as the wreck of beauty. What must she not have been\r\nin happier days, with her angel expression of face, her nymph-like\r\nfigure, her voice, whose tones were music? \u2018So young\u2014so lost!\u2019 was the\r\nsentiment that burst even from me, a young lad, as I waved my hand to\r\nher as a last adieu. She hardly looked more than fifteen, but none could\r\ndoubt that her very soul was impressed by the sad lines of sorrow that\r\nrested so unceasingly on her fair brow. Away from her, her figure for\r\never floated before my eyes;\u2014I put my hands before them, still she was\r\nthere: my day, my night dreams were filled by my recollections of her.\r\n\r\n\u201cDuring the winter holidays, on a fine soft day, I went out to hunt:\r\nyou, dear Juliet, will remember the sad catastrophe; I fell and broke my\r\nleg. The only person who saw me fall was a young man who rode one of the\r\nmost beautiful horses I ever saw, and I believe it was by watching him\r\nas he took a leap, that I incurred my disaster: he dismounted, and was\r\nat my side in a minute. My own animal had fled; he called his; it obeyed\r\nhis voice; with ease he lifted my light figure on to the saddle,\r\ncontriving to support my leg, and so conducted me a short distance to a\r\nlodge situated in the woody recesses of Elmore Park, the seat of the\r\nEarl of D\u2014\u2014, whose second son my preserver was. He was my sole nurse for\r\na day or two, and during the whole of my illness passed many hours of\r\neach day by my bedside. As I lay gazing on him, while he read to me, or\r\ntalked, narrating a thousand stranger adventures which had occurred\r\nduring his service in the Peninsula, I thought\u2014is it for ever to be my\r\nfate to fall in with the highly gifted and excessively unhappy?\r\n\r\n\u201cThe immediate neighbour of Lewis\u2019 family was Lord Eversham. He had\r\nmarried in very early youth, and became a widower young. After this\r\nmisfortune, which passed like a deadly blight over his prospects and\r\npossessions, leaving the gay view utterly sterile and bare, he left his\r\nsurviving infant daughter under the care of Lewis\u2019 mother, and travelled\r\nfor many years in far distant lands. He returned when Clarice was about\r\nten, a lovely sweet child, the pride and delight of all connected with\r\nher. Lord Eversham, on his return\u2014he was then hardly more than\r\nthirty\u2014devoted himself to her education. They were never separate: he\r\nwas a good musician, and she became a proficient under his tutoring.\r\nThey rode\u2014walked\u2014read together. When a father is all that a father may\r\nbe, the sentiments of filial piety, entire dependence, and perfect\r\nconfidence being united, the love of a daughter is one of the deepest\r\nand strongest, as it is the purest passion of which our natures are\r\ncapable. Clarice worshipped her parent, who came, during the transition\r\nfrom mere childhood to the period when reflection and observation\r\nawaken, to adorn a commonplace existence with all the brilliant adjuncts\r\nwhich enlightened and devoted affection can bestow. He appeared to her\r\nlike an especial gift of Providence, a guardian angel\u2014but far dearer, as\r\nbeing akin to her own nature. She grew, under his eye, in loveliness and\r\nrefinement both of intellect and heart. These feelings were not\r\ndivided\u2014almost strengthened, by the engagement that had taken place\r\nbetween her and Lewis:\u2014Lewis was destined for the army, and, after a few\r\nyears\u2019 service, they were to be united.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is hard, when all is fair and tranquil, when the world, opening\r\nbefore the ardent gaze of youth, looks like a well-kept demesne,\r\nunencumbered by let or hindrance for the annoyance of the young\r\ntraveller, that we should voluntarily stray into desert wilds and\r\ntempest-visited districts. Lewis Elmore was ordered to Spain; and, at\r\nthe same time, Lord Eversham found it necessary to visit some estates he\r\npossessed in Barbadoes. He was not sorry to revisit a scene, which had\r\ndwelt in his memory as an earthly paradise, nor to show to his daughter\r\na new and strange world, so to form her understanding and enlarge her\r\nmind. They were to return in three months, and departed as on a summer\r\ntour. Clarice was glad that, while her lover gathered experience and\r\nknowledge in a distant land, she should not remain in idleness; she was\r\nglad that there would be some diversion for her anxiety during his\r\nperilous absence; and in every way she enjoyed the idea of travelling\r\nwith her beloved father, who would fill every hour, and adorn every new\r\nscene, with pleasure and delight. They sailed. Clarice wrote home, with\r\nenthusiastic expressions of rapture and delight, from Madeira:\u2014yet,\r\nwithout her father, she said, the fair scene had been blank to her. More\r\nthan half her letter was filled by the expressions of her gratitude and\r\naffection for her adored and revered parent. While he, in his, with\r\nfewer words, perhaps, but with no less energy, spoke of his satisfaction\r\nin her improvement, his pride in her beauty, and his grateful sense of\r\nher love and kindness.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuch were they, a matchless example of happiness in the dearest\r\nconnection in life, as resulting from the exercise of their reciprocal\r\nduties and affections. A father and daughter; the one all care,\r\ngentleness, and sympathy, consecrating his life for her happiness; the\r\nother fond, duteous, grateful:\u2014such had they been,\u2014and where were they\r\nnow,\u2014the noble, kind, respected parent, and the beloved and loving\r\nchild! They had departed from England as on a pleasure voyage down an\r\ninland stream; but the ruthless car of destiny had overtaken them on\r\ntheir unsuspecting way, crushing them under its heavy wheels\u2014scattering\r\nlove, hope, and joy as the bellowing avalanche overwhelms and grinds to\r\nmere spray the streamlet of the valley. They were gone; but whither?\r\nMystery hung over the fate of the most helpless victim; and my friend\u2019s\r\nanxiety was, to penetrate the clouds that hid poor Clarice from his\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter an absence of a few months, they had written, fixing their\r\ndeparture in the _St. Mary_, to sail from Barbadoes in a few days.\r\nLewis, at the same time, returned from Spain: he was invalided, in his\r\nvery first action, by a bad wound in his side. He arrived, and each day\r\nexpected to hear of the landing of his friends, when that common\r\nmessenger, the newspaper, brought him tidings to fill him with more than\r\nanxiety\u2014with fear and agonizing doubt. The _St. Mary_ had caught fire,\r\nand had burned in the open sea. A frigate, the _Bellerophon_, had saved\r\na part of the crew. In spite of illness and a physician\u2019s commands,\r\nLewis set out the same day for London to ascertain as speedily as\r\npossible the fate of her he loved. There he heard that the frigate was\r\nexpected in the Downs. Without alighting from his travelling chaise, he\r\nposted thither, arriving in a burning fever. He went on board, saw the\r\ncommander, and spoke with the crew. They could give him few particulars\r\nas to whom they had saved; they had touched at Liverpool, and left there\r\nmost of the persons, including all the passengers rescued from the _St.\r\nMary_. Physical suffering for awhile disabled Mr. Elmore; he was\r\nconfined by his wound and consequent fever, and only recovered to give\r\nhimself up to his exertions to discover the fate of his friends;\u2014they\r\ndid not appear nor write; and all Lewis\u2019 inquiries only tended to\r\nconfirm his worst fears; yet still he hoped, and still continued\r\nindefatigable in his perquisitions. He visited Liverpool and Ireland,\r\nwhither some of the passengers had gone, and learnt only scattered,\r\nincongruous details of the fearful tragedy, that told nothing of Miss\r\nEversham\u2019s present abode, though much that confirmed his suspicion that\r\nshe still lived.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe fire on board the _St. Mary_ had raged long and fearfully before\r\nthe _Bellerophon_ hove in sight, and boats came off for the rescue of\r\nthe crew. The women were to be first embarked; but Clarice clung to her\r\nfather, and refused to go till he should accompany her. Some fearful\r\npresentiment that, if she were saved, he would remain and die, gave such\r\nenergy to her resolve, that not the entreaties of her father, nor the\r\nangry expostulations of the captain, could shake it. Lewis saw this man,\r\nafter the lapse of two or three months, and he threw most light on the\r\ndark scene. He well remembered that, transported with anger by her\r\nobstinacy, he had said to her, \u2018You will cause your father\u2019s death\u2014and\r\nbe as much a parricide as if you put poison into his cup; you are not\r\nthe first girl who has murdered her father in her wilful mood.\u2019 Still\r\nClarice passionately refused to go\u2014there was no time for long parley\u2014the\r\npoint was yielded, and she remained pale, but firm, near her parent,\r\nwhose arm was around her, supporting her during the awful interval. It\r\nwas no period for regular action and calm order; a tempest was rising,\r\nthe scorching waves blew this way and that, making a fearful day of the\r\nnight which veiled all except the burning ship. The boats returned with\r\ndifficulty, and one only could contrive to approach; it was nearly full;\r\nLord Eversham and his daughter advanced to the deck\u2019s edge to get in.\r\n\u2018We can only take one of you,\u2019 vociferated the sailors; \u2018keep back on\r\nyour life! throw the girl to us\u2014we will come back for you if we can.\u2019\r\nLord Eversham cast with a strong arm his daughter, who had now entirely\r\nlost her self-possession, into the boat; she was alive again in a\r\nminute; she called to her father, held out her arms to him, and would\r\nhave thrown herself into the sea, but was held back by the sailors.\r\nMeanwhile Lord Eversham, feeling that no boat could again approach the\r\nlost vessel, contrived to heave a spar overboard, and threw himself into\r\nthe sea, clinging to it. The boat, tossed by the huge waves, with\r\ndifficulty made its way to the frigate; and as it rose from the trough\r\nof the sea, Clarice saw her father struggling with his fate\u2014battling\r\nwith the death that at last became the victor; the spar floated by, his\r\narms had fallen from it; were those his pallid features? She neither\r\nwept nor fainted, but her limbs grew rigid, her face colourless, and she\r\nwas lifted as a log on to the deck of the frigate.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe captain allowed that on her homeward voyage the people had rather a\r\nhorror of her, as having caused her father\u2019s death; her own servants had\r\nperished, few people remembered who she was; but they talked together\r\nwith no careful voices as they passed her, and a hundred times she must\r\nhave heard herself accused of having destroyed her parent. She spoke to\r\nno one, or only in brief reply when addressed; to avoid the rough\r\nremonstrances of those around, she appeared at table, ate as well as she\r\ncould; but there was a settled wretchedness in her face that never\r\nchanged. When they landed at Liverpool, the captain conducted her to an\r\nhotel; he left her, meaning to return, but an opportunity of sailing\r\nthat night for the Downs occurred, of which he availed himself, without\r\nagain visiting her. He knew, he said, and truly, that she was in her\r\nnative country, where she had but to write a letter to gather crowds of\r\nfriends about her; and where can greater civility be found than at an\r\nEnglish hotel, if it is known that you are perfectly able to pay your\r\nbill?\r\n\r\n\u201cThis was all that Mr. Elmore could learn, and it took many months to\r\ngather together these few particulars. He went to the hotel at\r\nLiverpool. It seemed that as soon as there appeared some hope of rescue\r\nfrom the frigate, Lord Eversham had given his pocket-book to his\r\ndaughter\u2019s care, containing bills on a banking-house at Liverpool to the\r\namount of a few hundred pounds. On the second day after Clarice\u2019s\r\narrival there, she had sent for the master of the hotel, and showed him\r\nthese. He got the cash for her; and the next day she quitted Liverpool\r\nin a little coasting vessel. In vain Lewis endeavoured to trace her.\r\nApparently she had crossed to Ireland; but whatever she had done,\r\nwherever she had gone, she had taken infinite pains to conceal herself,\r\nand all due was speedily lost.\r\n\r\n\u201cLewis had not yet despaired; he was even now perpetually making\r\njourneys, sending emissaries, employing every possible means for her\r\ndiscovery. From the moment he told me this story, we talked of nothing\r\nelse. I became deeply interested, and we ceaselessly discussed the\r\nprobabilities of the case, and where she might be concealed. That she\r\ndid not meditate suicide was evident from her having possessed herself\r\nof money; yet, unused to the world, young, lovely, and inexperienced,\r\nwhat could be her plan? What might not have been her fate?\r\n\r\n\u201cMeanwhile I continued for nearly three months confined by the fracture\r\nof my limb; before the lapse of that time, I had begun to crawl about\r\nthe ground, and now I considered myself as nearly recovered. It had been\r\nsettled that I should not return to Eton, but be entered at Oxford; and\r\nthis leap from boyhood to man\u2019s estate elated me considerably. Yet still\r\nI thought of my poor Ellen, and was angry at her obstinate silence. Once\r\nor twice I had, disobeying her command, written to her, mentioning my\r\naccident, and the kind attentions of Mr. Elmore. Still she wrote not;\r\nand I began to fear that her illness might have had a fatal termination.\r\nShe had made me vow so solemnly never to mention her name, never to\r\ninquire about her during my absence, that, considering obedience the\r\nfirst duty of a young inexperienced boy to one older than himself, I\r\nresisted each suggestion of my affection or my fears to transgress her\r\norders.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now spring came, with its gift of opening buds, odoriferous\r\nflowers, and sunny genial days. I returned home, and found my family on\r\nthe eve of their departure for London; my long confinement had weakened\r\nme; it was deemed inadvisable for me to encounter the bad air and\r\nfatigues of the metropolis, and I remained to rusticate. I rode and\r\nhunted, and thought of Ellen; missing the excitement of her\r\nconversation, and feeling a vacancy in my heart which she had filled. I\r\nbegan to think of riding across the country from Shropshire to Berks for\r\nthe purpose of seeing her. The whole landscape haunted my\r\nimagination\u2014the fields round Eton\u2014the silver Thames\u2014the majestic\r\nforest\u2014this lovely scene of Virginia Water\u2014the heath and her desolate\r\ncottage\u2014she herself pale, slightly bending from weakness of health,\r\nawakening from dark abstraction to bestow on me a kind smile of welcome.\r\nIt grew into a passionate desire of my heart to behold her, to cheer her\r\nas I might by my affectionate attentions, to hear her, and to hang upon\r\nher accents of inconsolable despair as if it had been celestial harmony.\r\nAs I meditated on these things, a voice seemed for ever to repeat, Now\r\ngo, or it will be too late; while another yet more mournful tone\r\nresponded, You can never see her more!\r\n\r\n\u201cI was occupied by these thoughts, as, on a summer moonlight night, I\r\nloitered in the shrubbery, unable to quit a scene of entrancing beauty,\r\nwhen I was startled at hearing myself called by Mr. Elmore. He came on\r\nhis way to the coast; he had received a letter from Ireland, which made\r\nhim think that Miss Eversham was residing near Enniscorthy,\u2014a strange\r\nplace for her to select, but as concealment was evidently her object,\r\nnot an improbable one. Yet his hopes were not high; on the contrary, he\r\nperformed this journey more from the resolve to leave nothing undone,\r\nthan in expectation of a happy result. He asked me if I would accompany\r\nhim; I was delighted with the offer, and we departed together on the\r\nfollowing morning.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe arrived at Milford Haven, where we were to take our passage. The\r\npacket was to sail early in the morning\u2014we walked on the beach, and\r\nbeguiled the time by talk. I had never mentioned Ellen to Lewis; I felt\r\nnow strongly inclined to break my vow, and to relate my whole adventure\r\nwith her; but restrained myself, and we spoke only of the unhappy\r\nClarice\u2014of the despair that must have been hers, of her remorse and\r\nunavailing regret.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe retired to rest; and early in the morning I was called to prepare\r\nfor going on board. I got ready, and then knocked at Lewis\u2019 door; he\r\nadmitted me, for he was dressed, though a few of his things were still\r\nunpacked, and scattered about the room. The morocco case of a miniature\r\nwas on his table; I took it up. \u2018Did I never show you that?\u2019 said\r\nElmore; \u2018poor dear Clarice! she was very happy when that was painted!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI opened it;\u2014rich, luxuriant curls clustered on her brow and the\r\nsnow-white throat; there was a light zephyr appearance in the figure; an\r\nexpression of unalloyed exuberant happiness in the countenance; but\r\nthose large dove\u2019s eyes, the innocence that dwelt on her mouth, could\r\nnot be mistaken, and the name of Ellen Burnet burst from my lips.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was no doubt: why had I ever doubted? the thing was so plain! Who\r\nbut the survivor of such a parent, and she the apparent cause of his\r\ndeath, could be so miserable as Ellen? A torrent of explanation\r\nfollowed, and a thousand minute circumstances, forgotten before, now\r\nassured us that my sad hermitess was the beloved of Elmore. No more sea\r\nvoyage\u2014not a second of delay\u2014our chaise, the horses\u2019 heads tamed to the\r\neast, rolled on with lightning rapidity, yet far too slowly to satisfy\r\nour impatience. It was not until we arrived at Worcester that the tide\r\nof expectation, flowing all one way, ebbed. Suddenly, even while I was\r\ntelling Elmore some anecdote to prove that, in spite of all, she would\r\nbe accessible to consolation, I remembered her ill-health and my fears.\r\nLewis saw the change my countenance underwent; for some time I could not\r\ncommand my voice; and when at last I spoke, my gloomy anticipations\r\npassed like an electric shock into my friend\u2019s soul.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen we arrived at Oxford we halted for an hour or two, unable to\r\nproceed; yet we did not converse on the subject so near our hearts, nor\r\nuntil we arrived in sight of Windsor did a word pass between us; then\r\nElmore said, \u2018To-morrow morning, dear Neville, you shall visit Clarice;\r\nwe must not be too precipitate.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe morrow came. I arose with that intolerable weight at my breast,\r\nwhich it is grief\u2019s worst heritage to feel. A sunny day it was; yet the\r\natmosphere looked black to me; my heart was dead within me. We sat at\r\nthe breakfast-table, but neither ate, and after some restless\r\nindecision, we left our inn, and (to protract the interval) walked to\r\nBishopsgate. Our conversation belied our feelings: we spoke as if we\r\nexpected all to be well; we felt that there was no hope. We crossed the\r\nheath along the accustomed path. On one side was the luxuriant foliage\r\nof the forest, on the other the widespread moor; her cottage was\r\nsituated at one extremity, and could hardly be distinguished, until we\r\nshould arrive close to it. When we drew near, Lewis bade me go on alone;\r\nhe would wait my return. I obeyed, and reluctantly approached the\r\nconfirmation of my fears. At length it stood before me, the lonely cot\r\nand desolate garden; the unfastened wicket swung in the breeze; every\r\nshutter was closed.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo stand motionless and gaze on these symbols of my worst forebodings\r\nwas all that I could do. My heart seemed to me to call aloud for\r\nEllen,\u2014for such was she to me,\u2014her other name might be a fiction\u2014but\r\nsilent as her own life-deserted lips were mine. Lewis grew impatient,\r\nand advanced. My stay had occasioned a transient ray of hope to enter\r\nhis mind; it vanished when he saw me and _her_ deserted dwelling. Slowly\r\nwe turned away, and were directing our steps back again, when my name\r\nwas called by a child. A little girl came running across some fields\r\ntowards us, whom at last I recognised as having seen before with Ellen.\r\n\u2018Mr. Neville, there is a letter for you!\u2019 cried the child. \u2018A letter;\r\nwhere?\u2014who?\u2019 \u2018The lady left a letter for you. You must go to Old\r\nWindsor, to Mr. Cooke\u2019s; he has got it for you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cShe had left a letter: was she then departed on an earthly journey? \u2018I\r\nwill go for it immediately. Mr. Cooke! Old Windsor! where shall I find\r\nhim? who is he?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, sir, everybody knows him,\u2019 said the child; \u2018he lives close to the\r\nchurchyard; he is the sexton. After the burial, Nancy gave him the\r\nletter to take care of.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHad we hoped? had we for a moment indulged the expectation of ever\r\nagain seeing our miserable friend? Never! O never! Our hearts had told\r\nus that the sufferer was at peace\u2014the unhappy orphan with her father in\r\nthe abode of spirits! Why, then, were we here? Why had a smile dwelt on\r\nour lips, now wreathed into the expression of anguish? Our full hearts\r\ndemanded one consolation\u2014to weep upon her grave; her sole link now with\r\nus, her mourners. There at last my boy\u2019s grief found vent in tears, in\r\nlamentation. You saw the spot; the grassy mound rests lightly on the\r\nbosom of fair Clarice, of my own poor Ellen. Stretched upon this,\r\nkissing the scarcely springing turf; for many hours no thought visited\r\nme but the wretched one, that she had lived, and was lost to me for\r\never!\r\n\r\n\u201cIf Lewis had ever doubted the identity of my friend with her he loved,\r\nthe letter put into our hands undeceived him; the handwriting was Miss\r\nEversham\u2019s, it was directed to me, and contained words like these:\u2014\r\n\r\n                                                           \u201c\u2018_April 11_.\r\n\r\n    \u201c\u2018I have vowed never to mention certain beloved names, never to\r\n    communicate with beings who cherished me once, to whom my deepest\r\n    gratitude is due; and, as well as poor bankrupt can, is paid.\r\n    Perhaps it is a mere prevarication to write to you, dear Horace,\r\n    concerning them; but Heaven pardon me! my disrobed spirit would not\r\n    repose, I fear, if I did not thus imperfectly bid them a last\r\n    farewell.\r\n\r\n    \u201c\u2018You know him, Neville; and know that he for ever laments her whom\r\n    he has lost. Describe your poor Ellen to him, and he will speedily\r\n    see that _she_ died on the waves of the murderous Atlantic. Ellen\r\n    had nothing in common with _her_, save love for, and interest in\r\n    him. Tell him it had been well for him, perhaps, to have united\r\n    himself to the child of prosperity, the nursling of deep love; but\r\n    it had been destruction, even could he have meditated such an act,\r\n    to wed the parrici\u2014.\r\n\r\n    \u201c\u2018I will not write that word. Sickness and near death have taken the\r\n    sting from my despair. The agony of woe which you witnessed is\r\n    melted into tender affliction and pious hope. I am not miserable\r\n    now. Now! When you read these words, the hand that writes, the eye\r\n    that sees, will be a little dust, becoming one with the earth around\r\n    it. You, perhaps he, will visit my quiet retreat, bestow a few tears\r\n    on my fate, but let them be secret; they may make green my grave,\r\n    but do not let a misplaced feeling adorn it with any other tribute.\r\n    It is my last request; let no stone, no name, mark that spot.\r\n\r\n    \u201c\u2018Farewell, dear Horace! Farewell to one other whom I may not name.\r\n    May the God to whom I am about to resign my spirit in confidence and\r\n    hope, bless your earthly career! Blindly, perhaps, you will regret\r\n    me for your own sakes; but for mine, you will be grateful to the\r\n    Providence which has snapt the heavy chain binding me to unutterable\r\n    sorrow, and which permits me from my lowly grass-grown tomb to say\r\n    to you, I am at peace.\r\n\r\n                                                              \u201c\u2018ELLEN.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI.\r\n\r\n                           _THE FALSE RHYME._\r\n\r\n                 \u201cCome, tell me where the maid is found\r\n                    Whose heart can love without deceit,\r\n                  And I will range the world around\r\n                    To sigh one moment at her feet.\u201d\r\n                                \u2014MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nON a fine July day, the fair Margaret, Queen of Navarre, then on a visit\r\nto her royal brother, had arranged a rural feast for the morning\r\nfollowing, which Francis declined attending. He was melancholy; and the\r\ncause was said to be some lover\u2019s quarrel with a favourite dame. The\r\nmorrow came, and dark rain and murky clouds destroyed at once the\r\nschemes of the courtly throng. Margaret was angry, and she grew weary:\r\nher only hope for amusement was in Francis, and he had shut himself\r\nup,\u2014an excellent reason why she should the more desire to see him. She\r\nentered his apartment: he was standing at the casement, against which\r\nthe noisy shower beat, writing with a diamond on the glass. Two\r\nbeautiful dogs were his sole companions. As Queen Margaret entered, he\r\nhastily let down the silken curtain before the window, and looked a\r\nlittle confused.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat treason is this, my liege,\u201d said the queen, \u201cwhich crimsons your\r\ncheek? I must see the same.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is treason,\u201d replied the king, \u201cand therefore, sweet sister, thou\r\nmayest not see it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis the more excited Margaret\u2019s curiosity, and a playful contest\r\nensued. Francis at last yielded: he threw himself on a huge high-backed\r\nsettee; and as the lady drew back the curtain with an arch smile, he\r\ngrew grave and sentimental, as he reflected on the cause which had\r\ninspired his libel against all womankind.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have we here?\u201d cried Margaret; \u201cnay, this is l\u00ease majest\u00e9\u2014\r\n\r\n                        \u201c\u2018Souvent femme varie,\r\n                          Bien fou qui s\u2019y fie!\u2019\r\n\r\nVery little change would greatly amend your couplet:\u2014would it not run\r\nbetter thus\u2014\r\n\r\n                       \u201c\u2018Souvent homme varie,\r\n                         Bien folle qui s\u2019y fie?\u2019\r\n\r\nI could tell you twenty stories of man\u2019s inconstancy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will be content with one true tale of woman\u2019s fidelity,\u201d said Francis\r\ndrily; \u201cbut do not provoke me. I would fain be at peace with the soft\r\nMutabilities, for thy dear sake.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI defy your grace,\u201d replied Margaret rashly, \u201cto instance the falsehood\r\nof one noble and well-reputed dame.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot even Emilie de Lagny?\u201d asked the king.\r\n\r\nThis was a sore subject for the queen. Emilie had been brought up in her\r\nown household, the most beautiful and the most virtuous of her maids of\r\nhonour. She had long loved the Sire de Lagny, and their nuptials were\r\ncelebrated with rejoicings but little ominous of the result. De Lagny\r\nwas accused but a year after of traitorously yielding to the emperor a\r\nfortress under his command, and he was condemned to perpetual\r\nimprisonment. For some time Emilie seemed inconsolable, often visiting\r\nthe miserable dungeon of her husband, and suffering on her return, from\r\nwitnessing his wretchedness, such paroxysms of grief as threatened her\r\nlife. Suddenly, in the midst of her sorrow, she disappeared; and inquiry\r\nonly divulged the disgraceful fact, that she had escaped from France,\r\nbearing her jewels with her, and accompanied by her page, Robinet\r\nLeroux. It was whispered that, during their journey, the lady and the\r\nstripling often occupied one chamber; and Margaret, enraged at these\r\ndiscoveries, commanded that no further quest should be made for her lost\r\nfavourite.\r\n\r\nTaunted now by her brother, she defended Emilie, declaring that she\r\nbelieved her to be guiltless, even going so far as to boast that within\r\na month she would bring proof of her innocence.\r\n\r\n\u201cRobinet was a pretty boy,\u201d said Francis, laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us make a bet,\u201d cried Margaret: \u201cif I lose, I will bear this vile\r\nrhyme of thine as a motto to my shame to my grave; if I win\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI will break my window, and grant thee whatever boon thou askest.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe result of this bet was long sung by troubadour and minstrel. The\r\nqueen employed a hundred emissaries,\u2014published rewards for any\r\nintelligence of Emilie,\u2014all in vain. The month was expiring, and\r\nMargaret would have given many bright jewels to redeem her word. On the\r\neve of the fatal day, the jailor of the prison in which the Sire de\r\nLagny was confined sought an audience of the queen; he brought her a\r\nmessage from the knight to say, that if the Lady Margaret would ask his\r\npardon as her boon, and obtain from her royal brother that he might be\r\nbrought before him, her bet was won. Fair Margaret was very joyful, and\r\nreadily made the desired promise. Francis was unwilling to see his false\r\nservant, but he was in high good-humour, for a cavalier had that morning\r\nbrought intelligence of a victory over the Imperialists. The messenger\r\nhimself was lauded in the despatches as the most fearless and bravest\r\nknight in France. The king loaded him with presents, only regretting\r\nthat a vow prevented the soldier from raising his visor or declaring his\r\nname.\r\n\r\nThat same evening as the setting sun shone on the lattice on which the\r\nungallant rhyme was traced, Francis reposed on the same settee, and the\r\nbeautiful Queen of Navarre, with triumph in her bright eyes, sat beside\r\nhim. Attended by guards, the prisoner was brought in: his frame was\r\nattenuated by privation, and he walked with tottering steps. He knelt at\r\nthe feet of Francis, and uncovered his head; a quantity of rich golden\r\nhair then escaping, fell over the sunken cheeks and pallid brow of the\r\nsuppliant.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have treason here!\u201d cried the king. \u201cSir jailor, where is your\r\nprisoner!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSire, blame him not,\u201d said the soft faltering voice of Emilie; \u201cwiser\r\nmen than he have been deceived by woman. My dear lord was guiltless of\r\nthe crime for which he suffered. There was but one mode to save him:\u2014I\r\nassumed his chains\u2014he escaped with poor Robinet Leroux in my attire\u2014he\r\njoined your army: the young and gallant cavalier who delivered the\r\ndespatches to your grace, whom you overwhelmed with honours and reward,\r\nis my own Enguerrard de Lagny. I waited but for his arrival with\r\ntestimonials of his innocence, to declare myself to my lady, the queen.\r\nHas she not won her bet! And the boon she asks\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cIs de Lagny\u2019s pardon,\u201d said Margaret, as she also knelt to the king.\r\n\u201cSpare your faithful vassal, sire, and reward this lady\u2019s truth.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrancis first broke the false-speaking window, then he raised the ladies\r\nfrom their supplicatory posture.\r\n\r\nIn the tournament given to celebrate this \u201cTriumph of Ladies,\u201d the Sire\r\nde Lagny bore off every prize; and surely there was more loveliness in\r\nEmilie\u2019s faded cheek\u2014more grace in her emaciated form, type as they were\r\nof truest affection\u2014than in the prouder bearing and fresher complexion\r\nof the most brilliant beauty in attendance on the courtly festival.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII.\r\n\r\n          _A TALE OF THE PASSIONS; OR, THE DEATH OF DESPINA._\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER the death of Manfred, King of Naples, the Ghibellines lost their\r\nascendency throughout Italy. The exiled Guelphs returned to their native\r\ncities; and, not contented with resuming the reins of government, they\r\nprosecuted their triumph until the Ghibellines in their turn were\r\nobliged to fly, and to mourn in banishment over the violent party spirit\r\nwhich had before occasioned their bloody victories, and now their\r\nirretrievable defeat. After an obstinate contest, the Florentine\r\nGhibellines were forced to quit their native town; their estates were\r\nconfiscated; their attempts to reinstate themselves frustrated; and\r\nreceding from castle to castle, they at length took refuge in Lucca, and\r\nawaited with impatience the arrival of Corradino from Germany, through\r\nwhose influence they hoped again to establish the Imperial supremacy.\r\n\r\nThe first of May was ever a day of rejoicing and festivity at Florence.\r\nThe youth of both sexes, and of all ranks, paraded the streets, crowned\r\nwith flowers, and singing the canzonets of the day. In the evening they\r\nassembled in the _Piazza del Duomo_, and spent the hours in dancing. The\r\n_Carroccio_ was led through the principal streets, the ringing of its\r\nbell drowned in the peals that rang from every belfry in the city, and\r\nin the music of fifes and drums which made a part of the procession that\r\nfollowed it. The triumph of the reigning party in Florence caused them\r\nto celebrate the anniversary of the first of May, 1268, with peculiar\r\nsplendour. They had indeed hoped that Charles d\u2019Anjou, King of Naples,\r\nthe head of the Guelphs in Italy, and then _Vicare_ (President) of their\r\nrepublic, would have been there to adorn the festival by his presence.\r\nBut the expectation of Corradino had caused the greater part of his\r\nnewly-conquered and oppressed kingdom to revolt, and he had hastily\r\nquitted Tuscany to secure by his presence those conquests of which his\r\navarice and cruelty endangered the loss. But although Charles somewhat\r\nfeared the approaching contest with Corradino, the Florentine Guelphs,\r\nnewly reinstated in their city and possessions, did not permit a fear to\r\ncloud their triumph. The principal families vied with each other in the\r\ndisplay of their magnificence during the festival. The knights followed\r\nthe _Carroccio_ on horseback, and the windows were filled with ladies\r\nwho leant upon gold-inwoven carpets, while their own dresses, at once\r\nsimple and elegant, their only ornaments, flowers, contrasted with the\r\nglittering tapestry and the brilliant colours of the flags of the\r\nvarious communities. The whole population of Florence poured into the\r\nprincipal streets, and none were left at home, except the decrepit and\r\nsick, unless it were some discontented Ghibelline, whose fear, poverty,\r\nor avarice had caused him to conceal his party when it had been banished\r\nfrom the city.\r\n\r\nIt was not the feeling of discontent which prevented Monna Gegia de\u2019\r\nBecari from being among the first of the revellers; and she looked\r\nangrily on what she called her \u201cGhibelline leg,\u201d which fixed her to her\r\nchair on such a day of triumph. The sun shone in all its glory in an\r\nunclouded sky, and caused the fair Florentines to draw their _fazioles_\r\n(veils) over their dark eyes, and to bereave the youth of those beams\r\nmore vivifying than the sun\u2019s rays. The same sun poured its full light\r\ninto the lonely apartment of Monna Gegia, and almost extinguished the\r\nfire which was lighted in the middle of the room, over which hung the\r\npot of _minestra_, the dinner of the dame and her husband. But she had\r\ndeserted the fire, and was seated by her window, holding her beads in\r\nher hand, while every now and then she peeped from her lattice (five\r\nstoreys high) into the narrow lane below; but no creature passed. She\r\nlooked at the opposite window; a cat slept there beside a pot of\r\nheliotrope, but no human being was heard or seen,\u2014they had all gone to\r\nthe _Piazza del Duomo_.\r\n\r\nMonna Gegia was an old woman, and her dress of green _calrasio_ (stuff)\r\nshowed that she belonged to one of the _Arli Minori_ (working classes).\r\nHer head was covered by a red kerchief, which, folded triangularly, hung\r\nloosely over it; her grey hairs were combed back from her high and\r\nwrinkled brow. The quickness of her eye spoke the activity of her mind,\r\nand the slight irritability that lingered about the corners of her lips\r\nmight be occasioned by the continual war maintained between her bodily\r\nand mental faculties. \u201cNow, by St. John!\u201d she said, \u201cI would give my\r\ngold cross to make one of them; though by giving that I should appear on\r\na _festa_, without that which no _festa_ yet ever found me wanting.\u201d And\r\nas she spoke she looked with great complacency on a large but thin gold\r\ncross which was tied round her withered neck by a ribbon, once black,\r\nnow of a rusty brown. \u201cMethinks this leg of mine is bewitched; and it\r\nmay well be that my Ghibelline husband has used the black art to hinder\r\nme from following the _Carroccio_ with the best of them.\u201d\u2014A slight\r\nsound, as of footsteps in the street far below, interrupted the good\r\nwoman\u2019s soliloquy.\u2014\u201cPerhaps it is Monna Lisabetta, or Messer Giani dei\r\nAgli, the weaver, who mounted the breach first when the castle of\r\nPagibonzi was taken.\u201d\u2014She looked down, but could see no one, and was\r\nabout to relapse into her old train of thoughts, when her attention was\r\nagain attracted by the sound of steps ascending the stairs: they were\r\nslow and heavy, but she did not doubt who her visitant was when a key\r\nwas applied to the hole of the door; the latch was lifted up, and a\r\nmoment after, with an unassured mien and downcast eyes, her husband\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nHe was a short, stunted man, more than sixty years of age; his shoulders\r\nwere broad and high; his lank hair was still coal-black; his brows were\r\noverhanging and bushy; his eyes black and quick; his lips as it were\r\ncontradicted the sternness of the upper part of his face, for their\r\ngentle curve betokened even delicacy of sentiment, and his smile was\r\ninexpressibly sweet. He had on a low-crowned, red cloth cap, which he\r\ndrew over his eyes, and, seating himself on a low bench by the fire, he\r\nheaved a deep sigh. He appeared disinclined to enter into any\r\nconversation, but Monna Gegia was resolved that he should not enjoy his\r\nmelancholy mood uninterrupted.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you been to mass, Cincolo?\u201d she asked, beginning by a question\r\nsufficiently removed from the point she longed to approach.\u2014He shrugged\r\nhis shoulders uneasily, but did not reply.\u2014\u201cYou are too early for your\r\ndinner,\u201d continued Gegia; \u201cdo you not go out again?\u201d\r\n\r\nCincolo answered \u201cNo!\u201d in an accent that denoted his disinclination to\r\nfurther questioning. But this very impatience only served to feed the\r\nspirit of contention that was fermenting in the bosom of Gegia.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are not used,\u201d she said, \u201cto pass your May days under your\r\nchimney.\u201d\u2014No answer.\u2014\u201cWell,\u201d she continued, \u201cif you will not speak, I\r\nhave done!\u201d\u2014meaning that she intended to begin\u2014\u201cbut by that lengthened\r\nface of thine I see that some good news is stirring abroad, and I bless\r\nthe Virgin for it, whatever it may be. Come, tell me what happy tidings\r\nmake thee so woe-begone.\u201d\r\n\r\nCincolo remained silent for awhile, then turning half round, but not\r\nlooking at his wife, he replied, \u201cWhat if old Marzio the lion be dead?\u201d\r\n\r\nGegia turned pale at the idea, but a smile that lurked in the\r\ngood-natured mouth of her husband reassured her.\r\n\r\n\u201cNay, St. John defend us!\u201d she began, \u201cbut that is not true. Old\r\nMarzio\u2019s death would not drive you within these four walls, except it\r\nwere to triumph over your old wife. By the blessing of St. John, not one\r\nof our lions have died since the eve of the battle of Monte Aperto; and\r\nI doubt not that they were poisoned; for Mari, who fed them that night,\r\nwas more than half a Ghibelline in his heart. Besides, the bells are\r\nstill ringing, and the drums still beating, and all would be silent\r\nenough if old Marzio were to die. On the first of May too! Santa\r\nReparata is too good to us to allow such ill-luck;\u2014and she has more\r\nfavour, I trust, in the seventh heaven than all the Ghibelline saints in\r\nyour calendar. No, good Cincolo, Marzio is not dead, nor the Holy\r\nFather, nor Messer Carlo of Naples; but I would bet my gold cross\r\nagainst the wealth of your banished men, that Pisa is taken\u2014or\r\nCorradino\u2014or\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I here! No, Gegia, old as I am, and much as you need my help (and\r\nthat last is why I am here at all), Pisa would not be taken while this\r\nold body could stand in the breach; or Corradino die, till this lazy\r\nblood were colder on the ground than it is in my body. Ask no more\r\nquestions, and do not rouse me: there is no news, no good or ill-luck,\r\nthat I know. But when I saw the Neri, the Pulci, the Buondelmonti, and\r\nthe rest of them, ride like kings through the streets, whose very hands\r\nare hardly dry from the blood of my kindred; when I saw their daughter\r\ncrowned with flowers, and thought how the daughter of Arrigo dei Elisei\r\nwas mourning for her murdered father, with ashes on her head, by the\r\nhearth of a stranger,\u2014my spirit must be more dead than it is if such a\r\nsight did not make me wish to drive among them; and methought I could\r\nscatter their pomp with my awl for a sword. But I remembered thee, and\r\nam here unstained with blood.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat thou wilt never be!\u201d cried Monna Gegia, the colour rising in her\r\nwrinkled cheeks. \u201cSince the battle of Monte Aperto thou hast never been\r\nwell washed of that shed by thee and thy confederates; and how could ye?\r\nfor the Arno has never since run clear of the blood then spilt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd if the sea were red with that blood, still, while there is any of\r\nthe Guelphs\u2019 to spill, I am ready to spill it, were it not for thee.\r\nThou dost well to mention Monte Aperto, and thou wouldst do better to\r\nremember over whom its grass now grows.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPeace, Cincolo; a mother\u2019s heart has more memory in it than thou\r\nthinkest; and I well recollect who spurned me as I knelt, and dragged my\r\nonly child, but sixteen years of age, to die in the cause of that\r\nmisbeliever Manfred. Let us indeed speak no more. Woe was the day when I\r\nmarried thee! but those were happy times when there was neither Guelph\r\nnor Ghibelline;\u2014they will never return.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever,\u2014until, as thou sayest, the Arno run clear of the blood shed on\r\nits banks;\u2014never while I can pierce the heart of a Guelph;\u2014never till\r\nboth parties are cold under one bier.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd thou and I, Cincolo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre two old fools, and shall be more at peace under ground than above\r\nit. Rank Guelph as thou art, I married thee before I was a Ghibelline;\r\nso now I must eat from the same platter with the enemy of Manfred, and\r\nmake shoes for Guelphs, instead of following the fortunes of Dorradino,\r\nand sending them, my battle-axe in my hand, to buy their shoes in\r\nBologna.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHush! hush! good man, talk not so loud of thy party; hearest thou not\r\nthat some one knocks?\u201d\r\n\r\nCincolo went to open the door with the air of a man who thinks himself\r\nill-used at being interrupted in his discourse, and is disposed to be\r\nangry with the intruder, however innocent he might be of any intention\r\nof breaking in upon his eloquent complaint. The appearance of his\r\nvisitor calmed his indignant feelings. He was a youth whose countenance\r\nand person showed that he could not be more than sixteen; but there was\r\na self-possession in his demeanour, and a dignity in his physiognomy,\r\nthat belonged to a more advanced age. His figure was slight, and his\r\ncountenance, though beautiful, was pale as monumental marble; the thick\r\nand curling locks of his chestnut hair clustered over his brow and round\r\nhis fair throat; his cap was drawn far down on his forehead. Cincolo was\r\nabout to usher him with deference into his humble room, but the youth\r\nstayed him with his hand, and uttered the words \u201c_Swabia, Cavalieri!_\u201d\r\nthe words by which the Ghibellines were accustomed to recognise each\r\nother. He continued in a low and hurried tone: \u201cYour wife is within?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEnough. Although I am a stranger to you, I come from an old friend.\r\nHarbour me until nightfall; we will then go out, and I will explain to\r\nyou the motives of my intrusion. Call me Ricciardo de\u2019 Rossini of Milan,\r\ntravelling to Rome. I leave Florence this evening.\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving said these words, without giving Cincolo time to reply, he\r\nmotioned that they should enter the room. Monna Gegia had fixed her eyes\r\non the door from the moment he had opened it, with a look of impatient\r\ncuriosity; when she saw the youth enter, she could not refrain from\r\nexclaiming, \u201cGesu Maria!\u201d\u2014so different was he from any one she had\r\nexpected to see.\r\n\r\n\u201cA friend from Milan,\u201d said Cincolo.\r\n\r\n\u201cMore likely from Lucca,\u201d replied his wife, gazing on her visitant. \u201cYou\r\nare doubtless one of the banished men, and you are more daring than wise\r\nto enter this town; however, if you be not a spy, you are safe with me.\u201d\r\n\r\nRicciardo smiled and thanked her in a low, sweet voice. \u201cIf you do not\r\nturn me out,\u201d he said, \u201cI shall remain under your roof nearly all the\r\ntime I remain in Florence, and I leave it soon after dusk.\u201d\r\n\r\nGegia again gazed on her guest, nor did Cincolo scrutinize him with less\r\ncuriosity. His black cloth tunic reached below his knees, and was\r\nconfined by a black leather girdle at the waist. He had on trousers of\r\ncoarse scarlet stuff, over which were drawn short boots; a cloak of\r\ncommon fox\u2019s fur, unlined, hung from his shoulder. But, although his\r\ndress was thus simple, it was such as was then worn by the young\r\nFlorentine nobility. At that time the Italians were simple in their\r\nprivate habits: the French army led by Charles d\u2019Anjou into Italy, first\r\nintroduced luxury into the palaces of the Cisalpines. Manfred was a\r\nmagnificent prince, but it was his saintly rival who was the author of\r\nthat trifling foppery of dress and ornaments which degrades a nation,\r\nand is a sure precursor of their downfall. But of Ricciardo\u2014his\r\ncountenance had all the regularity of a Grecian head; and his blue eyes,\r\nshaded by very long, dark eyelashes, were soft, yet full of expression.\r\nWhen he looked up, the heavy lids, as it were, unveiled the gentle light\r\nbeneath, and then again closed over them, as shading what was too\r\nbrilliant to behold. His lips expressed the deepest sensibility, and\r\nsomething perhaps of timidity, had not the placid confidence of his\r\ndemeanour forbidden such an idea.\r\n\r\nHis host and hostess were at first silent; but he asked some natural\r\nquestions about the buildings of their city, and by degrees led them\r\ninto discourse. When mid-day struck, Cincolo looked towards his pot of\r\n_minestra_, and Ricciardo followed his look, asked if that was not the\r\ndinner. \u201cYou must entertain me,\u201d he said, \u201cfor I have not eaten to-day.\u201d\r\nA table was drawn near the window, and the _minestra_, poured out into\r\none plate, was placed in the middle of it, a spoon was given to each,\r\nand a jug of wine filled from a barrel. Ricciardo looked at the two old\r\npeople, and seemed somewhat to smile at the idea of eating from the same\r\nplate with them; he ate, however, though sparingly, and drank of the\r\nwine, though with still greater moderation. Cincolo, however, under\r\npretence of serving his guest, filled his jug a second time, and was\r\nabout to rise for the third measure, when Ricciardo, placing his small\r\nwhite hand on his arm, said, \u201cAre you a German, my friend, that you\r\ncease not after so many draughts? I have heard that you Florentines were\r\na sober people.\u201d\r\n\r\nCincolo was not much pleased with this reproof, but he felt that it was\r\ntimely; so, conceding the point, he sat down again, and, somewhat heated\r\nwith what he had already drank, he asked his guest the news from\r\nGermany, and what hopes for the good cause? Gegia bridled at these\r\nwords, and Ricciardo replied, \u201cMany reports are abroad, and high hopes\r\nentertained, especially in the north of Italy, for the success of our\r\nexpedition. Corradino is arrived at Genoa, and it is hoped that,\r\nalthough the ranks of his army were much thinned by the desertion of his\r\nGerman troops, they will be quickly filled by Italians, braver and truer\r\nthan those foreigners, who, strangers to our soil, could not fight for\r\nhis cause with our ardour?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how does he bear himself?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs beseems one of the house of Swabia, and the nephew of Manfred. He is\r\ninexperienced and young. He is not more than sixteen. His mother would\r\nhardly consent to this expedition, but wept at the fear of all he might\r\nendure; for he has been nursed in every luxury, and habituated to the\r\ntender care of a woman, who, although she be a princess, has waited on\r\nhim with anxious solicitude. But Corradino is of good heart; docile, but\r\ncourageous; obedient to his wiser friends, gentle to his inferiors, but\r\nnoble of soul, the spirit of Manfred seems to animate his unfolding\r\nmind; and surely, if that glorious prince now enjoys the reward of his\r\nsurpassing virtues, he looks down with joy and approbation on him who\r\nis, I trust, destined to fill his throne.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm with which Ricciardo spoke suffused his pale countenance\r\nwith a slight blush, while his eyes swam in the lustre of the dew that\r\nfilled them. Gegia was little pleased with this harangue, but curiosity\r\nkept her silent, while her husband proceeded to question his guest. \u201cYou\r\nseem to be well acquainted with Corradino?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw him at Milan, and was closely connected with his most intimate\r\nfriend there. As I have said, he has arrived at Genoa, and perhaps has\r\neven now landed at Pisa; he will find many friends in that town. Every\r\nman there will be his friend; but during his journey southward he will\r\nhave to contend with our Florentine army, commanded by the Marshals of\r\nthe usurper Charles, and assisted by his troops. Charles himself has\r\nleft us, and is gone to Naples to prepare for this war. But he is\r\ndetested there, as a tyrant and a robber, and Corradino will be received\r\nin the Regno as a saviour; so that if he once surmount the obstacles\r\nwhich oppose his entrance, I do not doubt his success, and trust that he\r\nwill be crowned within a month at Rome, and the week after sit on the\r\nthrone of his ancestors in Naples.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who will crown him?\u201d cried Gegia, unable to contain herself. \u201cItaly\r\ncontains no heretic base enough to do such a deed, unless it be a Jew;\r\nor he send to Constantinople for a Greek, or to Egypt for a Mohammedan.\r\nCursed may the race of the Frederics ever be! Thrice cursed one who has\r\naffinity to the miscreant Manfred! And little do you please me, young\r\nman, by holding such discourse in my house.\u201d\r\n\r\nCincolo looked at Ricciardo, as if he feared that so violent a partisan\r\nfor the house of Swabia would be irritated at his wife\u2019s attack; but he\r\nwas looking on the aged woman with a regard of the most serene\r\nbenignity; no contempt even was mingled with the gentle smile that\r\nplayed round his lips. \u201cI will restrain myself,\u201d he said, and, turning\r\nto Cincolo, he conversed on more general subjects, describing the\r\nvarious cities of Italy that he had visited; discussing their modes of\r\ngovernment, and relating anecdotes concerning their inhabitants, with an\r\nair of experience that, contrasted with his youthful appearance, greatly\r\nimpressed Cincolo, who looked on him at once with admiration and\r\nrespect. Evening came on. The sound of bells died away after the _Ave\r\nMaria_ had ceased to ring, but the distant sound of music was wafted to\r\nthem by the night air. Ricciardo was about to address Cincolo, when a\r\nknocking at the gate interrupted him. It was Buzeccha, the Saracen, a\r\nfamous chess-player, who was used to parade about under the colonnades\r\nof the Duomo, and challenge the young nobles to play; and sometimes much\r\nstress was laid on these games, and the gain and loss became the talk of\r\nFlorence. Buzeccha was a tall and ungainly man, with all that\r\ngood-natured consequence of manner which the fame he had acquired by his\r\nproficiency in so trifling a science, and the familiarity with which he\r\nwas permitted to treat those superior to him in rank, who were pleased\r\nto measure their forces with him, might well bestow. He was beginning\r\nwith \u201cEh, Messere!\u201d when perceiving Ricciardo, he cried, \u201cWho have we\r\nhere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA friend to good men,\u201d replied Ricciardo, smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, by Mahomet, thou art my friend, my stripling.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThou shouldst be a Saracen, by thy speech?\u201d said Ricciardo.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd through the help of the Prophet, so am I. One who in Manfred\u2019s\r\ntime\u2014but no more of that. We won\u2019t talk of Manfred, eh, Monna Gegia? I\r\nam Buzeccha, the chess-player, at your service, Messer lo Forestiere.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe introduction thus made, they began to talk of the procession of the\r\nday. After a while, Buzeccha introduced his favourite subject of\r\nchess-playing; he recounted some wonderfully good strokes he had\r\nachieved, and related to Ricciardo how before the _Palagio del Popolo_,\r\nin the presence of Count Guido Novelle de\u2019 Giudi, then _Vicare_ of the\r\ncity, he had played an hour at three chess-boards with three of the best\r\nchess-players in Florence, playing two by memory and one by sight; and\r\nout of three games which made the board, he had won two. This account\r\nwas wound up by a proposal to play with his host. \u201cThou art a\r\nhard-headed fellow, Cincolo, and make better play than the nobles. I\r\nwould swear that thou thinkest of chess only as thou cobblest thy shoes;\r\nevery hole of your awl is a square of the board, every stitch a move,\r\nand a finished pair paid for checkmate to your adversary; eh, Cincolo?\r\nBring out the field of battle, man.\u201d\r\n\r\nRicciardo interposed: \u201cI leave Florence in two hours, and before I go,\r\nMesser Cincolo promised to conduct me to the _Piazza del Duomo_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPlenty of time, good youth,\u201d cried Buzeccha, arranging his men; \u201cI only\r\nclaim one game, and my games never last more than a quarter of an hour;\r\nand then we will both escort you, and you shall dance a set into the\r\nbargain with a black-eyed houri, all Nazarine as thou art. So stand out\r\nof my light, good youth, and shut the window, if you have heeding, that\r\nthe torch flare not so.\u201d\r\n\r\nRicciardo seemed amused by the authoritative tone of the chess-player;\r\nhe shut the window and trimmed the torch which, stuck against the wall,\r\nwas the only light they had, and stood by the table, overlooking the\r\ngame. Monna Gegia had replaced the pot for supper, and sat somewhat\r\nuneasily, as if she were displeased that her guest did not talk with\r\nher. Cincolo and Buzeccha were deeply intent on their game, when a knock\r\nwas heard at the door. Cincolo was about to rise and open it, but\r\nRicciardo saying, \u201cDo not disturb yourself,\u201d opened it himself, with the\r\nmanner of one who does humble offices as if ennobling them, so that no\r\none action can be more humble to them than another.\r\n\r\nThe visitant was welcomed by Gegia alone, with \u201cAh! Messer Beppe, this\r\nis kind, on May Day night.\u201d\r\n\r\nRicciardo glanced slightly on him, and then resumed his stand by the\r\nplayers. There was little in Messer Beppe to attract a favourable\r\nregard. He was short, thin, and dry; his face long-drawn and liny; his\r\neyes deep-set and scowling, his lips straight, his nose hooked, and his\r\nhead covered by a close skull-cap, his hair cut close all round. He sat\r\ndown near Gegia, and began to discourse in a whining, servile, voice,\r\ncomplimenting her on her good looks, launching forth into praise of the\r\nmagnificence of certain Guelph Florentines, and concluded by declaring\r\nthat he was hungry and tired.\r\n\r\n\u201cHungry, Beppe?\u201d said Gegia, \u201cthat should have been your first word,\r\nfriend. Cincolo, wilt thou give thy guest to eat? Cincolo, art thou\r\ndeaf? Art thou blind? Dost thou not hear? Wilt thou not see?\u2014Here is\r\nMesser Giuseppe de\u2019 Bosticchi.\u201d\r\n\r\nCincolo slowly, his eyes still fixed on the board, was about to rise.\r\nBut the name of the visitant seemed to have the effect of magic on\r\nRicciardo.\r\n\r\n\u201cBosticchi!\u201d he cried\u2014\u201cGiuseppe Bosticchi! I did not expect to find that\r\nman beneath thy roof, Cincolo, all Guelph as thy wife is; for she also\r\nhas eaten of the bread of Elisei. Farewell! thou wilt find me in the\r\nstreet below; follow me quickly.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was about to go, but Bosticchi placed himself before the door, saying\r\nin a tone whose whine expressed mingled rage and servility, \u201cIn what\r\nhave I offended this young gentleman? Will he not tell me my offence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDare not to stop my way,\u201d cried Ricciardo, passing his hand before his\r\neyes, \u201cnor force me again to look on thee. Begone!\u201d\r\n\r\nCincolo stopped him. \u201cThou art too hasty, and far too passionate, my\r\nnoble guest,\u201d said he; \u201chowever this man may have offended thee, thou\r\nart too violent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cViolent!\u201d cried Ricciardo, almost suffocated by passionate emotion.\r\n\u201cAy, draw thy knife, and show the blood of Arrigo dei Elisei, with which\r\nit is still stained.\u201d\r\n\r\nA dead silence followed. Bosticchi slunk out of the room; Ricciardo hid\r\nhis face in his hands and wept. But soon he calmed his passion, and\r\nsaid: \u201cThis is indeed childish. Pardon me; that man is gone; excuse and\r\nforget my violence. Resume thy game, Cincolo, but conclude it quickly,\r\nfor time gains on us. Hark! an hour of night sounds from the Campanile.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe game is already concluded,\u201d said Buzeccha sorrowfully; \u201cthy cloak\r\noverthrew the best checkmate this head ever planned\u2014so God forgive\r\nthee!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCheckmate!\u201d cried the indignant Cincolo\u2014\u201cCheckmate! and my queen mowing\r\nyou down, rank and file!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us begone!\u201d exclaimed Ricciardo. \u201cMesser Buzeccha, you will play\r\nout your game with Monna Gegia. Cincolo will return ere long.\u201d So taking\r\nhis host by the arm, he drew him out of the room, and descended the\r\nnarrow high stairs with the air of one to whom those stairs were not\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nWhen in the street he slackened his pace, and, first looking round to\r\nassure himself that none overheard their conversation, he addressed\r\nCincolo: \u201cPardon me, my dear friend; I am hasty, and the sight of that\r\nman made every drop of my blood cry aloud in my veins. But I do not come\r\nhere to indulge in private sorrows or private revenge, and my design\r\nought alone to engross me. It is necessary for me to see speedily and\r\nsecretly Messer Guielmo Lostendardo, the Neapolitan commander. I bear a\r\nmessage to him from the Countess Elizabeth, the mother of Corradino, and\r\nI have some hope that its import may induce him to take at least a\r\nneutral part during the impending conflict. I have chosen you, Cincolo,\r\nto aid me in this, for not only you are of that little note in your town\r\nthat you may act for me without attracting observation, but you are\r\nbrave and true, and I may confide to your known worth. Lostendardo\r\nresides at the _Palagio del Governo_. When I enter its doors I am in the\r\nhands of my enemies, and its dungeons may alone know the secret of my\r\ndestiny. I hope better things. But if after two hours I do not appear or\r\nlet you hear of my welfare, carry this packet to Corradino at Pisa. You\r\nwill then learn who I am; and if you feel any indignation at my fate,\r\nlet that feeling attach you still more strongly to the cause for which I\r\nlive and die.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Ricciardo spoke, he still walked on, and Cincolo observed that,\r\nwithout his guidance, he directed his steps towards the _Palagio del\r\nGoverno_.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not understand this,\u201d said the old man. \u201cBy what argument, unless\r\nyou bring one from the other world, do you hope to induce Messer Guielmo\r\nto aid Corradino? He is so bitter an enemy of Manfred, that although\r\nthat prince is dead, yet when he mentions his name he grasps the air as\r\nit were a dagger. I have heard him with horrible imprecations curse the\r\nwhole house of Swabia.\u201d\r\n\r\nA tremor shook the frame of Ricciardo, but he replied, \u201cLostendardo was\r\nonce the firmest support of that house, and the friend of Manfred.\r\nStrange circumstances gave birth in his mind to this unnatural hatred,\r\nand he became a traitor. But, perhaps, now that Manfred is in Paradise,\r\nthe youth, the virtues, and the inexperience of Corradino may inspire\r\nhim with more generous feelings, and reawaken his ancient faith. At\r\nleast I must make this last trial. This cause is too holy, too sacred,\r\nto admit of common forms of reasoning or action. The nephew of Manfred\r\nmust sit upon the throne of his ancestors; and to achieve that I will\r\nendure what I am about to endure.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey entered the palace; Messer Guielmo was carousing in the great hall.\r\n\r\n\u201cBear this ring to him, good Cincolo, and say that I wait. Be speedy,\r\nthat my courage, my life, do not desert me at the moment of trial.\u201d\r\n\r\nCincolo, casting one more inquisitive glance on his extraordinary\r\ncompanion, obeyed his orders, while the youth leant against one of the\r\npillars of the court and passionately cast up his eyes to the clear\r\nfirmament.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, ye stars!\u201d he cried in a smothered voice, \u201cye are eternal; let my\r\npurpose, my will, be as constant as ye!\u201d\r\n\r\nThen, more calm, he folded his arms in his cloak, and with strong inward\r\nstruggle endeavoured to repress his emotion. Several servants approached\r\nhim, and bade him follow them. Again he looked at the sky and said,\r\n\u201cManfred,\u201d and then he walked on with slow but firm steps. They led him\r\nthrough several halls and corridors to a large apartment hung with\r\ntapestry, and well lighted by numerous torches; the marble of the floor\r\nreflected their glare, and the arched roof echoed the footsteps of one\r\nwho paced the apartment as Ricciardo entered. It was Lostendardo. He\r\nmade a sign that the servants should retire; the heavy door closed\r\nbehind them, and Ricciardo stood alone with Messer Guielmo; his\r\ncountenance pale but composed, his eyes cast down as in expectation, not\r\nin fear; and but for the convulsive motion of his lips, you would have\r\nguessed that every faculty was almost suspended by intense agitation.\r\n\r\nLostendardo approached. He was a man in the prime of life, tall and\r\nathletic; he seemed capable with a single exertion to crush the frail\r\nbeing of Ricciardo. Every feature of his countenance spoke of the\r\nstruggle of passions, and the terrible egotism of one who would\r\nsacrifice even himself to the establishment of his will: his black\r\neyebrows were scattered, his grey eyes deep-set and scowling, his look\r\nat once stern and haggard. A smile seemed never to have disturbed the\r\nsettled scorn which his lips expressed; his high forehead, already\r\nbecoming bald, was marked by a thousand contradictory lines. His voice\r\nwas studiously restrained as he said: \u201cWherefore do you bring that\r\nring?\u201d\r\n\r\nRicciardo looked up and met his eye, which glanced fire as he exclaimed,\r\n\u201cDespina!\u201d\u2014He seized her hand with a giant\u2019s grasp: \u201cI have prayed for\r\nthis night and day, and thou art now here! Nay, do not struggle; you are\r\nmine; for by my salvation I swear that thou shalt never again escape\r\nme.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespina replied calmly: \u201cThou mayest well believe that in thus placing\r\nmyself in thy power I do not dread any injury thou canst inflict upon\r\nme, or I were not here. I do not fear thee, for I do not fear death.\r\nLoosen then thy hold, and listen to me. I come in the name of those\r\nvirtues that were once thine; I come in the name of all noble sentiment,\r\ngenerosity, and ancient faith, and I trust that in listening to me your\r\nheroic nature will second my voice, and that Lostendardo will no longer\r\nrank with those whom the good and great never name but to condemn.\u201d\r\n\r\nLostendardo appeared to attend little to what she said. He gazed on her\r\nwith triumph and malignant pride; and if he still held her his motive\r\nappeared rather the delight he felt in displaying his power over her,\r\nthan any fear that she would escape. You might read in her pale cheek\r\nand glazed eye, that if she feared, it was herself alone that she\r\nmistrusted; that her design lifted her above mortal dread, and that she\r\nwas as impassive as the marble she resembled to any event that did not\r\neither advance or injure the object for which she came. They were both\r\nsilent, until Lostendardo leading her to a seat, and then standing\r\nopposite to her, his arms folded, every feature dilated by triumph, and\r\nhis voice sharpened by agitation, he said: \u201cWell, speak! What wouldst\r\nthou with me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI come to request, that if you cannot be induced to assist Prince\r\nCorradino in the present struggle, you will, at least, stand neutral,\r\nand not oppose his advance to the kingdom of his ancestors.\u201d\r\n\r\nLostendardo laughed. The vaulted roof repeated the sound, but the harsh\r\necho, though it resembled the sharp cry of an animal of prey whose paw\r\nis on the heart of its enemy, was not so discordant and dishuman as the\r\nlaugh itself. \u201cHow,\u201d he asked, \u201cdost thou pretend to induce me to\r\ncomply? This dagger\u201d\u2014and he touched the hilt of one that was half\r\nconcealed in his vesture\u2014\u201cis yet stained by the blood of Manfred; ere\r\nlong it will be sheathed in the heart of that foolish boy.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespina conquered the feeling of horror these words inspired, and\r\nreplied: \u201cWill you give a few minutes\u2019 patient hearing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will give you a few minutes\u2019 hearing, and if I be not so patient as\r\nin the Palagio Reale, fair Despina must excuse me. Forbearance is not a\r\nvirtue to which I aspire.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it was in the Palagio Reale at Naples, the palace of Manfred, that\r\nyou first saw me. You were then the bosom friend of Manfred, selected by\r\nhim as his confidant and counsellor. Why did you become a traitor? Start\r\nnot at that word: if you could hear the united voice of Italy, and even\r\nof those who call themselves your friends, they would echo that name.\r\nWhy did you thus degrade and belie yourself? You call me the cause, yet\r\nI am most innocent. You saw me at the Court of your master, an attendant\r\non Queen Sibilla, and one who, unknown to herself, had already parted\r\nwith her heart, her soul, her will, her entire being, an involuntary\r\nsacrifice at the shrine of all that is noble and divine in human nature.\r\nMy spirit worshipped Manfred as a saint, and my pulses ceased to beat\r\nwhen his eye fell upon me. I felt this, but I knew it not. You awoke me\r\nfrom my dream. You said that you loved me, and you reflected in too\r\nfaithful a mirror my own emotions: I saw myself and shuddered. But the\r\nprofound and eternal nature of my passion saved me. I loved Manfred. I\r\nloved the sun because it enlightened him; I loved the air that fed him;\r\nI deified myself, for that my heart was the temple in which he resided.\r\nI devoted myself to Sibilla, for she was his wife, and never in thought\r\nor dream degraded the purity of my affection towards him. For this you\r\nhated him. He was ignorant of my passion: my heart contained it as a\r\ntreasure, which you having discovered came to rifle. You could more\r\neasily deprive me of life than my devotion for your king, and therefore\r\nyou were a traitor. Manfred died, and you thought that I had then\r\nforgotten him. But love would indeed be a mockery if death were not the\r\nmost barefaced cheat. How can he die who is immortalized in my\r\nthoughts\u2014my thoughts, that comprehend the universe, and contain eternity\r\nin their graspings? What though his earthly vesture is thrown as a\r\ndespised weed beside the verde, he lives in my soul as lovely, as noble,\r\nas entire, as when his voice awoke the mute air; nay, his life is more\r\nentire, more true. For before, that small shrine that encased his spirit\r\nwas all that existed of him; but now, he is a part of all things; his\r\nspirit surrounds me, interpenetrates; and divided from him during his\r\nlife, his death has united me to him for ever.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe countenance of Lostendardo darkened fearfully. When she paused, he\r\nlooked black as the sea before the heavily charged thunder-clouds that\r\ncanopy it dissolve themselves into rain. The tempest of passion that\r\narose in his heart seemed too mighty to admit of swift manifestation; it\r\ncame slowly up from the profoundest depths of his soul, and emotion was\r\npiled upon emotion before the lightning of his anger sped to its\r\ndestination. \u201cYour arguments, eloquent Despina,\u201d he said, \u201care indeed\r\nunanswerable. They work well for your purpose. Corradino is, I hear, at\r\nPisa: you have sharpened my dagger; and before the air of another night\r\nrust it, I may, by deeds, have repaid your insulting words.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow far do you mistake me! And is praise and love of all heroic\r\nexcellence insult to you? Lostendardo, when you first knew me, I was an\r\ninexperienced girl; I loved, but knew not what love was, and\r\ncircumscribing my passion in narrow bounds, I adored the being of\r\nManfred as I might love an effigy of stone, which, when broken, has no\r\nlonger an existence. I am now much altered. I might before have treated\r\nyou with disdain or anger, but now these base feelings have expired in\r\nmy heart. I am animated but by one feeling\u2014an aspiration to another\r\nlife, another state of being. All the good depart from this strange\r\nearth; and I doubt not that when I am sufficiently elevated above human\r\nweaknesses, it will also be my turn to leave this scene of woe. I\r\nprepare myself for that moment alone; and in endeavouring to fit myself\r\nfor a union with all the brave, generous, and wise, that once adorned\r\nhumanity, and have now passed from it, I consecrate myself to the\r\nservice of this most righteous cause. You wrong me, therefore, if you\r\nthink there is aught of disdain in what I say, or that any degrading\r\nfeelings are mingled with my devotion of spirit when I come and\r\nvoluntarily place myself in your power. You can imprison me for ever in\r\nthe dungeons of this palace, as a returned Ghibelline and spy, and have\r\nme executed as a criminal. But before you do this, pause for your own\r\nsake; reflect on the choice of glory or ignominy that you are now about\r\nto make. Let your old sentiments of love for the house of Swabia have\r\nsome sway in your heart; reflect, that as you are the despised enemy, so\r\nyou may become the chosen friend of its last descendant, and receive\r\nfrom every heart the praise of having restored Corradino to the honours\r\nand power to which he was born. Compare this prince to the hypocritical,\r\nthe bloody and mean-spirited Charles. When Manfred died I went to\r\nGermany, and have resided at the court of the Countess Elizabeth; I have\r\ntherefore been an hourly witness of the great and good qualities of\r\nCorradino. The bravery of his spirit makes him rise above the weakness\r\nof youth and inexperience; he possesses all the nobility of spirit that\r\nbelongs to the family of Swabia, and, in addition, a purity and\r\ngentleness that attracts the respect and love of the old and wary\r\ncourtiers of Frederic and Conrad. You are brave, and would be generous,\r\ndid not the fury of your passions, like a consuming fire, destroy in\r\ntheir violence every generous sentiment: how then can you become the\r\ntool of Charles? His scowling eyes and sneering lips betoken the\r\nselfishness of his mind. Avarice, cruelty, meanness, and artifice are\r\nthe qualities that characterize him, and render him unworthy of the\r\nmajesty he usurps. Let him return to Provence, and reign with paltry\r\ndespotism over the luxurious and servile French; the free-born Italians\r\nrequire another lord. They are not fit to bow to one whose palace is the\r\nchange-house of money-lenders, whose generals are usurers, whose\r\ncourtiers are milliners or monks, and who basely vows allegiance to the\r\nenemy of freedom and virtue, Clement, the murderer of Manfred. Their\r\nking, like them, should be clothed in the armour of valour and\r\nsimplicity; his ornaments, his shield and spear; his treasury, the\r\npossessions of his subjects; his army, their unshaken lover. Charles\r\nwill treat you as a tool; Corradino as a friend. Charles will make you\r\nthe detested tyrant of a groaning province; Corradino, the governor of a\r\nprosperous and happy people. I cannot tell by your manner if what I have\r\nsaid has in any degree altered your determination. I cannot forget the\r\nscenes that passed between us at Naples. I might then have been\r\ndisdainful; I am not so now. Your execrations of Manfred excited every\r\nangry feeling in my mind; but, as I have said, all but the feeling of\r\nlove expired in my heart when Manfred died, and methinks that where love\r\nis, excellence must be its companion. You said you loved me; and though,\r\nin other times, that love was twin-brother to hate,\u2014though then, poor\r\nprisoner in your heart, jealousy, rage, contempt, and cruelty, were its\r\nhandmaids,\u2014yet if it were love, methinks that its divinity must have\r\npurified your heart from baser feelings; and now that I, the bride of\r\nDeath, am removed from your sphere, gentler feelings may awaken in your\r\nbosom, and you may incline mildly to my voice. If indeed you loved me,\r\nwill you not now be my friend? Shall we not hand in hand pursue the same\r\ncareer? Return to your ancient faith; and now that death and religion\r\nhave placed the seal upon the past, let Manfred\u2019s spirit, looking down,\r\nbehold his repentant friend the firm ally of his successor, the best and\r\nlast scion of the house of Swabia.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe ceased; for the glare of savage triumph which, as a rising fire at\r\nnight-time, enlightened with growing and fearful radiance the face of\r\nLostendardo, made her pause in her appeal. He did not reply; but when\r\nshe was silent he quitted the attitude in which he had stood immovably\r\nopposite to her, and pacing the hall with measured steps, his head\r\ndeclined, he seemed to ruminate on some project. Could it be that he\r\nweighed her reasonings? If he hesitated, the side of generosity and old\r\nfidelity would certainly prevail. Yet she dared not hope; her heart beat\r\nfast; she would have knelt, but she feared to move, lest any motion\r\nshould disturb his thoughts, and curb the flow of good feeling which she\r\nfondly hoped had arisen within him: she looked up and prayed silently as\r\nshe sat. Notwithstanding the glare of the torches, the beams of one\r\nsmall star struggled through the dark window pane; her eye resting on\r\nit, her thoughts were at once elevated to the eternity and space which\r\nthat star symbolized; it seemed to her the spirit of Manfred, and she\r\ninwardly worshipped it, as she prayed that it would shed its benign\r\ninfluence on the soul of Lostendardo.\r\n\r\nSome minutes elapsed in this fearful silence, and then he approached\r\nher. \u201cDespina, allow me to reflect on your words; to-morrow I will\r\nanswer you. You will remain in this palace until the morning, and then\r\nyou shall see and judge of my repentance and returning faith.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe spoke with studious gentleness. Despina could not see his face, for\r\nthe lights shone behind him. When she looked up to reply, the little\r\nstar twinkled just above his head, and seemed with its gentle lustre to\r\nreassure her. Our minds, when highly wrought, are strangely given to\r\nsuperstition, and Despina lived in a superstitious age. She thought that\r\nthe star bade her comply, and assured her of protection from\r\nHeaven;\u2014from where else could she expect it? She said, therefore, \u201cI\r\nconsent. Only let me request that you acquaint the man who gave you my\r\nring that I am safe, or he will fear for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do as you desire.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I will confide myself to your care. I cannot, dare not, fear you.\r\nIf you would betray me, still I trust in the heavenly saints that guard\r\nhumanity.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer countenance was so calm,\u2014it beamed with so angelic a self-devotion\r\nand a belief in good, that Lostendardo dared not look on her. For one\r\nmoment\u2014as she, having ceased to speak, gazed upon the star\u2014he felt\r\nimpelled to throw himself at her feet, to confess the diabolical scheme\r\nhe had forged, and to commit himself body and soul to her guidance, to\r\nobey, to serve, to worship her. The impulse was momentary; the feeling\r\nof revenge returned on him. From the moment she had rejected him, the\r\nfire of rage had burned in his heart, consuming all healthy feeling, all\r\nhuman sympathies, and gentleness of soul. He had sworn never to sleep on\r\na bed, or to drink aught but water, until his first cup of wine was\r\nmingled with the blood of Manfred. He had fulfilled this vow. A strange\r\nalteration had worked within him from the moment he had drained that\r\nunholy cup. The spirit, not of a man, but of a devil, seemed to live\r\nwithin him, urging him to crime, from which his long protracted hope of\r\nmore complete revenge had alone deterred him. But Despina was now in his\r\npower, and it seemed to him as if fate had preserved him so long only\r\nthat he might now wreak his full rage upon her. When she spoke of love,\r\nhe thought how from that he might extract pain. He formed his plan; and\r\nthis slight human weakness now conquered, he bent his thoughts to its\r\ncompletion. Yet he feared to stay longer with her; so he quitted her,\r\nsaying that he would send attendants who would show her an apartment\r\nwhere she might repose. He left her, and several hours passed; but no\r\none came. The torches burnt low, and the stars of heaven could now with\r\ntwinkling beams conquer their feebler light. One by one these torches\r\nwent out, and the shadows of the high windows of the hall, before\r\ninvisible, were thrown upon its marble pavement. Despina looked upon the\r\nshade, at first unconsciously, until she found herself counting one,\r\ntwo, three, the shapes of the iron bars that lay so placidly on the\r\nstone. \u201cThose grates are thick,\u201d she said; \u201cthis room would be a large\r\nbut secure dungeon.\u201d As by inspiration, she now felt that she was a\r\nprisoner. No change, no word, had intervened since she had walked\r\nfearlessly in the room, believing herself free. But now no doubt of her\r\nsituation occurred to her mind; heavy chains seemed to fall around her;\r\nthe air to feel thick and heavy as that of a prison; and the star-beams\r\nthat had before cheered her, became the dreary messengers of fearful\r\ndanger to herself, and of the utter defeat of all the hopes she had\r\ndared nourish of success to her beloved cause.\r\n\r\nCincolo waited, first with impatience, and then with anxiety, for the\r\nreturn of the youthful stranger. He paced up and down before the gates\r\nof the palace; hour after hour passed on; the stars arose and descended,\r\nand ever and anon meteors shot along the sky. They were not more\r\nfrequent than they always are during a clear summer night in Italy; but\r\nthey appeared strangely numerous to Cincolo, and portentous of change\r\nand calamity. Midnight struck, and at that moment a procession of monks\r\npassed, bearing a corpse and chanting a solemn _De Profundis_. Cincolo\r\nfelt a cold tremor shake his limbs when he reflected how ill an augury\r\nthis was for the strange adventurer he had guided to that palace. The\r\nsombre cowls of the priests, their hollow voices, and the dark burden\r\nthey carried, augmented his agitation even to terror. Without confessing\r\nthe cowardice to himself, he was possessed with fear lest he should be\r\nincluded in the evil destiny that evidently awaited his companion.\r\nCincolo was a brave man; he had often been foremost in a perilous\r\nassault; but the most courageous among us sometimes feel our hearts fail\r\nwithin us at the dread of unknown and fated danger. He was struck with\r\npanic;\u2014he looked after the disappearing lights of the procession, and\r\nlistened to their fading voices; his knees shook, a cold perspiration\r\nstood on his brow; until, unable to resist the impulse, he began slowly\r\nto withdraw himself from the Palace of Government, and to quit the\r\ncircle of danger which seemed to hedge him in if he remained on that\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly quitted his post by the gate of the palace, when he saw\r\nlights issue from it, attendant on a company of men, some of whom were\r\narmed, as appeared from the reflection their lances\u2019 heads cast; and\r\nsome of them carried a litter, hung with black and closely drawn.\r\nCincolo was rooted to the spot. He could not render himself any reason\r\nfor his belief, but he felt convinced that the stranger youth was there,\r\nabout to be carried out to death. Impelled by curiosity and anxiety, he\r\nfollowed the party as they went towards the Porta Romana: they were\r\nchallenged by the sentinels at the gate; they gave the word and passed.\r\nCincolo dared not follow, but he was agitated by fear and compassion. He\r\nremembered the packet confided to his care; he dared not draw it from\r\nhis bosom, lest any Guelph should be near to overlook and discover that\r\nit was addressed to Corradino; he could not read, but he wished to look\r\nat the arms of the seal, to see whether they bore the imperial ensigns.\r\nHe returned back to the _Palagio del Governo_: all there was dark and\r\nsilent; he walked up and down before the gates, looking up at the\r\nwindows, but no sign of life appeared. He could not tell why he was thus\r\nagitated, but he felt as if all his future peace depended on the fate of\r\nthis stranger youth. He thought of Gegia, her helplessness and age; but\r\nhe could not resist the impulse that impelled him, and he resolved that\r\nvery night to commence his journey to Pisa, to deliver the packet, to\r\nlearn who the stranger was, and what hopes he might entertain for his\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nHe returned home, that he might inform Gegia of his journey. This was a\r\npainful task, but he could not leave her in doubt. He ascended his\r\nnarrow stairs with trepidation. At the head of them a lamp twinkled\r\nbefore a picture of the Virgin. Evening after evening it burnt there,\r\nguarding through its influence his little household from all earthly or\r\nsupernatural dangers. The sight of it inspired him with courage; he said\r\nan _Ave Maria_ before it; and then looking around him to assure himself\r\nthat no spy stood on the narrow landing-place, he drew the packet from\r\nhis bosom and examined the seal. All Italians in those days were\r\nconversant in heraldry, since from ensigns of the shields of the knights\r\nthey learned, better than from their faces or persons, to what family\r\nand party they belonged. But it required no great knowledge for Cincolo\r\nto decipher these arms; he had known them from his childhood; they were\r\nthose of the Elisei, the family to whom he had been attached as a\r\npartisan during all these civil contests. Arrigo de\u2019 Elisei had been his\r\npatron, and his wife had nursed his only daughter, in those happy days\r\nwhen there was neither Guelph nor Ghibelline. The sight of these arms\r\nreawakened all his anxiety. Could this youth belong to that house? The\r\nseal showed that he really did; and this discovery confirmed his\r\ndetermination of making every exertion to save him, and inspired him\r\nwith sufficient courage to encounter the remonstrances and fears of\r\nMonna Gegia.\r\n\r\nHe unlocked his door; the old dame was asleep in her chair, but awoke as\r\nhe entered. She had slept only to refresh her curiosity, and she asked a\r\nthousand questions in a breath, to which Cincolo did not reply: he stood\r\nwith his arms folded looking at the fire, irresolute how to break the\r\nsubject of his departure. Monna Gegia continued to talk.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter you went, we held a consultation concerning this hot-brained\r\nyouth of this morning: I, Buzeccha, Beppe de\u2019 Bosticchi who returned,\r\nand Monna Lissa from the Mercato Nuovo. We all agreed that he must be\r\none of two persons; and be it one or the other, if he have not quitted\r\nFlorence, the _Stinchi_[3] will be his habitation by sunrise. Eh,\r\nCincolo, man! you do not speak; where did you part with your prince?\u201d\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  The name of the common prison at Florence.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrince, Gegia! Are you mad?\u2014what prince?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay, he is either a prince or a baker; either Corradino himself, or\r\nRicciardo, the son of Messer Tommaso de\u2019 Manelli; he that lived o\u2019th\u2019\r\nArno, and baked for all that Sesto, when Count Guido de Giudi was\r\n_Vicario_. By this token, that Messer Tommaso went to Milan with Ubaldo\r\nde\u2019 Gargalandi, and Ricciardo, who went with his father, must now be\r\nsixteen. He had the fame of kneading with as light a hand as his father,\r\nbut he liked better to follow arms with the Gargalandi. He was a fair,\r\nlikely youth, they said; and so, to say the truth, was our youngster of\r\nthis morning. But Monna Lissa will have it that it must be Corradino\r\nhimself.\u201d\r\n\r\nCincolo listened as if the gossip of two old women could unravel his\r\nriddle. He even began to doubt whether the last conjecture, extravagant\r\nas it was, had not hit the truth. Every circumstance forbade such an\r\nidea; but he thought of the youth and exceeding beauty of the stranger,\r\nand he began to doubt. There was none among the Elisei who answered to\r\nhis appearance. The flower of their youth had fallen at Monte Aperto;\r\nthe eldest of the new generation was but ten; the other males of that\r\nhouse were of a mature age. Gegia continued to talk of the anger that\r\nBeppe de\u2019 Bosticchi evinced at being accused of the murder of Arrigo de\u2019\r\nElisei. \u201cIf he had done that deed,\u201d she cried, \u201cnever more should he\r\nhave stood on my hearth; but he swore his innocence; and truly, poor\r\nman, it would be a sin not to believe him.\u201d Why, if the stranger were\r\nnot an Elisei, should he have shown such horror on viewing the supposed\r\nmurderer of the head of that family? Cincolo turned from the fire; he\r\nexamined whether his knife hung safely in his girdle, and he exchanged\r\nhis sandal-like shoes for stronger boots of common undressed fur. This\r\nlast act attracted the attentions of Gegia.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you about, good man?\u201d she cried. \u201cThis is no hour to change\r\nyour dress, but to come to bed. To-night you will not speak; but\r\nto-morrow I hope to get it all out from you. What are you about?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am about to leave you, my dear Gegia; and Heaven bless and take care\r\nof you! I am going to Pisa.\u201d\r\n\r\nGegia uttered a shriek, and was about to remonstrate with great\r\nvolubility, while the tears rolled down her aged cheeks. Tears also\r\nfilled the eyes of Cincolo, as he said, \u201cI do not go for the cause you\r\nsuspect. I do not go into the army of Corradino, though my heart will be\r\nwith it. I go but to carry a letter, and will return without delay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will never return,\u201d cried the old woman: \u201cthe Commune will never\r\nlet you enter the gates of this town again, if you set foot in that\r\ntraitorous Pisa. But you shall not go; I will raise the neighbours; I\r\nwill declare you mad\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cGegia, no more of this! Here is all the money I have. Before I go, I\r\nwill send your Cousin \u2019Nunziata to you. I must go. It is not the\r\nGhibelline cause, or Corradino, that obliges me to risk your ease and\r\ncomforts; but the life of one of the Elisei is at stake; and if I can\r\nsave him, would you have me rest here, and afterwards curse you and the\r\nhour when I was born?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! is he\u2014\u2014? But no; there is none among the Elisei so young as he;\r\nand none so lovely, except her whom these arms carried when an\r\ninfant\u2014but she is a female. No, no; this is a tale trumped up to deceive\r\nme and gain my consent; but you shall never have it. Mind that! you will\r\nnever have it! and I prophesy that if you do go, your journey will be\r\nthe death of both of us.\u201d She wept bitterly. Cincolo kissed her aged\r\ncheek, and mingled his tears with hers; and then recommending her to the\r\ncare of the Virgin and the saints, he quitted her; while grief choked\r\nher utterance, the name of the Elisei had deprived her of all energy to\r\nresist his purpose.\r\n\r\nIt was four in the morning before the gates of Florence were opened and\r\nCincolo could leave the city. At first he availed himself of the carts\r\nof the _contadini_ to advance on his journey; but as he drew near Pisa,\r\nall modes of conveyance ceased, and he was obliged to take by-roads, and\r\nact cautiously, not to fall into the hands of the Florentine outposts,\r\nor of some fierce Ghibelline, who might suspect him, and have him\r\ncarried before the Podesta of the village; for if once suspected and\r\nsearched, the packet addressed to Corradino would convict him, and he\r\nwould pay for his temerity with his life. Having arrived at Vico Pisano,\r\nhe found a troop of Pisan horse there on guard; he was known to many of\r\nthe soldiers, and he obtained a conveyance for Pisa; but it was night\r\nbefore he arrived. He gave the Ghibelline watchword, and was admitted\r\nwithin the gates. He asked for Prince Corradino: he was in the city, at\r\nthe palace of the Lanfranchi. He crossed the Arno, and was admitted into\r\nthe palace by the soldiers who guarded the door.\r\n\r\nCorradino had just returned from a successful skirmish in the Lucchese\r\nstates, and was reposing; but when Count Gherardo Doneratico, his\r\nprincipal attendant, saw the seal of the packet, he immediately ushered\r\nthe bearer into a small room, where the prince lay on a fox\u2019s skin\r\nthrown upon the pavement. The mind of Cincolo had been so bewildered by\r\nthe rapidity of the events of the preceding night, by fatigue and want\r\nof sleep, that he had overwrought himself to believe that the stranger\r\nyouth was indeed Corradino; and when he had heard that that prince was\r\nin Pisa, by a strange disorder of ideas he still imagined that he and\r\nRicciardo were the same; that the black litter was a phantom, and his\r\nfears ungrounded. The first sight of Corradino, his fair hair and round\r\nSaxon features, destroyed this idea: it was replaced by a feeling of\r\ndeep anguish, when Count Gherardo, announcing him, said, \u201cOne who brings\r\na letter from Madonna Despina dei Elisei, waits upon your Highness.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old man sprang forward, uncontrolled by the respect he would\r\notherwise have felt for one of so high lineage as Corradino. \u201cFrom\r\nDespina! Did you say from her? Oh! unsay your words! Not from my\r\nbeloved, lost foster-child.\u201d\r\n\r\nTears rolled down his cheeks. Corradino, a youth of fascinating\r\ngentleness, attempted to reassure him. \u201cOh! my gracious Lord,\u201d cried\r\nCincolo, \u201copen that packet, and see if it be from my blessed child\u2014if in\r\nthe disguise of Ricciardo I led her to destruction.\u201d He wrung his hands.\r\nCorradino, pale as death with fear for the destiny of his lovely and\r\nadventurous friend, broke the seal. The packet contained an inner\r\nenvelope without any direction, and a letter, which Corradino read,\r\nwhile horror convulsed every feature. He gave it to Gherardo. \u201cIt is\r\nindeed from her. She says that the bearer can relate all that the world\r\nwill probably know of her fate. And you old man, who weep so bitterly,\r\nyou to whom my best and lovely friend refers me, tell me what you know\r\nof her!\u201d\r\n\r\nCincolo told his story in broken accents. \u201cMay these eyes be for ever\r\nblinded!\u201d he cried, when he had concluded, \u201cthat knew not Despina in\r\nthose soft looks and heavenly smiles. Dotard that I am! When my wife\r\nrailed at your family and princely self, and the sainted Manfred, why\r\ndid I not read her secret in her forbearance? Would she have forgiven\r\nthose words in any but her who had nursed her infancy, and been a mother\r\nto her when Madonna Pia died? And when she taxed Bosticchi with her\r\nfather\u2019s death, I, blind fool, did not see the spirit of the Elisei in\r\nher eyes. My Lord, I have but one favour to ask you. Let me hear her\r\nletter, that I may judge from that what hopes remain;\u2014but there are\r\nnone\u2014none.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRead to him, my dear count,\u201d said the prince; \u201cI will not fear as he\r\nfears. I dare not fear that one so lovely and beloved is sacrificed for\r\nmy worthless cause.\u201d Gherardo read the letter.\r\n\r\n    \u201cCincolo de\u2019 Becari, my foster-father, will deliver this letter into\r\n    your hands, my respected and dear Corradino. The Countess Elizabeth\r\n    has urged me to my present undertaking; I hope nothing from it,\r\n    except to labour for your cause, and perhaps, through its event, to\r\n    quit somewhat earlier a life which is but a grievous trial to my\r\n    weak mind. I go to endeavour to arouse the feelings of fidelity and\r\n    generosity in the soul of the traitor Lostendardo; I go to place\r\n    myself in his hands, and I do not hope to escape from them again.\r\n    Corradino, my last prayer will be for your success. Mourn not for\r\n    one who goes home after a long and weary exile. Burn the enclosed\r\n    packet without opening it. The Mother of God protect thee!\u201d\r\n\r\n                        \u201cDESPINA.\u201d\r\n\r\nCorradino had wept as this epistle was reading, but then, starting up,\r\nhe said, \u201cTo revenge or death! we may yet save her!\u201d\r\n\r\nA blight had fallen on the house of Swabia, and all their enterprises\r\nwere blasted. Beloved by their subjects, noble, and with every advantage\r\nof right on their side, except those the Church bestowed, they were\r\ndefeated in every attempt to defend themselves against a foreigner and a\r\ntyrant, who ruled by force of arms, and those in the hands of a few\r\nonly, over an extensive and warlike territory. The young and daring\r\nCorradino was also fated to perish in this contest. Having overcome the\r\ntroops of his adversary in Tuscany, he advanced towards his kingdom with\r\nthe highest hopes. His arch-enemy, Pope Clement IV., had shut himself up\r\nin Viterbo, and was guarded by a numerous garrison. Corradino passed in\r\ntriumph and hope before the town, and proudly drew out his troops before\r\nit, to display to the Holy Father his forces, and humiliate him by this\r\nshow of success. The cardinals, who beheld the lengthened line and good\r\norder of the army, hastened to the papal palace. Clement was in his\r\noratory praying. The frightened monks, with pale looks, related how the\r\nexcommunicated heretic dared to menace the town where the Holy Father\r\nhimself resided; adding, that if the insult were carried to the pitch of\r\nan assault, it might prove dangerous warfare. The pope smiled\r\ncontemptuously. \u201cDo not fear,\u201d he said; \u201cthe projects of these men will\r\ndissipate in smoke.\u201d He then went on the ramparts, and saw Corradino and\r\nFrederic of Austria, who defiled the line of knights in the plain below.\r\nHe watched them for a time; then turning to his cardinals, he said,\r\n\u201cThey are victims, who permit themselves to be led to sacrifice.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis words were a prophecy. Notwithstanding the first successes of\r\nCorradino, and the superior numbers of his army, he was defeated by the\r\nartifice of Charles in a pitched battle. He escaped from the field, and,\r\nwith a few friends, arrived at a tower called Asturi, which belonged to\r\nthe family of Frangipani, of Rome. Here he hired a vessel, embarked, and\r\nput out to sea, directing his course for Sicily, which, having rebelled\r\nagainst Charles, would, he hoped, receive him with joy. They were\r\nalready under weigh, when one of the family of the Frangipani, seeing a\r\nvessel filled with Germans making all sail from shore, suspected that\r\nthey were fugitives from the battle of Taglicozzo. He followed them in\r\nother vessels, and took them all prisoners. The person of Corradino was\r\na rich prey for him; he delivered him into the hands of his rival, and\r\nwas rewarded by the donation of a fief near Benevento.\r\n\r\nThe dastardly spirit of Charles instigated him to the basest revenge;\r\nand the same tragedy was acted on those shores which has been renewed in\r\nour days. A daring and illustrious prince was sacrificed with the mock\r\nforms of justice, at the sanguinary altar of tyranny and hypocrisy.\r\nCorradino was tried. One of his judges alone, a Proven\u00e7al, dared to\r\ncondemn him, and he paid with his life the forfeit of his baseness. For\r\nscarcely had he, solitary among his fellows, pronounced the sentence of\r\ndeath against this prince, than Robert of Flanders, the brother-in-law\r\nof Charles himself, struck him on the breast with a staff, crying, \u201cIt\r\nbehoves not thee, wretch, to condemn to death so noble and worthy a\r\nknight.\u201d The judge fell dead in the presence of the king, who dared not\r\navenge his creature.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of October Corradino and his friends were led out to die in\r\nthe market-place of Naples, by the seaside. Charles was present with all\r\nhis court, and an immense multitude surrounded the triumphant king, and\r\nhis more royal adversary, about to suffer an ignominious death. The\r\nfunereal procession approached its destination. Corradino, agitated, but\r\ncontrolling his agitation, was drawn in an open car. After him came a\r\nclose litter, hung with black, with no sign to tell who was within. The\r\nDuke of Austria and several other illustrious victims followed. The\r\nguard that conducted them to the scaffold was headed by Lostendardo; a\r\nmalicious triumph laughed in his eyes, and he rode near the litter,\r\nlooking from time to time first at it and then at Corradino, with the\r\ndark look of a tormenting fiend. The procession stopped at the foot of\r\nthe scaffold, and Corradino looked at the flashing light which every now\r\nand then arose from Vesuvius, and threw its reflection on the sea. The\r\nsun had not yet risen, but the halo of its approach illuminated the bay\r\nof Naples, its mountains, and its islands. The summits of the distant\r\nhills of Bai\u00e6 gleamed with its first beams. Corradino thought, \u201cBy the\r\ntime those rays arrive here, and shadows are cast from the persons of\r\nthese men\u2014princes and peasants\u2014around me, my living spirit will be\r\nshadowless.\u201d Then he turned his eyes on the companions of his fate, and\r\nfor the first time he saw the silent and dark litter that accompanied\r\nthem. At first he thought, \u201cIt is my coffin.\u201d But then he recollected\r\nthe disappearance of Despina, and would have sprang towards it. His\r\nguards stopped him; he looked up, and his glance met that of\r\nLostendardo, who smiled\u2014a smile of dread; but the feeling of religion\r\nwhich had before calmed him again descended on him; he thought that her\r\nsufferings, as well as his, would soon be over.\r\n\r\nThey were already over; and the silence of the grave is upon those\r\nevents which had occurred since Cincolo beheld her carried out of\r\nFlorence, until now that she was led by her fierce enemy to behold the\r\ndeath of the nephew of Manfred. She must have endured much; for when, as\r\nCorradino advanced to the front of the scaffold, the litter being placed\r\nopposite to it, Lostendardo ordered the curtains to be withdrawn, the\r\nwhite hand that hung inanimate from the side was thin as a winter leaf,\r\nand her fair face, pillowed by the thick knots of her dark hair, was\r\nsunken and ashy pale, while you could see the deep blue of her eyes\r\nstruggle through the closed eyelids. She was still in the attire in\r\nwhich she had presented herself at the house of Cincolo. Perhaps her\r\ntormentor thought that her appearance as a youth would attract less\r\ncompassion than if a lovely woman were thus dragged to so unnatural a\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nCorradino was kneeling and praying when her form was thus exposed. He\r\nsaw her, and saw that she was dead! About to die himself; about, pure\r\nand innocent, to die ignominiously, while his base conqueror, in pomp\r\nand glory, was spectator of his death, he did not pity those who were at\r\npeace; his compassion belonged to the living alone; and as he arose from\r\nhis prayer he exclaimed, \u201cMy beloved mother, what profound sorrow will\r\nthe news thou art about to hear cause thee!\u201d He looked upon the living\r\nmultitude around him, and saw that the hard-visaged partisans of the\r\nusurper wept; he heard the sobs of his oppressed and conquered subjects;\r\nso he drew his glove from his hand and threw it among the crowd, in\r\ntoken that he still held his cause good, and submitted his head to the\r\naxe.\r\n\r\nDuring many years after those events, Lostendardo enjoyed wealth, rank,\r\nand power. When suddenly, while at the summit of glory and prosperity,\r\nhe withdrew from the world, took the vows of a severe order in a convent\r\nin one of the desolate and unhealthy plains by the sea-shore in\r\nCalabria; and after having gained the character of a saint, through a\r\nlife of self-inflicted torture, he died murmuring the names of\r\nCorradino, Manfred, and Despina.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VIII.\r\n\r\n                         _THE MORTAL IMMORTAL._\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY 16, 1833.\u2014This is a memorable anniversary for me; on it I complete\r\nmy three hundred and twenty-third year!\r\n\r\nThe Wandering Jew?\u2014certainly not.

This is a question which I have asked myself, by\r\nday and night, for now three hundred and three years, and yet cannot\r\nanswer it.

Yet it may have remained concealed\r\nthere for three hundred years\u2014for some persons have become entirely\r\nwhite-headed before twenty years of age.\r\n\r\nI will tell my story, and my reader shall judge for me. I will tell my\r\nstory, and so contrive to pass some few hours of a long eternity, become\r\nso wearisome to me. For ever! Can it be? to live for ever! I have heard\r\nof enchantments, in which the victims were plunged into a deep sleep, to\r\nwake, after a hundred years, as fresh as ever: I have heard of the Seven\r\nSleepers\u2014thus to be immortal would not be so burthensome: but, oh! the\r\nweight of never-ending time\u2014the tedious passage of the still-succeeding\r\nhours! How happy was the fabled Nourjahad!\u2014But to my task.\r\n\r\nAll the world has heard of Cornelius Agrippa. His memory is as immortal\r\nas his arts have made me. All the world has also heard of his scholar,\r\nwho, unawares, raised the foul fiend during his master\u2019s absence, and\r\nwas destroyed by him. The report, true or false, of this accident, was\r\nattended with many inconveniences to the renowned philosopher. All his\r\nscholars at once deserted him\u2014his servants disappeared. He had no one\r\nnear him to put coals on his ever-burning fires while he slept, or to\r\nattend to the changeful colours of his medicines while he studied.\r\nExperiment after experiment failed, because one pair of hands was\r\ninsufficient to complete them: the dark spirits laughed at him for not\r\nbeing able to retain a single mortal in his service.\r\n\r\nI was then very young\u2014very poor\u2014and very much in love. I had been for\r\nabout a year the pupil of Cornelius, though I was absent when this\r\naccident took place. On my return, my friends implored me not to return\r\nto the alchymist\u2019s abode. I trembled as I listened to the dire tale they\r\ntold; I required no second warning; and when Cornelius came and offered\r\nme a purse of gold if I would remain under his roof, I felt as if Satan\r\nhimself tempted me. My teeth chattered\u2014my hair stood on end;\u2014I ran off\r\nas fast as my trembling knees would permit.\r\n\r\nMy failing steps were directed whither for two years they had every\r\nevening been attracted,\u2014a gently bubbling spring of pure living water,\r\nbeside which lingered a dark-haired girl, whose beaming eyes were fixed\r\non the path I was accustomed each night to tread. I cannot remember the\r\nhour when I did not love Bertha; we had been neighbours and playmates\r\nfrom infancy,\u2014her parents, like mine, were of humble life, yet\r\nrespectable,\u2014our attachment had been a source of pleasure to them. In an\r\nevil hour, a malignant fever carried off both her father and mother, and\r\nBertha became an orphan. She would have found a home beneath my paternal\r\nroof, but, unfortunately, the old lady of the near castle, rich,\r\nchildless, and solitary, declared her intention to adopt her. Henceforth\r\nBertha was clad in silk\u2014inhabited a marble palace\u2014and was looked on as\r\nbeing highly favoured by fortune. But in her new situation among her new\r\nassociates, Bertha remained true to the friend of her humbler days; she\r\noften visited the cottage of my father, and when forbidden to go\r\nthither, she would stray towards the neighbouring wood, and meet me\r\nbeside its shady fountain.\r\n\r\nShe often declared that she owed no duty to her new protectress equal in\r\nsanctity to that which bound us. Yet still I was too poor to marry, and\r\nshe grew weary of being tormented on my account. She had a haughty but\r\nan impatient spirit, and grew angry at the obstacles that prevented our\r\nunion. We met now after an absence, and she had been sorely beset while\r\nI was away; she complained bitterly, and almost reproached me for being\r\npoor. I replied hastily,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI am honest, if I am poor!\u2014were I not, I might soon become rich!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis exclamation produced a thousand questions. I feared to shock her by\r\nowning the truth, but she drew it from me; and then, casting a look of\r\ndisdain on me, she said,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou pretend to love, and you fear to face the Devil for my sake!\u201d\r\n\r\nI protested that I had only dreaded to offend her;\u2014while she dwelt on\r\nthe magnitude of the reward that I should receive. Thus\r\nencouraged\u2014shamed by her\u2014led on by love and hope, laughing at my late\r\nfears, with quick steps and a light heart, I returned to accept the\r\noffers of the alchymist, and was instantly installed in my office.\r\n\r\nA year passed away. I became possessed of no insignificant sum of money.\r\nCustom had banished my fears. In spite of the most painful vigilance, I\r\nhad never detected the trace of a cloven foot; nor was the studious\r\nsilence of our abode ever disturbed by demoniac howls. I still continued\r\nmy stolen interviews with Bertha, and Hope dawned on me\u2014Hope\u2014but not\r\nperfect joy; for Bertha fancied that love and security were enemies, and\r\nher pleasure was to divide them in my bosom. Though true of heart, she\r\nwas somewhat of a coquette in manner; and I was jealous as a Turk. She\r\nslighted me in a thousand ways, yet would never acknowledge herself to\r\nbe in the wrong. She would drive me mad with anger, and then force me to\r\nbeg her pardon. Sometimes she fancied that I was not sufficiently\r\nsubmissive, and then she had some story of a rival, favoured by her\r\nprotectress. She was surrounded by silk-clad youths\u2014the rich and gay.\r\nWhat chance had the sad-robed scholar of Cornelius compared with these?\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, the philosopher made such large demands upon my time,\r\nthat I was unable to meet her as I was wont. He was engaged in some\r\nmighty work, and I was forced to remain, day and night, feeding his\r\nfurnaces and watching his chemical preparations. Bertha waited for me in\r\nvain at the fountain. Her haughty spirit fired at this neglect; and when\r\nat last I stole out during the few short minutes allotted to me for\r\nslumber, and hoped to be consoled by her, she received me with disdain,\r\ndismissed me in scorn, and vowed that any man should possess her hand\r\nrather than he who could not be in two places at once for her sake. She\r\nwould be revenged! And truly she was. In my dingy retreat I heard that\r\nshe had been hunting, attended by Albert Hoffer. Albert Hoffer was\r\nfavoured by her protectress; and the three passed in cavalcade before my\r\nsmoky window. Methought that they mentioned my name; it was followed by\r\na laugh of derision, as her dark eyes glanced contemptuously towards my\r\nabode.\r\n\r\nJealousy, with all its venom and all its misery, entered my breast. Now\r\nI shed a torrent of tears, to think that I should never call her mine;\r\nand, anon, I imprecated a thousand curses on her inconstancy. Yet, still\r\nI must stir the fires of the alchymist, still attend on the changes of\r\nhis unintelligible medicines.\r\n\r\nCornelius had watched for three days and nights, nor closed his eyes.\r\nThe progress of his alembics was slower than he expected: in spite of\r\nhis anxiety, sleep weighed upon his eyelids. Again and again he threw\r\noff drowsiness with more than human energy; again and again it stole\r\naway his senses. He eyed his crucibles wistfully. \u201cNot ready yet,\u201d he\r\nmurmured; \u201cwill another night pass before the work is accomplished?\r\nWinzy, you are vigilant\u2014you are faithful\u2014you have slept, my boy\u2014you\r\nslept last night. Look at that glass vessel. The liquid it contains is\r\nof a soft rose-colour: the moment it begins to change its hue, awaken\r\nme\u2014till then I may close my eyes. First, it will turn white, and then\r\nemit golden flashes; but wait not till then; when the rose-colour fades,\r\nrouse me.\u201d I scarcely heard the last words, muttered, as they were, in\r\nsleep. Even then he did not quite yield to nature. \u201cWinzy, my boy,\u201d he\r\nagain said, \u201cdo not touch the vessel\u2014do not put it to your lips; it is a\r\nphilter\u2014a philter to cure love; you would not cease to love your\r\nBertha\u2014beware to drink!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd he slept. His venerable head sunk on his breast, and I scarce heard\r\nhis regular breathing. For a few minutes I watched the vessel\u2014the rosy\r\nhue of the liquid remained unchanged. Then my thoughts wandered\u2014they\r\nvisited the fountain, and dwelt on a thousand charming scenes never to\r\nbe renewed\u2014never! Serpents and adders were in my heart as the word\r\n\u201cNever!\u201d half formed itself on my lips. False girl!\u2014false and cruel!\r\nNever more would she smile on me as that evening she smiled on Albert.\r\nWorthless, detested woman! I would not remain unrevenged\u2014she should see\r\nAlbert expire at her feet\u2014she should die beneath my vengeance. She had\r\nsmiled in disdain and triumph\u2014she knew my wretchedness and her power.\r\nYet what power had she?\u2014the power of exciting my hate\u2014my utter\r\nscorn\u2014my\u2014oh, all but indifference! Could I attain that\u2014could I regard\r\nher with careless eyes, transferring my rejected love to one fairer and\r\nmore true, that were indeed a victory!\r\n\r\nA bright flash darted before my eyes. I had forgotten the medicine of\r\nthe adept; I gazed on it with wonder: flashes of admirable beauty, more\r\nbright than those which the diamond emits when the sun\u2019s rays are on it,\r\nglanced from the surface of the liquid; an odour the most fragrant and\r\ngrateful stole over my sense; the vessel seemed one globe of living\r\nradiance, lovely to the eye, and most inviting to the taste. The first\r\nthought, instinctively inspired by the grosser sense, was, I will\u2014I must\r\ndrink. I raised the vessel to my lips. \u201cIt will cure me of love\u2014of\r\ntorture!\u201d Already I had quaffed half of the most delicious liquor ever\r\ntasted by the palate of man, when the philosopher stirred. I started\u2014I\r\ndropped the glass\u2014the fluid flamed and glanced along the floor, while I\r\nfelt Cornelius\u2019s gripe at my throat, as he shrieked aloud, \u201cWretch! you\r\nhave destroyed the labour of my life!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe philosopher was totally unaware that I had drunk any portion of his\r\ndrug. His idea was, and I gave a tacit assent to it, that I had raised\r\nthe vessel from curiosity, and that, frighted at its brightness, and the\r\nflashes of intense light it gave forth, I had let it fall. I never\r\nundeceived him. The fire of the medicine was quenched\u2014the fragrance died\r\naway\u2014he grew calm, as a philosopher should under the heaviest trials,\r\nand dismissed me to rest.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to describe the sleep of glory and bliss which bathed\r\nmy soul in paradise during the remaining hours of that memorable night.\r\nWords would be faint and shallow types of my enjoyment, or of the\r\ngladness that possessed my bosom when I woke. I trod air\u2014my thoughts\r\nwere in heaven. Earth appeared heaven, and my inheritance upon it was to\r\nbe one trance of delight. \u201cThis it is to be cured of love,\u201d I thought;\r\n\u201cI will see Bertha this day, and she will find her lover cold and\r\nregardless; too happy to be disdainful, yet how utterly indifferent to\r\nher!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe hours danced away. The philosopher, secure that he had once\r\nsucceeded, and believing that he might again, began to concoct the same\r\nmedicine once more. He was shut up with his books and drugs, and I had a\r\nholiday. I dressed myself with care; I looked in an old but polished\r\nshield, which served me for a mirror; methought my good looks had\r\nwonderfully improved. I hurried beyond the precincts of the town, joy in\r\nmy soul, the beauty of heaven and earth around me. I turned my steps\r\ntowards the castle\u2014I could look on its lofty turrets with lightness of\r\nheart, for I was cured of love. My Bertha saw me afar off, as I came up\r\nthe avenue. I know not what sudden impulse animated her bosom, but at\r\nthe sight, she sprung with a light fawn-like bound down the marble\r\nsteps, and was hastening towards me. But I had been perceived by another\r\nperson. The old high-born hag, who called herself her protectress, and\r\nwas her tyrant, had seen me also; she hobbled, panting, up the terrace;\r\na page, as ugly as herself, held up her train, and fanned her as she\r\nhurried along, and stopped my fair girl with a \u201cHow, now, my bold\r\nmistress? whither so fast? Back to your cage\u2014hawks are abroad!\u201d\r\n\r\nBertha clasped her hands\u2014her eyes were still bent on my approaching\r\nfigure. I saw the contest. How I abhorred the old crone who checked\r\nthe kind impulses of my Bertha\u2019s softening heart. Hitherto, respect\r\nfor her rank had caused me to avoid the lady of the castle; now I\r\ndisdained such trivial considerations. I was cured of love, and lifted\r\nabove all human fears; I hastened forwards, and soon reached the\r\nterrace. How lovely Bertha looked! her eyes flashing fire, her cheeks\r\nglowing with impatience and anger, she was a thousand times more\r\ngraceful and charming than ever. I no longer loved\u2014Oh no! I\r\nadored\u2014worshipped\u2014idolized her!\r\n\r\nShe had that morning been persecuted, with more than usual vehemence, to\r\nconsent to an immediate marriage with my rival. She was reproached with\r\nthe encouragement that she had shown him\u2014she was threatened with being\r\nturned out of doors with disgrace and shame. Her proud spirit rose in\r\narms at the threat; but when she remembered the scorn that she had\r\nheaped upon me, and how, perhaps, she had thus lost one whom she now\r\nregarded as her only friend, she wept with remorse and rage. At that\r\nmoment I appeared. \u201cOh, Winzy!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201ctake me to your mother\u2019s\r\ncot; swiftly let me leave the detested luxuries and wretchedness of this\r\nnoble dwelling\u2014take me to poverty and happiness.\u201d\r\n\r\nI clasped her in my arms with transport. The old dame was speechless\r\nwith fury, and broke forth into invective only when we were far on our\r\nroad to my natal cottage. My mother received the fair fugitive, escaped\r\nfrom a gilt cage to nature and liberty, with tenderness and joy; my\r\nfather, who loved her, welcomed her heartily; it was a day of rejoicing,\r\nwhich did not need the addition of the celestial potion of the alchymist\r\nto steep me in delight.\r\n\r\nSoon after this eventful day, I became the husband of Bertha. I ceased\r\nto be the scholar of Cornelius, but I continued his friend. I always\r\nfelt grateful to him for having, unawares, procured me that delicious\r\ndraught of a divine elixir, which, instead of curing me of love (sad\r\ncure! solitary and joyless remedy for evils which seem blessings to the\r\nmemory), had inspired me with courage and resolution, thus winning for\r\nme an inestimable treasure in my Bertha.\r\n\r\nI often called to mind that period of trance-like inebriation with\r\nwonder. The drink of Cornelius had not fulfilled the task for which he\r\naffirmed that it had been prepared, but its effects were more potent and\r\nblissful than words can express. They had faded by degrees, yet they\r\nlingered long\u2014and painted life in hues of splendour. Bertha often\r\nwondered at my lightness of heart and unaccustomed gaiety; for, before,\r\nI had been rather serious, or even sad, in my disposition. She loved me\r\nthe better for my cheerful temper, and our days were winged by joy.\r\n\r\nFive years afterwards I was suddenly summoned to the bedside of the\r\ndying Cornelius. He had sent for me in haste, conjuring my instant\r\npresence. I found him stretched on his pallet, enfeebled even to death;\r\nall of life that yet remained animated his piercing eyes, and they were\r\nfixed on a glass vessel, full of a roseate liquid.\r\n\r\n\u201cBehold,\u201d he said, in a broken and inward voice, \u201cthe vanity of human\r\nwishes! a second time my hopes are about to be crowned, a second time\r\nthey are destroyed. Look at that liquor\u2014you remember five years ago I\r\nhad prepared the same, with the same success;\u2014then, as now, my thirsting\r\nlips expected to taste the immortal elixir\u2014you dashed it from me! and at\r\npresent it is too late.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe spoke with difficulty, and fell back on his pillow. I could not help\r\nsaying,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHow, revered master, can a cure for love restore you to life?\u201d\r\n\r\nA faint smile gleamed across his face as I listened earnestly to his\r\nscarcely intelligible answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cA cure for love and for all things\u2014the Elixir of Immortality. Ah! if\r\nnow I might drink, I should live for ever!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, a golden flash gleamed from the fluid; a well-remembered\r\nfragrance stole over the air; he raised himself, all weak as he\r\nwas\u2014strength seemed miraculously to re-enter his frame\u2014he stretched\r\nforth his hand\u2014a loud explosion startled me\u2014a ray of fire shot up from\r\nthe elixir, and the glass vessel which contained it was shivered to\r\natoms! I turned my eyes towards the philosopher; he had fallen back\u2014his\r\neyes were glassy\u2014his features rigid\u2014he was dead!\r\n\r\nBut I lived, and was to live for ever! So said the unfortunate\r\nalchymist, and for a few days I believed his words. I remembered the\r\nglorious intoxication that had followed my stolen draught. I reflected\r\non the change I had felt in my frame\u2014in my soul. The bounding elasticity\r\nof the one\u2014the buoyant lightness of the other. I surveyed myself in a\r\nmirror, and could perceive no change in my features during the space of\r\nthe five years which had elapsed. I remembered the radiant hues and\r\ngrateful scent of that delicious beverage\u2014worthy the gift it was capable\r\nof bestowing\u2014I was, then, IMMORTAL!\r\n\r\nA few days after I laughed at my credulity. The old proverb, that \u201ca\r\nprophet is least regarded in his own country,\u201d was true with respect to\r\nme and my defunct master. I loved him as a man\u2014I respected him as a\r\nsage\u2014but I derided the notion that he could command the powers of\r\ndarkness, and laughed at the superstitious fears with which he was\r\nregarded by the vulgar. He was a wise philosopher, but had no\r\nacquaintance with any spirits but those clad in flesh and blood. His\r\nscience was simply human; and human science, I soon persuaded myself,\r\ncould never conquer nature\u2019s laws so far as to imprison the soul for\r\never within its carnal habitation. Cornelius had brewed a\r\nsoul-refreshing drink\u2014more inebriating than wine\u2014sweeter and more\r\nfragrant than any fruit: it possessed probably strong medicinal powers,\r\nimparting gladness to the heart and vigour to the limbs; but its effects\r\nwould wear out; already were they diminished in my frame. I was a lucky\r\nfellow to have quaffed health and joyous spirits, and perhaps long life,\r\nat my master\u2019s hands; but my good fortune ended there: longevity was far\r\ndifferent from immortality.\r\n\r\nI continued to entertain this belief for many years. Sometimes a thought\r\nstole across me\u2014Was the alchymist indeed deceived? But my habitual\r\ncredence was, that I should meet the fate of all the children of Adam at\r\nmy appointed time\u2014a little late, but still at a natural age. Yet it was\r\ncertain that I retained a wonderfully youthful look. I was laughed at\r\nfor my vanity in consulting the mirror so often, but I consulted it in\r\nvain\u2014my brow was untrenched\u2014my cheeks\u2014my eyes\u2014my whole person continued\r\nas untarnished as in my twentieth year.\r\n\r\nI was troubled. I looked at the faded beauty of Bertha\u2014I seemed more\r\nlike her son. By degrees our neighbours began to make similar\r\nobservations, and I found at last that I went by the name of the Scholar\r\nbewitched. Bertha herself grew uneasy. She became jealous and peevish,\r\nand at length she began to question me. We had no children; we were all\r\nin all to each other; and though, as she grew older, her vivacious\r\nspirit became a little allied to ill-temper, and her beauty sadly\r\ndiminished, I cherished her in my heart as the mistress I had idolized,\r\nthe wife I had sought and won with such perfect love.\r\n\r\nAt last our situation became intolerable: Bertha was fifty\u2014I twenty\r\nyears of age. I had, in very shame, in some measure adopted the habits\r\nof a more advanced age; I no longer mingled in the dance among the young\r\nand gay, but my heart bounded along with them while I restrained my\r\nfeet; and a sorry figure I cut among the Nestors of our village. But\r\nbefore the time I mention, things were altered\u2014we were universally\r\nshunned; we were\u2014at least, I was\u2014reported to have kept up an iniquitous\r\nacquaintance with some of my former master\u2019s supposed friends. Poor\r\nBertha was pitied, but deserted. I was regarded with horror and\r\ndetestation.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done? we sat by our winter fire\u2014poverty had made itself\r\nfelt, for none would buy the produce of my farm; and often I had been\r\nforced to journey twenty miles, to some place where I was not known, to\r\ndispose of our property. It is true, we had saved something for an evil\r\nday\u2014that day was come.\r\n\r\nWe sat by our lone fireside\u2014the old-hearted youth and his antiquated\r\nwife. Again Bertha insisted on knowing the truth; she recapitulated all\r\nshe had ever heard said about me, and added her own observations. She\r\nconjured me to cast off the spell; she described how much more comely\r\ngrey hairs were than my chestnut locks; she descanted on the reverence\r\nand respect due to age\u2014how preferable to the slight regard paid to mere\r\nchildren: could I imagine that the despicable gifts of youth and good\r\nlooks outweighed disgrace, hatred, and scorn? Nay, in the end I should\r\nbe burnt as a dealer in the black art, while she, to whom I had not\r\ndeigned to communicate any portion of my good fortune, might be stoned\r\nas my accomplice. At length she insinuated that I must share my secret\r\nwith her, and bestow on her like benefits to those I myself enjoyed, or\r\nshe would denounce me\u2014and then she burst into tears.\r\n\r\nThus beset, methought it was the best way to tell the truth. I revealed\r\nit as tenderly as I could, and spoke only of a _very long life_, not of\r\nimmortality\u2014which representation, indeed, coincided best with my own\r\nideas. When I ended, I rose and said,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now, my Bertha, will you denounce the lover of your youth?\u2014You will\r\nnot, I know. But it is too hard, my poor wife, that you should suffer\r\nfrom my ill-luck and the accursed arts of Cornelius. I will leave\r\nyou\u2014you have wealth enough, and friends will return in my absence. I\r\nwill go; young as I seem, and strong as I am, I can work and gain my\r\nbread among strangers, unsuspected and unknown. I loved you in youth;\r\nGod is my witness that I would not desert you in age, but that your\r\nsafety and happiness require it.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took my cap and moved towards the door; in a moment Bertha\u2019s arms were\r\nround my neck, and her lips were pressed to mine. \u201cNo, my husband, my\r\nWinzy,\u201d she said, \u201cyou shall not go alone\u2014take me with you; we will\r\nremove from this place, and, as you say, among strangers we shall be\r\nunsuspected and safe. I am not so very old as quite to shame you, my\r\nWinzy; and I daresay the charm will soon wear off, and, with the\r\nblessing of God, you will become more elderly-looking, as is fitting;\r\nyou shall not leave me.\u201d\r\n\r\nI returned the good soul\u2019s embrace heartily. \u201cI will not, my Bertha; but\r\nfor your sake I had not thought of such a thing. I will be your true,\r\nfaithful husband while you are spared to me, and do my duty by you to\r\nthe last.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe next day we prepared secretly for our emigration. We were obliged to\r\nmake great pecuniary sacrifices\u2014it could not be helped. We realized a\r\nsum sufficient, at least, to maintain us while Bertha lived; and,\r\nwithout saying adieu to any one, quitted our native country to take\r\nrefuge in a remote part of western France.\r\n\r\nIt was a cruel thing to transport poor Bertha from her native village,\r\nand the friends of her youth, to a new country, new language, new\r\ncustoms. The strange secret of my destiny rendered this removal\r\nimmaterial to me; but I compassionated her deeply, and was glad to\r\nperceive that she found compensation for her misfortunes in a variety of\r\nlittle ridiculous circumstances. Away from all tell-tale chroniclers,\r\nshe sought to decrease the apparent disparity of our ages by a thousand\r\nfeminine arts\u2014rouge, youthful dress, and assumed juvenility of manner. I\r\ncould not be angry. Did not I myself wear a mask? Why quarrel with hers,\r\nbecause it was less successful? I grieved deeply when I remembered that\r\nthis was my Bertha, whom I had loved so fondly, and won with such\r\ntransport\u2014the dark-eyed, dark-haired girl, with smiles of enchanting\r\narchness and a step like a fawn\u2014this mincing, simpering, jealous old\r\nwoman. I should have revered her grey locks and withered cheeks; but\r\nthus!\u2014It was my work, I knew; but I did not the less deplore this type\r\nof human weakness.\r\n\r\nHer jealousy never slept. Her chief occupation was to discover that, in\r\nspite of outward appearances, I was myself growing old. I verily believe\r\nthat the poor soul loved me truly in her heart, but never had woman so\r\ntormenting a mode of displaying fondness. She would discern wrinkles in\r\nmy face and decrepitude in my walk, while I bounded along in youthful\r\nvigour, the youngest looking of twenty youths. I never dared address\r\nanother woman. On one occasion, fancying that the belle of the village\r\nregarded me with favouring eyes, she brought me a grey wig. Her constant\r\ndiscourse among her acquaintances was, that though I looked so young,\r\nthere was ruin at work within my frame; and she affirmed that the worst\r\nsymptom about me was my apparent health. My youth was a disease, she\r\nsaid, and I ought at all times to prepare, if not for a sudden and awful\r\ndeath, at least to awake some morning white-headed and bowed down with\r\nall the marks of advanced years. I let her talk\u2014I often joined in her\r\nconjectures. Her warnings chimed in with my never-ceasing speculations\r\nconcerning my state, and I took an earnest, though painful, interest in\r\nlistening to all that her quick wit and excited imagination could say on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nWhy dwell on these minute circumstances? We lived on for many long\r\nyears. Bertha became bedrid and paralytic; I nursed her as a mother\r\nmight a child. She grew peevish, and still harped upon one string\u2014of how\r\nlong I should survive her. It has ever been a source of consolation to\r\nme, that I performed my duty scrupulously towards her. She had been mine\r\nin youth, she was mine in age; and at last, when I heaped the sod over\r\nher corpse, I wept to feel that I had lost all that really bound me to\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nSince then how many have been my cares and woes, how few and empty my\r\nenjoyments! I pause here in my history\u2014I will pursue it no further. A\r\nsailor without rudder or compass, tossed on a stormy sea\u2014a traveller\r\nlost on a widespread heath, without landmark or stone to guide him\u2014such\r\nhave I been: more lost, more hopeless than either. A nearing ship, a\r\ngleam from some far cot, may save them; but I have no beacon except the\r\nhope of death.\r\n\r\nDeath! mysterious, ill-visaged friend of weak humanity! Why alone of all\r\nmortals have you cast me from your sheltering fold? Oh, for the peace of\r\nthe grave! the deep silence of the iron-bound tomb! that thought would\r\ncease to work in my brain, and my heart beat no more with emotions\r\nvaried only by new forms of sadness!\r\n\r\nAm I immortal? I return to my first question. In the first place, is it\r\nnot more probable that the beverage of the alchymist was fraught rather\r\nwith longevity than eternal life? Such is my hope. And then be it\r\nremembered, that I only drank _half_ of the potion prepared by him. Was\r\nnot the whole necessary to complete the charm? To have drained half the\r\nElixir of Immortality is but to be half-immortal\u2014my For-ever is thus\r\ntruncated and null.\r\n\r\nBut again, who shall number the years of the half of eternity? I often\r\ntry to imagine by what rule the infinite may be divided. Sometimes I\r\nfancy age advancing upon me. One grey hair I have found. Fool! do I\r\nlament? Yes, the fear of age and death often creeps coldly into my\r\nheart; and the more I live, the more I dread death, even while I abhor\r\nlife. Such an enigma is man\u2014born to perish\u2014when he wars, as I do,\r\nagainst the established laws of his nature.\r\n\r\nBut for this anomaly of feeling surely I might die: the medicine of the\r\nalchymist would not be proof against fire\u2014sword\u2014and the strangling\r\nwaters. I have gazed upon the blue depths of many a placid lake, and the\r\ntumultuous rushing of many a mighty river, and have said, peace inhabits\r\nthose waters; yet I have turned my steps away, to live yet another day.\r\nI have asked myself, whether suicide would be a crime in one to whom\r\nthus only the portals of the other world could be opened. I have done\r\nall, except presenting myself as a soldier or duellist, an object of\r\ndestruction to my\u2014no, _not_ my fellow-mortals, and therefore I have\r\nshrunk away. They are not my fellows. The inextinguishable power of life\r\nin my frame, and their ephemeral existence, places us wide as the poles\r\nasunder. I could not raise a hand against the meanest or the most\r\npowerful among them.\r\n\r\nThus I have lived on for many a year\u2014alone, and weary of myself\u2014desirous\r\nof death, yet never dying\u2014a mortal immortal. Neither ambition nor\r\navarice can enter my mind, and the ardent love that gnaws at my heart,\r\nnever to be returned\u2014never to find an equal on which to expend\r\nitself\u2014lives there only to torment me.\r\n\r\nThis very day I conceived a design by which I may end all\u2014without\r\nself-slaughter, without making another man a Cain\u2014an expedition, which\r\nmortal frame can never survive, even endued with the youth and strength\r\nthat inhabits mine. Thus I shall put my immortality to the test, and\r\nrest for ever\u2014or return, the wonder and benefactor of the human species.\r\n\r\nBefore I go, a miserable vanity has caused me to pen these pages. I\r\nwould not die, and leave no name behind. Three centuries have passed\r\nsince I quaffed the fatal beverage; another year shall not elapse\r\nbefore, encountering gigantic dangers\u2014warring with the powers of frost\r\nin their home\u2014beset by famine, toil, and tempest\u2014I yield this body, too\r\ntenacious a cage for a soul which thirsts for freedom, to the\r\ndestructive elements of air and water; or, if I survive, my name shall\r\nbe recorded as one of the most famous among the sons of men; and, my\r\ntask achieved, I shall adopt more resolute means, and, by scattering and\r\nannihilating the atoms that compose my frame, set at liberty the life\r\nimprisoned within, and so cruelly prevented from soaring from this dim\r\nearth to a sphere more congenial to its immortal essence.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IX.\r\n\r\n                           _TRANSFORMATION._\r\n\r\n              \u201cForthwith this frame of mine was wrench\u2019d\r\n                  With a woful agony,\r\n               Which forced me to begin my tale,\r\n                  And then it set me free.\r\n\r\n              \u201cSince then, at an uncertain hour,\r\n                 That agony returns;\r\n               And till my ghastly tale is told\r\n                 This heart within me burns.\u201d\r\n                             \u2014COLERIDGE\u2019S ANCIENT MARINER.\r\n\r\n\r\nI HAVE heard it said, that, when any strange, supernatural, and\r\nnecromantic adventure has occurred to a human being, that being, however\r\ndesirous he may be to conceal the same, feels at certain periods torn up\r\nas it were by an intellectual earthquake, and is forced to bare the\r\ninner depths of his spirit to another. I am a witness of the truth of\r\nthis. I have dearly sworn to myself never to reveal to human ears the\r\nhorrors to which I once, in excess of fiendly pride, delivered myself\r\nover. The holy man who heard my confession, and reconciled me to the\r\nChurch, is dead. None knows that once\u2014\r\n\r\nWhy should it not be thus? Why tell a tale of impious tempting of\r\nProvidence, and soul-subduing humiliation? Why? answer me, ye who are\r\nwise in the secrets of human nature! I only know that so it is; and in\r\nspite of strong resolve,\u2014of a pride that too much masters me\u2014of shame,\r\nand even of fear, so to render myself odious to my species,\u2014I must\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nGenoa! my birthplace\u2014proud city! looking upon the blue\r\nMediterranean\u2014dost thou remember me in my boyhood, when thy cliffs and\r\npromontories, thy bright sky and gay vineyards, were my world? Happy\r\ntime! when to the young heart the narrow-bounded universe, which leaves,\r\nby its very limitation, free scope to the imagination, enchains our\r\nphysical energies, and, sole period in our lives, innocence and\r\nenjoyment are united. Yet, who can look back to childhood, and not\r\nremember its sorrows and its harrowing fears? I was born with the most\r\nimperious, haughty, tameless spirit. I quailed before my father only;\r\nand he, generous and noble, but capricious and tyrannical, at once\r\nfostered and checked the wild impetuosity of my character, making\r\nobedience necessary, but inspiring no respect for the motives which\r\nguided his commands. To be a man, free, independent; or, in better\r\nwords, insolent and domineering, was the hope and prayer of my rebel\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nMy father had one friend, a wealthy Genoese noble, who in a political\r\ntumult was suddenly sentenced to banishment, and his property\r\nconfiscated. The Marchese Torella went into exile alone. Like my father,\r\nhe was a widower: he had one child, the almost infant Juliet, who was\r\nleft under my father\u2019s guardianship. I should certainly have been unkind\r\nto the lovely girl, but that I was forced by my position to become her\r\nprotector. A variety of childish incidents all tended to one point,\u2014to\r\nmake Juliet see in me a rock of defence; I in her, one who must perish\r\nthrough the soft sensibility of her nature too rudely visited, but for\r\nmy guardian care. We grew up together. The opening rose in May was not\r\nmore sweet than this dear girl. An irradiation of beauty was spread over\r\nher face. Her form, her step, her voice\u2014my heart weeps even now, to\r\nthink of all of relying, gentle, loving, and pure, that she enshrined.\r\nWhen I was eleven and Juliet eight years of age, a cousin of mine, much\r\nolder than either\u2014he seemed to us a man\u2014took great notice of my\r\nplaymate; he called her his bride, and asked her to marry him. She\r\nrefused, and he insisted, drawing her unwillingly towards him. With the\r\ncountenance and emotions of a maniac I threw myself on him\u2014I strove to\r\ndraw his sword\u2014I clung to his neck with the ferocious resolve to\r\nstrangle him: he was obliged to call for assistance to disengage himself\r\nfrom me. On that night I led Juliet to the chapel of our house: I made\r\nher touch the sacred relics\u2014I harrowed her child\u2019s heart, and profaned\r\nher child\u2019s lips with an oath, that she would be mine, and mine only.\r\n\r\nWell, those days passed away. Torella returned in a few years, and\r\nbecame wealthier and more prosperous than ever. When I was seventeen, my\r\nfather died; he had been magnificent to prodigality; Torella rejoiced\r\nthat my minority would afford an opportunity for repairing my fortunes.\r\nJuliet and I had been affianced beside my father\u2019s deathbed\u2014Torella was\r\nto be a second parent to me.\r\n\r\nI desired to see the world, and I was indulged. I went to Florence, to\r\nRome, to Naples; thence I passed to Toulon, and at length reached what\r\nhad long been the bourne of my wishes, Paris. There was wild work in\r\nParis then. The poor king, Charles the Sixth, now sane, now mad, now a\r\nmonarch, now an abject slave, was the very mockery of humanity. The\r\nqueen, the dauphin, the Duke of Burgundy, alternately friends and\r\nfoes,\u2014now meeting in prodigal feasts, now shedding blood in\r\nrivalry,\u2014were blind to the miserable state of their country, and the\r\ndangers that impended over it, and gave themselves wholly up to\r\ndissolute enjoyment or savage strife. My character still followed me. I\r\nwas arrogant and self-willed; I loved display, and above all, I threw\r\noff all control. My young friends were eager to foster passions which\r\nfurnished them with pleasures. I was deemed handsome\u2014I was master of\r\nevery knightly accomplishment. I was disconnected with any political\r\nparty. I grew a favourite with all: my presumption and arrogance was\r\npardoned in one so young: I became a spoiled child. Who could control\r\nme? not the letters and advice of Torella\u2014only strong necessity visiting\r\nme in the abhorred shape of an empty purse. But there were means to\r\nrefill this void. Acre after acre, estate after estate, I sold. My\r\ndress, my jewels, my horses and their caparisons, were almost unrivalled\r\nin gorgeous Paris, while the lands of my inheritance passed into\r\npossession of others.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Orleans was waylaid and murdered by the Duke of Burgundy.\r\nFear and terror possessed all Paris. The dauphin and the queen shut\r\nthemselves up; every pleasure was suspended. I grew weary of this state\r\nof things, and my heart yearned for my boyhood\u2019s haunts. I was nearly a\r\nbeggar, yet still I would go there, claim my bride, and rebuild my\r\nfortunes. A few happy ventures as a merchant would make me rich again.\r\nNevertheless, I would not return in humble guise. My last act was to\r\ndispose of my remaining estate near Albaro for half its worth, for ready\r\nmoney. Then I despatched all kinds of artificers, arras, furniture of\r\nregal splendour, to fit up the last relic of my inheritance, my palace\r\nin Genoa. I lingered a little longer yet, ashamed at the part of the\r\nprodigal returned, which I feared I should play. I sent my horses. One\r\nmatchless Spanish jennet I despatched to my promised bride: its\r\ncaparisons flamed with jewels and cloth of gold. In every part I caused\r\nto be entwined the initials of Juliet and her Guido. My present found\r\nfavour in hers and in her father\u2019s eyes.\r\n\r\nStill to return a proclaimed spendthrift, the mark of impertinent\r\nwonder, perhaps of scorn, and to encounter singly the reproaches or\r\ntaunts of my fellow-citizens, was no alluring prospect. As a shield\r\nbetween me and censure, I invited some few of the most reckless of my\r\ncomrades to accompany me: thus I went armed against the world, hiding a\r\nrankling feeling, half fear and half penitence, by bravado.\r\n\r\nI arrived in Genoa. I trod the pavement of my ancestral palace. My proud\r\nstep was no interpreter of my heart, for I deeply felt that, though\r\nsurrounded by every luxury, I was a beggar. The first step I took in\r\nclaiming Juliet must widely declare me such. I read contempt or pity in\r\nthe looks of all. I fancied that rich and poor, young and old, all\r\nregarded me with derision. Torella came not near me. No wonder that my\r\nsecond father should expect a son\u2019s deference from me in waiting first\r\non him. But, galled and stung by a sense of my follies and demerit, I\r\nstrove to throw the blame on others. We kept nightly orgies in Palazzo\r\nCarega. To sleepless, riotous nights followed listless, supine mornings.\r\nAt the Ave Maria we showed our dainty persons in the streets, scoffing\r\nat the sober citizens, casting insolent glances on the shrinking women.\r\nJuliet was not among them\u2014no, no; if she had been there, shame would\r\nhave driven me away, if love had not brought me to her feet.\r\n\r\nI grew tired of this. Suddenly I paid the Marchese a visit. He was at\r\nhis villa, one among the many which deck the suburb of San Pietro\r\nd\u2019Arena. It was the month of May, the blossoms of the fruit-trees were\r\nfading among thick, green foliage; the vines were shooting forth; the\r\nground strewed with the fallen olive blooms; the firefly was in the\r\nmyrtle hedge; heaven and earth wore a mantle of surpassing beauty.\r\nTorella welcomed me kindly, though seriously; and even his shade of\r\ndispleasure soon wore away. Some resemblance to my father\u2014some look and\r\ntone of youthful ingenuousness, softened the good old man\u2019s heart. He\r\nsent for his daughter\u2014he presented me to her as her betrothed. The\r\nchamber became hallowed by a holy light as she entered. Hers was that\r\ncherub look, those large, soft eyes, full dimpled cheeks, and mouth of\r\ninfantine sweetness, that expresses the rare union of happiness and\r\nlove. Admiration first possessed me; she is mine! was the second proud\r\nemotion, and my lips curled with haughty triumph. I had not been the\r\n_enfant g\u00e2t\u00e9_ of the beauties of France not to have learnt the art of\r\npleasing the soft heart of woman. If towards men I was overbearing, the\r\ndeference I paid to them was the more in contrast. I commenced my\r\ncourtship by the display of a thousand gallantries to Juliet, who, vowed\r\nto me from infancy, had never admitted the devotion of others; and who,\r\nthough accustomed to expressions of admiration, was uninitiated in the\r\nlanguage of lovers.\r\n\r\nFor a few days all went well. Torella never alluded to my extravagance;\r\nhe treated me as a favourite son. But the time came, as we discussed the\r\npreliminaries to my union with his daughter, when this fair face of\r\nthings should be overcast. A contract had been drawn up in my father\u2019s\r\nlifetime. I had rendered this, in fact, void by having squandered the\r\nwhole of the wealth which was to have been shared by Juliet and myself.\r\nTorella, in consequence, chose to consider this bond as cancelled, and\r\nproposed another, in which, though the wealth he bestowed was\r\nimmeasurably increased, there were so many restrictions as to the mode\r\nof spending it, that I, who saw independence only in free career being\r\ngiven to my own imperious will, taunted him as taking advantage of my\r\nsituation, and refused utterly to subscribe to his conditions. The old\r\nman mildly strove to recall me to reason. Roused pride became the tyrant\r\nof my thought: I listened with indignation\u2014I repelled him with disdain.\r\n\r\n\u201cJuliet, thou art mine! Did we not interchange vows in our innocent\r\nchildhood? Are we not one in the sight of God? and shall thy\r\ncold-hearted, cold-blooded father divide us? Be generous, my love, be\r\njust; take not away a gift, last treasure of thy Guido\u2014retract not thy\r\nvows\u2014let us defy the world, and, setting at nought the calculations of\r\nage, find in our mutual affection a refuge from every ill.\u201d\r\n\r\nFiend I must have been with such sophistry to endeavour to poison that\r\nsanctuary of holy thought and tender love. Juliet shrank from me\r\naffrighted. Her father was the best and kindest of men, and she strove\r\nto show me how, in obeying him, every good would follow. He would\r\nreceive my tardy submission with warm affection, and generous pardon\r\nwould follow my repentance;\u2014profitless words for a young and gentle\r\ndaughter to use to a man accustomed to make his will law, and to feel in\r\nhis own heart a despot so terrible and stern that he could yield\r\nobedience to nought save his own imperious desires! My resentment grew\r\nwith resistance; my wild companions were ready to add fuel to the flame.\r\nWe laid a plan to carry off Juliet. At first it appeared to be crowned\r\nwith success. Midway, on our return, we were overtaken by the agonized\r\nfather and his attendants. A conflict ensued. Before the city guard came\r\nto decide the victory in favour of our antagonists, two of Torella\u2019s\r\nservitors were dangerously wounded.\r\n\r\nThis portion of my history weighs most heavily with me. Changed man as I\r\nam, I abhor myself in the recollection. May none who hear this tale ever\r\nhave felt as I. A horse driven to fury by a rider armed with barbed\r\nspurs was not more a slave than I to the violent tyranny of my temper. A\r\nfiend possessed my soul, irritating it to madness. I felt the voice of\r\nconscience within me; but if I yielded to it for a brief interval, it\r\nwas only to be a moment after torn, as by a whirlwind, away\u2014borne along\r\non the stream of desperate rage\u2014the plaything of the storms engendered\r\nby pride. I was imprisoned, and, at the instance of Torella, set free.\r\nAgain I returned to carry off both him and his child to France, which\r\nhapless country, then preyed on by freebooters and gangs of lawless\r\nsoldiery, offered a grateful refuge to a criminal like me. Our plots\r\nwere discovered. I was sentenced to banishment; and, as my debts were\r\nalready enormous, my remaining property was put in the hands of\r\ncommissioners for their payment. Torella again offered his mediation,\r\nrequiring only my promise not to renew my abortive attempts on himself\r\nand his daughter. I spurned his offers, and fancied that I triumphed\r\nwhen I was thrust out from Genoa, a solitary and penniless exile. My\r\ncompanions were gone: they had been dismissed the city some weeks\r\nbefore, and were already in France. I was alone\u2014friendless, with neither\r\nsword at my side, nor ducat in my purse.\r\n\r\nI wandered along the sea-shore, a whirlwind of passion possessing and\r\ntearing my soul. It was as if a live coal had been set burning in my\r\nbreast. At first I meditated on what _I should do_. I would join a band\r\nof freebooters. Revenge!\u2014the word seemed balm to me; I hugged it,\r\ncaressed it, till, like a serpent, it stung me. Then again I would\r\nabjure and despise Genoa, that little corner of the world. I would\r\nreturn to Paris, where so many of my friends swarmed; where my services\r\nwould be eagerly accepted; where I would carve out fortune with my\r\nsword, and make my paltry birthplace and the false Torella rue the day\r\nwhen they drove me, a new Coriolanus, from her walls. I would return to\r\nParis\u2014thus on foot\u2014a beggar\u2014and present myself in my poverty to those I\r\nhad formerly entertained sumptuously? There was gall in the mere thought\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThe reality of things began to dawn upon my mind, bringing despair in\r\nits train. For several months I had been a prisoner: the evils of my\r\ndungeon had whipped my soul to madness, but they had subdued my\r\ncorporeal frame. I was weak and wan. Torella had used a thousand\r\nartifices to administer to my comfort; I had detected and scorned them\r\nall, and I reaped the harvest of my obduracy. What was to be done?\r\nShould I crouch before my foe, and sue for forgiveness?\u2014Die rather ten\r\nthousand deaths!\u2014Never should they obtain that victory! Hate\u2014I swore\r\neternal hate! Hate from whom?\u2014to whom?\u2014From a wandering outcast\u2014to a\r\nmighty noble! I and my feelings were nothing to them: already had they\r\nforgotten one so unworthy. And Juliet!\u2014her angel face and sylph-like\r\nform gleamed among the clouds of my despair with vain beauty; for I had\r\nlost her\u2014the glory and flower of the world! Another will call her\r\nhis!\u2014that smile of paradise will bless another!\r\n\r\nEven now my heart fails within me when I recur to this rout of\r\ngrim-visaged ideas. Now subdued almost to tears, now raving in my agony,\r\nstill I wandered along the rocky shore, which grew at each step wilder\r\nand more desolate. Hanging rocks and hoar precipices overlooked the\r\ntideless ocean; black caverns yawned; and for ever, among the seaworn\r\nrecesses, murmured and dashed the unfruitful waters. Now my way was\r\nalmost barred by an abrupt promontory, now rendered nearly impracticable\r\nby fragments fallen from the cliff. Evening was at hand, when, seaward,\r\narose, as if on the waving of a wizard\u2019s wand, a murky web of clouds,\r\nblotting the late azure sky, and darkening and disturbing the till now\r\nplacid deep. The clouds had strange, fantastic shapes, and they changed\r\nand mingled and seemed to be driven about by a mighty spell. The waves\r\nraised their white crests; the thunder first muttered, then roared from\r\nacross the waste of waters, which took a deep purple dye, flecked with\r\nfoam. The spot where I stood looked, on one side, to the widespread\r\nocean; on the other, it was barred by a rugged promontory. Round this\r\ncape suddenly came, driven by the wind, a vessel. In vain the mariners\r\ntried to force a path for her to the open sea\u2014the gale drove her on the\r\nrocks. It will perish!\u2014all on board will perish! Would I were among\r\nthem! And to my young heart the idea of death came for the first time\r\nblended with that of joy. It was an awful sight to behold that vessel\r\nstruggling with her fate. Hardly could I discern the sailors, but I\r\nheard them. It was soon all over! A rock, just covered by the tossing\r\nwaves, and so unperceived, lay in wait for its prey. A crash of thunder\r\nbroke over my head at the moment that, with a frightful shock, the\r\nvessel dashed upon her unseen enemy. In a brief space of time she went\r\nto pieces. There I stood in safety; and there were my fellow-creatures\r\nbattling, how hopelessly, with annihilation. Methought I saw them\r\nstruggling\u2014too truly did I hear their shrieks, conquering the barking\r\nsurges in their shrill agony. The dark breakers threw hither and thither\r\nthe fragments of the wreck: soon it disappeared. I had been fascinated\r\nto gaze till the end: at last I sank on my knees\u2014I covered my face with\r\nmy hands. I again looked up; something was floating on the billows\r\ntowards the shore. It neared and neared. Was that a human form? It grew\r\nmore and more distinct; and at last a mighty wave, lifting the whole\r\nfreight, lodged it upon a rock. A human being bestriding a sea-chest!\u2014a\r\nhuman being! Yet was it one? Surely never such had existed before\u2014a\r\nmisshapen dwarf, with squinting eyes, distorted features, and body\r\ndeformed, till it became a horror to behold. My blood, lately warming\r\ntowards a fellow-being so snatched from a watery tomb, froze in my\r\nheart. The dwarf got off his chest; he tossed his straight, struggling\r\nhair from his odious visage.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy St. Beelzebub!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cI have been well bested.\u201d He looked\r\nround and saw me. \u201cOh, by the fiend! here is another ally of the mighty\r\nOne. To what saint did you offer prayers, friend\u2014if not to mine? Yet I\r\nremember you not on board.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shrank from the monster and his blasphemy. Again he questioned me, and\r\nI muttered some inaudible reply. He continued:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYour voice is drowned by this dissonant roar. What a noise the big\r\nocean makes! Schoolboys bursting from their prison are not louder than\r\nthese waves set free to play. They disturb me. I will no more of their\r\nill-timed brawling. Silence, hoary One!\u2014Winds, avaunt!\u2014to your\r\nhomes!\u2014Clouds, fly to the antipodes, and leave our heaven clear!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he stretched out his two long, lank arms, that looked like\r\nspider\u2019s claws, and seemed to embrace with them the expanse before him.\r\nWas it a miracle? The clouds became broken and fled; the azure sky first\r\npeeped out, and then was spread a calm field of blue above us; the\r\nstormy gale was exchanged to the softly breathing west; the sea grew\r\ncalm; the waves dwindled to riplets.\r\n\r\n\u201cI like obedience even in these stupid elements,\u201d said the dwarf. \u201cHow\r\nmuch more in the tameless mind of man! It was a well-got-up storm, you\r\nmust allow\u2014and all of my own making.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was tempting Providence to interchange talk with this magician. But\r\n_Power_, in all its shapes, is respected by man. Awe, curiosity, a\r\nclinging fascination, drew me towards him.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, don\u2019t be frightened, friend,\u201d said the wretch: \u201cI am\r\ngood-humoured when pleased; and something does please me in your\r\nwell-proportioned body and handsome face, though you look a little\r\nwoe-begone. You have suffered a land\u2014I, a sea wreck. Perhaps I can allay\r\nthe tempest of your fortunes as I did my own. Shall we be friends?\u201d\u2014And\r\nhe held out his hand; I could not touch it. \u201cWell, then, companions\u2014that\r\nwill do as well. And now, while I rest after the buffeting I underwent\r\njust now, tell me why, young and gallant as you seem, you wander thus\r\nalone and downcast on this wild sea-shore.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe voice of the wretch was screeching and horrid, and his contortions\r\nas he spoke were frightful to behold. Yet he did gain a kind of\r\ninfluence over me, which I could not master, and I told him my tale.\r\nWhen it was ended, he laughed long and loud: the rocks echoed back the\r\nsound: hell seemed yelling around me.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, thou cousin of Lucifer!\u201d said he; \u201cso thou too hast fallen through\r\nthy pride; and, though bright as the son of Morning, thou art ready to\r\ngive up thy good looks, thy bride, and thy well-being, rather than\r\nsubmit thee to the tyranny of good. I honour thy choice, by my soul!\u2014So\r\nthou hast fled, and yield the day; and mean to starve on these rocks,\r\nand to let the birds peck out thy dead eyes, while thy enemy and thy\r\nbetrothed rejoice in thy ruin. Thy pride is strangely akin to humility,\r\nmethinks.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, a thousand fanged thoughts stung me to the heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat would you that I should do?\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cI!\u2014Oh, nothing, but lie down and say your prayers before you die. But,\r\nwere I you, I know the deed that should be done.\u201d\r\n\r\nI drew near him. His supernatural powers made him an oracle in my eyes;\r\nyet a strange unearthly thrill quivered through my frame as I said,\r\n\u201cSpeak!\u2014teach me\u2014what act do you advise?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRevenge thyself, man!\u2014humble thy enemies!\u2014set thy foot on the old man\u2019s\r\nneck, and possess thyself of his daughter!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the east and west I turn,\u201d cried I, \u201cand see no means! Had I gold,\r\nmuch could I achieve; but, poor and single, I am powerless.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dwarf had been seated on his chest as he listened to my story. Now\r\nhe got off; he touched a spring; it flew open! What a mine of wealth\u2014of\r\nblazing jewels, beaming gold, and pale silver\u2014was displayed therein. A\r\nmad desire to possess this treasure was born within me.\r\n\r\n\u201cDoubtless,\u201d I said, \u201cone so powerful as you could do all things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay,\u201d said the monster humbly, \u201cI am less omnipotent than I seem. Some\r\nthings I possess which you may covet; but I would give them all for a\r\nsmall share, or even for a loan of what is yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy possessions are at your service,\u201d I replied bitterly\u2014\u201cmy poverty, my\r\nexile, my disgrace\u2014I make a free gift of them all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood! I thank you. Add one other thing to your gift, and my treasure is\r\nyours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs nothing is my sole inheritance, what besides nothing would you\r\nhave?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour comely face and well-made limbs.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shivered. Would this all-powerful monster murder me? I had no dagger.\r\nI forgot to pray\u2014but I grew pale.\r\n\r\n\u201cI ask for a loan, not a gift,\u201d said the frightful thing: \u201clend me your\r\nbody for three days\u2014you shall have mine to cage your soul the while,\r\nand, in payment, my chest. What say you to the bargain?\u2014Three short\r\ndays.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe are told that it is dangerous to hold unlawful talk; and well do I\r\nprove the same. Tamely written down, it may seem incredible that I\r\nshould lend any ear to this proposition; but, in spite of his unnatural\r\nugliness, there was something fascinating in a being whose voice could\r\ngovern earth, air, and sea. I felt a keen desire to comply; for with\r\nthat chest I could command the worlds. My only hesitation resulted from\r\na fear that he would not be true to his bargain. Then, I thought, I\r\nshall soon die here on these lonely sands, and the limbs he covets will\r\nbe mine no more:\u2014it is worth the chance. And, besides, I knew that, by\r\nall the rules of art-magic, there were formula and oaths which none of\r\nits practisers dared break. I hesitated to reply; and he went on, now\r\ndisplaying his wealth, now speaking of the petty price he demanded, till\r\nit seemed madness to refuse. Thus is it;\u2014place our bark in the current\r\nof the stream, and down, over fall and cataract it is hurried; give up\r\nour conduct to the wild torrent of passion, and we are away, we know not\r\nwhither.\r\n\r\nHe swore many an oath, and I adjured him by many a sacred name; till I\r\nsaw this wonder of power, this ruler of the elements, shiver like an\r\nautumn leaf before my words; and as if the spirit spake unwillingly and\r\nperforce within him, at last, he, with broken voice, revealed the spell\r\nwhereby he might be obliged, did he wish to play me false, to render up\r\nthe unlawful spoil. Our warm life-blood must mingle to make and to mar\r\nthe charm.\r\n\r\nEnough of this unholy theme. I was persuaded\u2014the thing was done. The\r\nmorrow dawned upon me as I lay upon the shingles, and I knew not my own\r\nshadow as it fell from me. I felt myself changed to a shape of horror,\r\nand cursed my easy faith and blind credulity. The chest was there\u2014there\r\nthe gold and precious stones for which I had sold the frame of flesh\r\nwhich nature had given me. The sight a little stilled my emotions: three\r\ndays would soon be gone.\r\n\r\nThey did pass. The dwarf had supplied me with a plenteous store of food.\r\nAt first I could hardly walk, so strange and out of joint were all my\r\nlimbs; and my voice\u2014it was that of the fiend. But I kept silent, and\r\nturned my face to the sun, that I might not see my shadow, and counted\r\nthe hours, and ruminated on my future conduct. To bring Torella to my\r\nfeet\u2014to possess my Juliet in spite of him\u2014all this my wealth could\r\neasily achieve. During dark night I slept, and dreamt of the\r\naccomplishment of my desires. Two suns had set\u2014the third dawned. I was\r\nagitated, fearful. Oh expectation, what a frightful thing art thou, when\r\nkindled more by fear than hope! How dost thou twist thyself round the\r\nheart, torturing its pulsations! How dost thou dart unknown pangs all\r\nthrough our feeble mechanism, now seeming to shiver us like broken\r\nglass, to nothingness\u2014now giving us a fresh strength, which can _do_\r\nnothing, and so torments us by a sensation, such as the strong man must\r\nfeel who cannot break his fetters, though they bend in his grasp. Slowly\r\npaced the bright, bright orb up the eastern sky; long it lingered in the\r\nzenith, and still more slowly wandered down the west: it touched the\r\nhorizon\u2019s verge\u2014it was lost! Its glories were on the summits of the\r\ncliff\u2014they grew dun and grey. The evening star shone bright. He will\r\nsoon be here.\r\n\r\nHe came not!\u2014By the living heavens, he came not!\u2014and night dragged out\r\nits weary length, and, in its decaying age, \u201cday began to grizzle its\r\ndark hair;\u201d and the sun rose again on the most miserable wretch that\r\never upbraided its light. Three days thus I passed. The jewels and the\r\ngold\u2014oh, how I abhorred them!\r\n\r\nWell, well\u2014I will not blacken these pages with demoniac ravings. All too\r\nterrible were the thoughts, the raging tumult of ideas that filled my\r\nsoul. At the end of that time I slept; I had not before since the third\r\nsunset; and I dreamt that I was at Juliet\u2019s feet, and she smiled, and\r\nthen she shrieked\u2014for she saw my transformation\u2014and again she smiled,\r\nfor still her beautiful lover knelt before her. But it was not I\u2014it was\r\nhe, the fiend, arrayed in my limbs, speaking with my voice, winning her\r\nwith my looks of love. I strove to warn her, but my tongue refused its\r\noffice; I strove to tear him from her, but I was rooted to the ground\u2014I\r\nawoke with the agony. There were the solitary hoar precipices\u2014there the\r\nplashing sea, the quiet strand, and the blue sky over all. What did it\r\nmean? was my dream but a mirror of the truth? was he wooing and winning\r\nmy betrothed? I would on the instant back to Genoa\u2014but I was banished. I\r\nlaughed\u2014the dwarf\u2019s yell burst from my lips\u2014_I_ banished! Oh no! they\r\nhad not exiled the foul limbs I wore; I might with these enter, without\r\nfear of incurring the threatened penalty of death, my own, my native\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nI began to walk towards Genoa. I was somewhat accustomed to my distorted\r\nlimbs; none were ever so ill-adapted for a straightforward movement; it\r\nwas with infinite difficulty that I proceeded. Then, too, I desired to\r\navoid all the hamlets strewed here and there on the sea-beach, for I was\r\nunwilling to make a display of my hideousness. I was not quite sure\r\nthat, if seen, the mere boys would not stone me to death as I passed,\r\nfor a monster; some ungentle salutations I did receive from the few\r\npeasants or fishermen I chanced to meet. But it was dark night before I\r\napproached Genoa. The weather was so balmy and sweet that it struck me\r\nthat the Marchese and his daughter would very probably have quitted the\r\ncity for their country retreat. It was from Villa Torella that I had\r\nattempted to carry off Juliet; I had spent many an hour reconnoitring\r\nthe spot, and knew each inch of ground in its vicinity. It was\r\nbeautifully situated, embosomed in trees, on the margin of a stream. As\r\nI drew near, it became evident that my conjecture was right; nay,\r\nmoreover, that the hours were being then devoted to feasting and\r\nmerriment. For the house was lighted up; strains of soft and gay music\r\nwere wafted towards me by the breeze. My heart sank within me. Such was\r\nthe generous kindness of Torella\u2019s heart that I felt sure that he would\r\nnot have indulged in public manifestations of rejoicing just after my\r\nunfortunate banishment, but for a cause I dared not dwell upon.\r\n\r\nThe country people were all alive and flocking about; it became\r\nnecessary that I should conceal myself; and yet I longed to address some\r\none, or to hear others discourse, or in any way to gain intelligence of\r\nwhat was really going on. At length, entering the walks that were in\r\nimmediate vicinity to the mansion, I found one dark enough to veil my\r\nexcessive frightfulness; and yet others as well as I were loitering in\r\nits shade. I soon gathered all I wanted to know\u2014all that first made my\r\nvery heart die with horror, and then boil with indignation. To-morrow\r\nJuliet was to be given to the penitent, reformed, beloved\r\nGuido\u2014to-morrow my bride was to pledge her vows to a fiend from hell!\r\nAnd I did this!\u2014my accursed pride\u2014my demoniac violence and wicked\r\nself-idolatry had caused this act. For if I had acted as the wretch who\r\nhad stolen my form had acted\u2014if, with a mien at once yielding and\r\ndignified, I had presented myself to Torella, saying, I have done wrong,\r\nforgive me; I am unworthy of your angel-child, but permit me to claim\r\nher hereafter, when my altered conduct shall manifest that I abjure my\r\nvices, and endeavour to become in some sort worthy of her. I go to serve\r\nagainst the infidels; and when my zeal for religion and my true\r\npenitence for the past shall appear to you to cancel my crimes, permit\r\nme again to call myself your son. Thus had he spoken; and the penitent\r\nwas welcomed even as the prodigal son of Scripture: the fatted calf was\r\nkilled for him; and he, still pursuing the same path, displayed such\r\nopen-hearted regret for his follies, so humble a concession of all his\r\nrights, and so ardent a resolve to reacquire them by a life of\r\ncontrition and virtue, that he quickly conquered the kind old man; and\r\nfull pardon, and the gift of his lovely child, followed in swift\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nOh, had an angel from Paradise whispered to me to act thus! But now,\r\nwhat would be the innocent Juliet\u2019s fate? Would God permit the foul\r\nunion\u2014or, some prodigy destroying it, link the dishonoured name of\r\nCarega with the worst of crimes? To-morrow at dawn they were to be\r\nmarried: there was but one way to prevent this\u2014to meet mine enemy, and\r\nto enforce the ratification of our agreement. I felt that this could\r\nonly be done by a mortal struggle. I had no sword\u2014if indeed my distorted\r\narms could wield a soldier\u2019s weapon\u2014but I had a dagger, and in that lay\r\nmy hope. There was no time for pondering or balancing nicely the\r\nquestion: I might die in the attempt; but besides the burning jealousy\r\nand despair of my own heart, honour, mere humanity, demanded that I\r\nshould fall rather than not destroy the machinations of the fiend.\r\n\r\nThe guests departed\u2014the lights began to disappear; it was evident that\r\nthe inhabitants of the villa were seeking repose. I hid myself among the\r\ntrees\u2014the garden grew desert\u2014the gates were closed\u2014I wandered round and\r\ncame under a window\u2014ah! well did I know the same!\u2014a soft twilight\r\nglimmered in the room\u2014the curtains were half withdrawn. It was the\r\ntemple of innocence and beauty. Its magnificence was tempered, as it\r\nwere, by the slight disarrangements occasioned by its being dwelt in,\r\nand all the objects scattered around displayed the taste of her who\r\nhallowed it by her presence. I saw her enter with a quick light step\u2014I\r\nsaw her approach the window\u2014she drew back the curtain yet further, and\r\nlooked out into the night. Its breezy freshness played among her\r\nringlets, and wafted them from the transparent marble of her brow. She\r\nclasped her hands, she raised her eyes to heaven. I heard her voice.\r\nGuido! she softly murmured\u2014mine own Guido! and then, as if overcome by\r\nthe fulness of her own heart, she sank on her knees;\u2014her upraised\r\neyes\u2014her graceful attitude\u2014the beaming thankfulness that lighted up her\r\nface\u2014oh, these are tame words! Heart of mine, thou imagest ever, though\r\nthou canst not portray, the celestial beauty of that child of light and\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nI heard a step\u2014a quick firm step along the shady avenue. Soon I saw a\r\ncavalier, richly dressed, young and, methought, graceful to look on,\r\nadvance. I hid myself yet closer. The youth approached; he paused\r\nbeneath the window. She arose, and again looking out she saw him, and\r\nsaid\u2014I cannot, no, at this distant time I cannot record her terms of\r\nsoft silver tenderness; to me they were spoken, but they were replied to\r\nby him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will not go,\u201d he cried: \u201chere where you have been, where your memory\r\nglides like some heaven-visiting ghost, I will pass the long hours till\r\nwe meet, never, my Juliet, again, day or night, to part. But do thou, my\r\nlove, retire; the cold morn and fitful breeze will make thy cheek pale,\r\nand fill with languor thy love-lighted eyes. Ah, sweetest! could I press\r\none kiss upon them, I could, methinks, repose.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd then he approached still nearer, and methought he was about to\r\nclamber into her chamber. I had hesitated, not to terrify her; now I was\r\nno longer master of myself. I rushed forward\u2014I threw myself on him\u2014I\r\ntore him away\u2014I cried, \u201cO loathsome and foul-shaped wretch!\u201d\r\n\r\nI need not repeat epithets, all tending, as it appeared, to rail at a\r\nperson I at present feel some partiality for. A shriek rose from\r\nJuliet\u2019s lips. I neither heard nor saw\u2014I _felt_ only mine enemy, whose\r\nthroat I grasped, and my dagger\u2019s hilt; he struggled, but could not\r\nescape. At length hoarsely he breathed these words: \u201cDo!\u2014strike home!\r\ndestroy this body\u2014you will still live: may your life be long and merry!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe descending dagger was arrested at the word, and he, feeling my hold\r\nrelax, extricated himself and drew his sword, while the uproar in the\r\nhouse, and flying of torches from one room to the other, showed that\r\nsoon we should be separated. In the midst of my frenzy there was much\r\ncalculation:\u2014fall I might, and so that he did not survive, I cared not\r\nfor the death-blow I might deal against myself. While still, therefore,\r\nhe thought I paused, and while I saw the villanous resolve to take\r\nadvantage of my hesitation, in the sudden thrust he made at me, I threw\r\nmyself on his sword, and at the same moment plunged my dagger, with a\r\ntrue, desperate aim, in his side. We fell together, rolling over each\r\nother, and the tide of blood that flowed from the gaping wound of each\r\nmingled on the grass. More I know not\u2014I fainted.\r\n\r\nAgain I return to life: weak almost to death, I found myself stretched\r\nupon a bed\u2014Juliet was kneeling beside it. Strange! my first broken\r\nrequest was for a mirror. I was so wan and ghastly, that my poor girl\r\nhesitated, as she told me afterwards; but, by the mass! I thought myself\r\na right proper youth when I saw the dear reflection of my own well-known\r\nfeatures. I confess it is a weakness, but I avow it, I do entertain a\r\nconsiderable affection for the countenance and limbs I behold, whenever\r\nI look at a glass; and have more mirrors in my house, and consult them\r\noftener, than any beauty in Genoa. Before you too much condemn me,\r\npermit me to say that no one better knows than I the value of his own\r\nbody; no one, probably, except myself, ever having had it stolen from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIncoherently I at first talked of the dwarf and his crimes, and\r\nreproached Juliet for her too easy admission of his love. She thought me\r\nraving, as well she might; and yet it was some time before I could\r\nprevail on myself to admit that the Guido whose penitence had won her\r\nback for me was myself; and while I cursed bitterly the monstrous dwarf,\r\nand blest the well-directed blow that had deprived him of life, I\r\nsuddenly checked myself when I heard her say, Amen! knowing that him\r\nwhom she reviled was my very self. A little reflection taught me\r\nsilence\u2014a little practice enabled me to speak of that frightful night\r\nwithout any very excessive blunder. The wound I had given myself was no\r\nmockery of one\u2014it was long before I recovered\u2014and as the benevolent and\r\ngenerous Torella sat beside me, talking such wisdom as might win friends\r\nto repentance, and mine own dear Juliet hovered near me, administering\r\nto my wants, and cheering me by her smiles, the work of my bodily cure\r\nand mental reform went on together. I have never, indeed, wholly\r\nrecovered my strength\u2014my cheek is paler since\u2014my person a little bent.\r\nJuliet sometimes ventures to allude bitterly to the malice that caused\r\nthis change, but I kiss her on the moment, and tell her all is for the\r\nbest. I am a fonder and more faithful husband, and true is this\u2014but for\r\nthat wound, never had I called her mine.\r\n\r\nI did not revisit the sea-shore, nor seek for the fiend\u2019s treasure; yet,\r\nwhile I ponder on the past, I often think, and my confessor was not\r\nbackward in favouring the idea, that it might be a good rather than an\r\nevil spirit, sent by my guardian angel, to show me the folly and misery\r\nof pride. So well at least did I learn this lesson, roughly taught as I\r\nwas, that I am known now by all my friends and fellow-citizens by the\r\nname of Guido il Cortese.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   X.\r\n\r\n                          _THE SWISS PEASANT._\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY is the mind of man so apt to be swayed by contraries? why does the\r\nimagination for ever paint the impossible in glittering tints, and the\r\nhearts of wayward mortals cling, with the greatest tenacity, to what,\r\neel-like, is bent on escaping from their grasp? Why\u2014to bring the matter\r\nhome\u2014is solitude abhorrent to me, now that I enjoy it in perfection? I\r\nhave apostrophized the coy nymph in ball-rooms, when the bright lamps of\r\nheaven were shamed by brighter earth-stars, and lamented her absence at\r\na picnic party, where the nightingale was silenced by the fiddle.\r\n\r\nAnd now, O solitude! I abjure thee, in thy fitting temple\u2014in\r\nSwitzerland\u2014among cloud-piercing mountains, by the resounding waves of\r\nthe isle-surrounding lake. I am beside the waters of Uri\u2014where Tell\r\nlived\u2014in Brunen, where the Swiss patriots swore to die for freedom. It\r\nrains\u2014magic word to destroy the spell to which these words give rise\u2014the\r\nclouds envelop the hills\u2014the white mists veil the ravines\u2014there is a\r\nroar and a splash in my ears\u2014and now and then the vapours break and\r\nscatter themselves, and I see something dark between, which is the hoar\r\nside of a dark precipice, but which might as well be the turf stack or\r\nold wall that bounded Cumberland\u2019s view as he wrote the _Wheel of\r\nFortune_.\r\n\r\nThe sole book that I possess is the _Prisoner of Chillon_. I have read\r\nit through three times within an hour. Its noble author composed it to\r\nbeguile weary hours like these when he remained rain-bound for three\r\ndays in a little inn on the shores of the Lake of Geneva; and cannot I,\r\nfollowing with unequal steps, so cheat the minutes in this dim spot? I\r\nnever, by the by, could invent the commonest incident. As a man of\r\nhonour, of course I never lie; but, as a nursery child and schoolboy, I\r\nnever did; simply, as I remember, because I never could concoct one;\u2014but\r\na true tale was lately narrated to me by its very heroine, the incidents\r\nof which haunt my memory, adorned as they were by her animated looks and\r\nsoft silvery accent. Let me try to record them, stripped though they\r\nmust be of their greatest charm.\r\n\r\nI was, but a week ago, travelling with my friend Ashburn in a coup\u00e9e, in\r\nthe district of Subiaco, in the ecclesiastical territory. We were jolted\r\nalong a rough ravine, through which the river Anio sped, and beetling\r\nmountains and shady trees, a distant convent and a picturesque cell on a\r\nhill, formed a view which so awoke the pictorial propensities of my\r\nfriend, that he stopped the coup\u00e9e (though we were assured that we\r\nshould never reach our inn by nightfall, and that the road was dangerous\r\nin the dark), took out his portfolio, and began to sketch. As he drew, I\r\ncontinued to speak in support of an argument we had entered upon before.\r\nI had been complaining of the commonplace and ennui of life. Ashburn\r\ninsisted that our existence was only too full of variety and\r\nchange\u2014tragic variety and wondrous incredible change. \u201cEven,\u201d said the\r\npainter, \u201cas sky, and earth, and water seem for ever the same to the\r\nvulgar eye, and yet to the gifted one assume a thousand various guises\r\nand hues\u2014now robed in purple\u2014now shrouded in black\u2014now resplendent with\r\nliving gold\u2014and anon sinking into sober and unobtrusive grey, so do our\r\nmortal lives change and vary. No living being among us but could tell a\r\ntale of soul-subduing joys and heart-consuming woes, worthy, had they\r\ntheir poet, of the imagination of Shakespeare or Goethe. The veriest\r\nweather-worn cabin is a study for colouring, and the meanest peasant\r\nwill offer all the acts of a drama in the apparently dull routine of his\r\nhumble life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is pure romance,\u201d I replied; \u201cput it to the test. Let us take, for\r\nexample, yonder woman descending the mountain-path.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a figure!\u201d cried Ashburn; \u201coh that she would stay thus but one\r\nquarter of an hour!\u2014she has come down to bathe her child\u2014her upturned\r\nface\u2014her dark hair\u2014her picturesque costume\u2014the little plump fellow\r\nbestriding her\u2014the rude scenery around\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the romantic tale she has to tell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would wager a louis that hers has been no common fate. She steps a\r\ngoddess\u2014her attitude, her looks, are all filled with majesty.\u201d\r\n\r\nI laughed at his enthusiasm, and accepted his bet. We hurried to join\r\nour fair peasantess, and thus formed acquaintance with Fanny Chaumont. A\r\nsudden storm, as we were engaged conversing with her, came, driven down\r\nfrom the tempest-bearing hills, and she gave us a cordial invitation to\r\nher cottage.\r\n\r\nIt was situated on a sunny, yet sheltered slope. There was a look of\r\ncheerfulness and _aisance_ about it, beyond what is usually met in that\r\npart of Switzerland, reminding me of the cottages of the inhabitants of\r\nthe free States. There, also, we found her husband. I always feel\r\ncurious to know on whom a woman, who bears the stamp of superior\r\nintellect, who is beautiful and refined\u2014for peasant as she was, Fanny\r\nwas both\u2014has been induced to bestow herself.\r\n\r\nLouis Chaumont was considerably older than his wife; he was handsome,\r\nwith brown lively eyes, curly chestnut hair, a visage embrowned by the\r\nsun, bearing every mark of having led an active, even an adventurous\r\nlife; there was, besides, an expression which, if it were not ferocity,\r\nresembled it, in his vivacious glances, and in the sternness of his\r\ndeeply-lined forehead; while she, in spite of her finely-formed brow,\r\nher majestic person, and her large expressive eyes, looked softness and\r\npatience itself. There was something incongruous in the pair, and more\r\nstrangely matched they seemed when we heard their story. It lost me my\r\nlouis, but proved Fanny at once to be a fitting heroine for romance, and\r\nwas a lesson, moreover, to teach the strange pranks love can play with\r\nus, mingling fire and water, blending in one harmonious concord the\r\nharsh base and melodious tenor of two differently stringed instruments.\r\nThough their child was five years old, Fanny and her husband were\r\nattached to each other with the tenderness and passion of early love;\r\nthey were happy\u2014his faults were tempered by her angel disposition, and\r\nher too melancholy and feeling-fraught spirit was enlivened and made\r\nplastic to the purposes of this world by his energy and activity.\r\n\r\nFanny was a Bernese by birth: she was the child of humble cottagers, one\r\namong a large family. They lived on the brow of one summit and at the\r\nfoot of another. The snowy mountains were piled about them; thaw-fed\r\ntorrents brawled around; during the night a sound like thunder, a crash\r\namong the tempest-beaten pines would tell of an avalanche; or the\r\nsnowdrift, whirring past the lattice, threatened to bury the little\r\nfabric. Winter was the season of peace in the deep vales, not so in the\r\nhigher district. The peasant was often kept waking by the soft-falling\r\nsnow which threatened insidiously to encroach on, and to overwhelm his\r\nhabitation; or a straying cow would lead him far into the depths of the\r\nstormy hills, and his fearful family would count in agony the hours of\r\nhis absence. Perpetual hardship and danger, however, rather brutify than\r\nexalt the soul of man; and those of the Swiss who are most deeply\r\nplanted among the rocky wilds are often stultified and sullen.\r\n\r\nFanny opened her youthful eyes and observation on this scene. She was\r\none of those lovely children whose beauty is heartfelt but\r\nindescribable: hers was the smooth candid brow, the large hazel eyes,\r\nhalf soft, half wild; the round dimpled cheek, the full sensitive mouth,\r\nthe pointed chin, and (as framework to the picture) the luxuriant curly\r\nchestnut hair, and voice which is sweetest music. The exceeding beauty\r\nof little Fanny gained her the observation of the wife of the owner of\r\nthe chateau which overlooked and commanded the district, and at ten\r\nyears of age she became a frequent visitor there. Fanny\u2019s little soul\r\nwas love, so she soon twined herself round the kind lady\u2019s heart, became\r\na pet with her husband, and the favourite playmate of their only son.\r\n\r\nOne f\u00eate day Fanny had dined at the chateau. It had been fine warm\r\nspring weather, but wind and storm came on with the setting sun; the\r\nsnow began to fall thickly, and it was decided that Fanny must pass the\r\nnight in the chateau. She had been unusually eager to return home; and\r\nwhen the tempest came on, she crept near her protectress, and begged to\r\nbe sent to her mother. _C\u2019est impossible_\u2014Fanny pressed no further, but\r\nshe clambered to a window, and looked out wistfully to where, hidden by\r\nthe hills, her parents\u2019 cottage stood. It was a fatal night for her: the\r\nthunders of frequent avalanches, the roaring of torrents, the crash of\r\ntrees, spoke of devastation, and her home was its chief prey. Father,\r\nmother, brothers, and sisters, not one survived. Where, the day before,\r\ncottage and outhouse and flower garden had stood, the little lawn where\r\nshe played, and the grove that sheltered her, there was now a monumental\r\npile of snow, and the rocky path of a torrent; no trace remained, not\r\none survivor to tell the tale. From that night Fanny became a constant\r\ninmate of the chateau.\r\n\r\nIt was Madame de Marville\u2019s project to give her a bourgeois education,\r\nwhich would raise her from the hardships of a peasant\u2019s life, and yet\r\nnot elevate her above her natural position in society. She was brought\r\nup kindly, but humbly; it was the virtues of her disposition which\r\nraised her in the eyes of all around her\u2014not any ill-judged favour of\r\nher benefactress. The night of the destruction of her family never\r\npassed away from her memory; it set a seal of untimely seriousness on\r\nher childish brow, awoke deep thoughts in her infant heart, and a strong\r\nresolve that while she lived, her beloved friends should find her, as\r\nfar as her humble powers admitted, a source of good alone\u2014a reason to\r\nrejoice that they had saved her from the destruction that had\r\noverwhelmed her family.\r\n\r\nThus Fanny grew up in beauty and in virtue. Her smiles were as the\r\nrainbows of her native torrents: her voice, her caresses, her light\r\nstep, her unalterable sweetness and ceaseless devotion to the wishes of\r\nothers, made her the idol of the family. Henry, the only child of her\r\nprotectors, was of her own age, or but a few months her senior. Every\r\ntime Henry returned from school to visit his parents, he found Fanny\r\nmore beautiful, more kind, more attractive than before; and the first\r\npassion his youthful heart knew was for the lovely peasant girl, whose\r\nvirtues sanctified his home. A look, a gesture betrayed his secret to\r\nhis mother; she turned a hasty glance on Fanny, and saw on her\r\ncountenance innocence and confidence alone. Half reassured, yet still\r\nfearful, Madame de Marville began to reflect on some cure for the\r\nthreatened evil. She could not bear to send away Fanny; she was\r\nsolicitous that her son should for the present reside in his home. The\r\nlovely girl was perfectly unconscious of the sentiments of the young\r\nseigneur; but would she always continue so? and was the burning heart\r\nthat warmed her gentle bosom to be for ever insensible to the despotic\r\nand absorbing emotions of love?\r\n\r\nIt was with wonder, and a curious mixture of disappointed maternal pride\r\nand real gladness, that the lady at length discovered a passion dawning\r\nin fair Fanny\u2019s heart for Louis Chaumont, a peasant some ten years older\r\nthan herself. It was natural that one with such high-wrought feelings as\r\nour heroine should love one to whom she could look up, and on whom to\r\ndepend, rather than her childhood\u2019s playmate\u2014the gay, thoughtless Henry.\r\nLouis\u2019s family had been the victim of a moral ruin, as hers of a\r\nphysical one. They had been oppressed, reduced to poverty, driven from\r\ntheir homes by a feudal tyrant, and had come poor and forlorn from a\r\ndistant district. His mother, accustomed to a bourgeois\u2019 life, died\r\nbroken-hearted: his father, a man of violent passions, nourished in his\r\nown and in his son\u2019s heart, sentiments of hatred and revenge against the\r\n\u201cproud oppressors of the land.\u201d They were obliged to labour hard, yet in\r\nthe intervals of work, father and son would read or discourse concerning\r\nthe ills attendant on humanity, and they traced all to the social\r\nsystem, which made the few the tyrants of the many.\r\n\r\nLouis was handsome, bold, and active; he excelled his compeers in every\r\nhardy exercise; his resolution, his daring, made him, in spite of his\r\npoverty, a kind of leader among them. He had many faults; he was too\r\nfull of passion, of the spirit of resistance and revenge; but his heart\r\nwas kind; his understanding, when not thwarted, strong; and the very\r\ndepth of his feelings made him keenly susceptible to love. Fanny, in her\r\nsimple but majestic beauty, in her soft kindness of manner, mingled with\r\nthe profoundest sensibility, made a deep impression on the young man\u2019s\r\nheart. His converse, so different and so superior to those of his\r\nfellows, won her attention.\r\n\r\nHitherto Fanny had never given utterance to the secrets of her soul.\r\nHabitual respect held her silent with Madame, and Henry, as spirited and\r\nas heedless as a chamois, could ill understand her; but Louis became the\r\ndepository of the many feelings which, piled up in secrecy and silence,\r\nwere half awful to herself; he brought reason, or what he deemed such,\r\nto direct her heart-born conclusions. To have heard them talk of life\r\nand death, and all its shows, you would have wondered by what freak\r\nphilosophy had dressed herself in youth and a peasant\u2019s garb, and\r\nwandered from the schools to these untaught wilds.\r\n\r\nMadame de Marville saw and encouraged this attachment. Louis was not\r\nexactly the person she would have selected for Fanny; but he was the\r\nonly being for whom she had ever evinced a predilection; and, besides,\r\nthe danger of a misalliance which threatened her own son, rendered her\r\neager to build an insurmountable wall between him and the object of his\r\naffections. Thus Fanny enjoyed the heart-gladdening pride of hearing her\r\nchoice applauded and praised by the person she most respected and loved\r\nin the world. As yet, however, love had been covert; the soul but not\r\nthe apparent body of their intercourse. Louis was kept in awe by this\r\nhigh-minded girl, and Fanny had not yet learned her own secret. It was\r\nHenry who made the discovery for them;\u2014Henry, who, with all the\r\nimpetuosity of his vivacious character, contrived a thousand ways to\r\ncome between them, who, stung by jealousy to injustice, reviled Louis\r\nfor his ruin, his poverty, his opinions, and brought the spirit of\r\ndissension to disquiet a mind entirely bent, as she imagined, on holy\r\nand pure thoughts.\r\n\r\nUnder this clash of passion, the action of the drama rapidly developed\r\nitself, and, for nearly a year, a variety of scenes were acted among\r\nthese secluded mountains of no interest save to the parties themselves,\r\nbut to them fateful and engrossing. Louis and Fanny exchanged vows; but\r\nthat sufficed not. Fanny insisted on the right of treating with uniform\r\nkindness the son of her best friend, in spite of his injustice and\r\ninsolence. The young men were often, during the rural festivals, brought\r\ninto angry collision. Fanny was the peacemaker: but a woman is the worst\r\npossible mediator between her rival lovers. Henry was sometimes\r\nirritated to complain to his father of Louis\u2019 presumption. The spirit of\r\nthe French Revolution then awakening, rendered a peasant\u2019s assumptions\r\npeculiarly grating; and it required Madame de Marville\u2019s impartial\r\ngentleness to prevent Fanny\u2019s betrothed, as now he was almost\r\nconsidered, from being further oppressed.\r\n\r\nAt length it was decided that Henry should absent himself for a time,\r\nand visit Paris. He was enraged in the extreme by what he called his\r\nbanishment. Noble and generous as he naturally was, love was the tyrant\r\nof his soul, and drove him almost to crime. He entered into a fierce\r\nquarrel with his rival on the very eve of his departure: it ended in a\r\nscene of violence and bloodshed. No great real harm was done; but\r\nMonsieur de Marville, hitherto scarcely kept back from such a measure by\r\nhis wife, suddenly obtained an order for Louis (his father had died a\r\nyear before) to quit the territory within twelve hours. Fanny was\r\ncommanded, as she valued the favour of her friends, to give him up. The\r\nyoung men were both gone before any intercession could avail; and that\r\nkind of peace which resembles desolation took possession of the chateau.\r\n\r\nAware of the part she had taken in encouraging Fanny\u2019s attachment to her\r\npeasant-lover, Madame de Marville did not make herself a party to the\r\ntyranny of her husband; she requested only of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e to defer any\r\ndecisive step, and not to quit her guardianship until the return of her\r\nson, which was to take place the following year. Fanny consented to such\r\na delay, although in doing so she had to resist the angry\r\nrepresentations of her lover, who exacted that she should quit the roof\r\nof his oppressors. It was galling to his proud spirit that she should\r\ncontinue to receive benefits from them, and injurious to his love that\r\nshe should remain where his rival\u2019s name was the constant theme of\r\ndiscourse and the object of interest. Fanny in vain represented her debt\r\nof gratitude, the absence of Henry, the impossibility that she could\r\nfeel any undue sentiment towards the young seigneur; not to hate him was\r\na crime in Louis\u2019 eyes; yet how, in spite of his ill-conduct, could\r\nFanny hate her childhood\u2019s playmate\u2014her brother? His violent passions\r\nexcited to their utmost height\u2014jealousy and the sense of impotent\r\nindignation raging in his heart\u2014Louis swore to revenge himself on the\r\nMarvilles\u2014to forget and to abhor his mistress!\u2014his last words were a\r\nmalediction on them, and a violent denunciation of scorn upon her.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will all be well yet,\u201d thought Fanny, as she strove to calm the\r\ntumultuous and painful emotions to which his intemperate passion gave\r\nrise. \u201cNot only are storms the birth of the wild elements, but of the\r\nheart of man, and we can oppose patience and fortitude alone to their\r\ndestructive violence. A year will pass\u2014I shall quit the chateau; Louis\r\nwill acknowledge my truth, and retract his frightful words.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe continued, therefore, to fulfil her duties cheerfully, not\r\npermitting her thoughts to dwell on the idea, that, in spite of her\r\nstruggles, too painfully occupied her\u2014the probability that Louis would\r\nin the end renounce or forget her; but committing her cause to the\r\nspirit of good, she trusted that its influence would in the end prevail.\r\n\r\nShe had, however, much to endure; for months passed, and no tidings\r\nreached her of Louis. Often she felt sick at heart; often she became the\r\nprey of the darkest despair; above all, her tender heart missed the fond\r\nattentions of love, the bliss of knowing that she bestowed happiness,\r\nand the unrestrained intercourse to which mutual affection had given\r\nrise. She cherished hope as a duty, and faith in love, rather than in\r\nher unjust and cruelly neglectful lover. It was a hard task, for she had\r\nnowhere to turn for consolation or encouragement. Madame de Marville\r\nmarked with gladness the total separation between them. Now that the\r\ndanger that threatened her son was averted, she relented having been\r\ninfluential in producing an attachment between Fanny and one whom she\r\ndeemed unworthy of her. She redoubled her kindness, and, in the true\r\nContinental fashion, tried to get up a match between her and some one\r\namong her many and more prosperous admirers. She failed, but did not\r\ndespair, till she saw the poor girl\u2019s cheek grow pale and her vivacity\r\ndesert her, as month after month passed away, and the very name of Louis\r\nappeared to be forgotten by all except herself.\r\n\r\nThe stirring and terrible events that took place at this time in France\r\nadded to Fanny\u2019s distress of mind. She had been familiarized to the\r\ndiscussion of the theories, now attempted to be put in practice, by the\r\nconversations of Chaumont. As each fresh account brought information of\r\nthe guilty and sanguinary acts of men whose opinions were the same as\r\nthose of her lover, her fears on his account increased. In a few words I\r\nshall hurry over this part of her story. Switzerland became agitated by\r\nthe same commotions as tore the near kingdom. The peasantry rose in\r\ntumult; acts of violence and blood were committed; at first at a\r\ndistance from her retired valley, but gradually approaching its\r\nprecincts, until at last the tree of liberty was set up in the\r\nneighbouring village. Monsieur de Marville was an aristocrat of the most\r\nbigoted species. In vain was the danger represented to him, and the\r\nunwarlike state of his retinue. He armed them\u2014he hurried down\u2014he came\r\nunawares on the crowd who were proclaiming the triumph of liberty,\r\nrather by feasting than force. On the first attack, they were dispersed,\r\nand one or two among them were wounded; the pole they had gathered round\r\nwas uprooted, the emblematic cap trampled to the earth. The governor\r\nreturned victorious to his chateau.\r\n\r\nThis act of violence on his part seemed the match to fire a train of\r\norganized resistance to his authority, of which none had dreamt before.\r\nStrangers from other cantons thronged into the valley; rustic labours\r\nwere cast aside; popular assemblies were held, and the peasants\r\nexercised in the use of arms. One was coming to place himself at their\r\nhead, it was said, who had been a party in the tumults at Geneva. Louis\r\nChaumont was coming\u2014the champion of liberty, the sworn enemy of M. de\r\nMarville. The influence of his presence soon became manifest. The\r\ninhabitants of the chateau were besieged. If one ventured beyond a\r\ncertain limit he was assailed. It was the resolve of Louis that all\r\nwithin its walls should surrender themselves to his mercy. What that\r\nmight be, the proud curl of his lip and the fire that glanced from his\r\ndark eyes rendered scarcely problematic. Fanny would not believe the\r\nworst of her lover, but Monsieur and Madame de Marville, no longer\r\nrestrained by any delicacy, spoke of the leveller in unmeasured terms of\r\nabhorrence, comparing him to the monsters who then reigned in France,\r\nwhile the danger they incurred through him added a bitter sting to their\r\nwords. The peril grew each day; famine began to make its appearance in\r\nthe chateau; while the intelligence which some of the more friendly\r\npeasants brought was indicative of preparations for a regular attack of\r\nthe most formidable nature. A summons at last came from the insurgents.\r\nThey were resolved to destroy the emblem of their slavery\u2014the feudal\r\nhalls of their tyrants. They declared their intention of firing the\r\nchateau the next day, and called on all within to deliver themselves up,\r\nif they would not be buried in its ruins. They offered their lives and\r\nfree leave to depart to all, save the governor himself, who must place\r\nhimself unconditionally at the mercy of their leader. \u201cThe wretch,\u201d\r\nexclaimed his lady, \u201cwho thirsts for your blood! Fly! if there is yet\r\ntime for flight; we, you see, are safe. Fly! nor suffer these cruel\r\ndastards to boast of having murdered you.\u201d\r\n\r\nM. de Marville yielded to these entreaties and representations. He had\r\nsent for a military force to aid him\u2014it had been denied. He saw that he\r\nhimself, as the detested person, was the cause of danger to his family.\r\nIt was therefore agreed that he should seek a ch\u00e2let situated on a\r\nmountain ten leagues distant, where he might lie concealed till his\r\nfamily joined him. Accordingly, in a base disguise, he quitted at\r\nmidnight the walls he was unable to defend; a miserable night for the\r\nunfortunate beings left behind. The coming day was to witness the\r\ndestruction of their home; and they, beggars in the world, were to\r\nwander through the inhospitable mountains, till, with caution and\r\nterror, they could unobserved reach the remote and miserable ch\u00e2let, and\r\nlearn the fate of the unhappy fugitive. It was a sleepless night for\r\nall. To add to Madame\u2019s agony, she knew that her son\u2019s life was in\r\ndanger in Paris\u2014that he had been denounced\u2014and, though yet untaken, his\r\nescape was still uncertain. From the turret of the castle that, situated\r\nhigh on a rock, commanded the valley below, she sat the livelong night\r\nwatching for every sound\u2014fearful of some shout, some report of firearms,\r\nwhich would announce the capture of her husband. It was September; the\r\nnights were chill; pale and trembling, she saw day break over the hills.\r\nFanny had busied herself during these anxious hours by preparing for\r\ntheir departure; the terrified domestics had already fled; she, the\r\nlady, and the old lame gardener were all that remained. At dawn she\r\nbrought forth the mule, and harnessed him to the rude vehicle which was\r\nto convey them to their place of refuge. Whatever was most valuable in\r\nthe chateau had already been sent away long before, or was secreted; a\r\nfew necessaries alone she provided. And now she ascended the turret\r\nstairs, and stood before her protectress, announcing that all was ready,\r\nand that they must depart. At this last moment, Madame de Marville\r\nappeared deprived of strength; she strove to rise\u2014she sank to the ground\r\nin a fit. Forgetful of her deserted state, Fanny called aloud for help,\r\nand then her heart beat wildly as a quick, youthful step was heard on\r\nthe stairs. Who could he be? would _he_ come to insult their\r\nwretchedness\u2014he, the author of their woe? The first glance changed the\r\nobject of her terror. Henry flew to his mother\u2019s side, and, with broken\r\nexclamations and agitated questions, demanded an explanation of what he\r\nsaw. He had fled for safety to the habitation of his parents\u2014he found it\r\ndeserted; the first voice he heard was that of Fanny crying for help\u2014the\r\nfirst sight that presented itself was his mother, to all appearance\r\ndead, lying on the floor of the turret. Her recovery was followed by\r\nbrief explanations, and a consultation of how his safety was to be\r\nprovided for. The name of Chaumont excited his bitterest execrations.\r\nWith a soldier\u2019s haughty resolve, he was darting from the castle to meet\r\nand to wreak vengeance on his rival. His mother threw herself at his\r\nfeet, clasping his knees, calling wildly on him not to desert her.\r\nFanny\u2019s gentle, sweet voice was of more avail to calm his passion.\r\n\u201cChevalier,\u201d she said, \u201cit is not thus that you must display your\r\ncourage or protect the helpless. To encounter yonder infuriated mob\r\nwould be to run on certain death; you must preserve yourself for your\r\nfamily\u2014you must have pity on your mother, who cannot survive you. Be\r\nguided by me, I beseech you.\u201d\r\n\r\nHenry yielded to her voice, and a more reasonable arrangement took\r\nplace. The departure of Madame de Marville and Fanny was expected at the\r\nvillage, and a pledge had been given that they should proceed\r\nunmolested. But deeply had the insurgents sworn that if the governor or\r\nhis son (whose arrival in the chateau had been suspected) attempted to\r\nescape with them, they should be immediately sacrificed to _justice_. No\r\ndisguise would suffice\u2014the active observation of their enemies was\r\nknown. Every inhabitant of the castle had been numbered\u2014the fate of each\r\nascertained, save that of the two most detested\u2014the governor, whose\r\nflight had not been discovered, and his son, whose arrival was so\r\nunexpected and ill-timed. As still they consulted, a beat to arms was\r\nheard in the valley below: it was the signal that the attack on the\r\nempty castle walls would soon begin. There was no time for delay or\r\nhesitation. Henry placed himself at the bottom of the charrette; straw\r\nand a variety of articles were heaped upon him; the two women ascended\r\nin trepidation; and the old gardener sat in front and held the reins.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the disturbed state of the districts through which\r\nthey were to pass,\u2014where the appearance of one of the upper classes\r\nexcited the fiercest enmity, and frightful insult, if not death, was\r\ntheir sure welcome,\u2014Madame and her friend assumed a peasant\u2019s garb. And\r\nthus they wound their way down the steep; the unhappy lady weeping\r\nbitterly; Fanny, with tearless eyes, but with pale cheek and compressed\r\nlips, gazing for the last time on the abode which had been her refuge\r\nwhen, in helpless infancy, she was left an orphan\u2014where kindness and\r\nbenevolence had waited on her, and where her days had passed in\r\ninnocence and peace. \u201cAnd he drives us away!\u2014him, whom I loved\u2014whom I\r\nlove!\u2014O misery!\u201d\r\n\r\nThey reached the foot of the eminence on which the chateau was placed,\r\nand proceeded along the road which led directly through the village.\r\nWith the approach of danger, vain regrets were exchanged for a lively\r\nsense of fear in the bosom of the hapless mother, and for the exertion\r\nof her courage and forethought in Fanny\u2019s more energetic mind. They\r\npassed a peasant or two, who uttered a malediction or imprecation on\r\nthem as they went; then groups of two or three, who were even more\r\nviolent in gesture and menace; when suddenly the sound of many steps\r\ncame on their ears, and at a turn of the road they met Chaumont with a\r\nband of about twenty disciplined men.\r\n\r\n\u201cFear not,\u201d he said to Madame de Marville; \u201cI will protect you from\r\ndanger till you are beyond the village.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a shriek, the lady, in answer, threw herself in Fanny\u2019s arms.\r\n\r\n\u201cFear not, Madame\u2014he dares not injure you. Begone, Louis! insult us not\r\nby your presence. Begone! I say.\u201d\r\n\r\nFanny spoke angrily. She had not adopted this tone, but that the lady\u2019s\r\nterror, and the knowledge that even then the young soldier crouched at\r\ntheir feet, burnt to spring up and confront his enemy, made her use an\r\nauthority which a woman always imagines that a lover dare not resist.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not insult you,\u201d repeated Chaumont\u2014\u201cI save you. I have no quarrel\r\nwith the lady; tyrants alone need fear me. You are not safe without my\r\nescort. Do not you, false girl, irritate me. I have ensured her escape;\r\nbut yours\u2014you are in my power.\u201d\r\n\r\nA violent movement at the bottom of the charrette called forth all\r\nFanny\u2019s terrors.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake me!\u201d she cried; \u201cdo with me what you please; but you dare not, you\r\ncannot raise a finger against the innocent. Begone, I say! let me never\r\nsee you more!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are obeyed. On you fall the consequences.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus, after many months of separation, did Fanny and her lover meet. She\r\nhad purposed when she should see him to make an appeal to his better\r\nnature\u2014his reason; she had meant to use her all-persuasive voice to\r\nrecall him from the dangerous path he was treading. Several times,\r\nindeed, since his arrival in the valley, she had endeavoured to obtain\r\nan interview with him, but he dreaded her influence: he had resolved on\r\nrevenge, and he feared to be turned back. But now the unexpected\r\npresence of his rival robbed her of her self-possession, and forced her\r\nto change her plans. She saw frightful danger in their meeting, and all\r\nher endeavours were directed to the getting rid of her lover.\r\n\r\nLouis and his companions proceeded towards the chateau, while the\r\ncharrette of the fugitives moved on in the opposite direction. They met\r\nmany a ferocious group, who were rushing forward to aid in the\r\ndestruction of their home; and glad they were, in that awful hour, that\r\nany object had power to divert the minds of their enemies from attention\r\nto themselves. The road they pursued wound through the valley; the\r\nprecipitous mountain on one side, a brawling stream on the other. Now\r\nthey ascended higher and now again descended in their route, while the\r\nroad, broken by the fall of rocks, intersected by torrents, which tore\r\ntheir way athwart it, made their progress slow. To get beyond the\r\nvillage was the aim of their desires; when, lo! just as they came upon\r\nit, and were in the very midst of its population, which was pouring\r\ntowards the castle, suddenly the charrette sank in a deep rut; it half\r\nupset, and every spoke in the wheel giving way rendered the vehicle\r\nwholly useless.\r\n\r\nFanny had indeed already sprung to the ground to examine what hope\r\nremained: there was none. \u201cGrand Dieu! we are lost!\u201d were the first\r\nwords that escaped her, while Madame stood aghast, trembling, almost\r\ninsensible, knowing that the hope of her life, the existence of her son,\r\ndepended on these miserable moments.\r\n\r\nA peasant who owed Fanny some kindness now advanced, and in a kind of\r\ncavalier way, as if to blemish as much as he could the matter of his\r\noffer by its manner, told them, that, for the pleasure of getting rid of\r\nthe aristocrats, he would lend his car\u2014there it was, let them quickly\r\nbestow their lading in it and pursue their way. As he spoke, he caught\r\nup a box, and began the transfer from one car to the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no!\u201d cried Madame de Marville, as, with a scream, she sprang\r\nforward and grasped the arm of the man as he was in the very act of\r\ndiscovering her son\u2019s hiding-place. \u201cWe will accept nothing from our\r\nbase enemies!\u2014Begone with your offers! we will die here, rather than\r\naccept anything from such _canaille_.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe word was electric. The fierce passions of the mob, excited by the\r\nmischief they were about to perpetrate, now burst like a stream into\r\nthis new channel. With violent execrations they rushed upon the\r\nunfortunate woman: they would have torn her from the car, but already\r\nher son had sprung from his hiding-place, and, striking a violent blow\r\nat the foremost assailant, checked for a moment their brutal outrages.\r\nThen again, with a yell, such as the savage Indians alone could emulate,\r\nthey rushed on their prey. Mother and son were torn asunder, and cries\r\nof \u201cA bas les aristocrats!\u201d\u2014\u201cA la lanterne!\u201d declared too truly their\r\nsanguinary designs.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Louis appeared\u2014Louis, whose fears for Fanny had overcome\r\nhis indignation, and who returned to guard her; while she, perceiving\r\nhim, with a burst of joy, called on him to rescue her friends. His cry\r\nof \u201cArretez-vous!\u201d was loud and distinct amidst the uproar. It was\r\nobeyed; and then first he beheld his rival, his oppressor, his enemy in\r\nhis power. At first, rage inflamed every feature, to be replaced by an\r\nexpression of triumph and implacable hatred. Fanny caught the fierce\r\nglance of his eye, and grew pale. She trembled as, trying to be calm,\r\nshe said, \u201cYes, you behold he is here. And you must save him\u2014and your\r\nown soul. Rescue him from death, and be blest that your evil career\r\nenables you at least to perform this one good action.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment Louis seemed seeking for a word, as a man, meaning to stab,\r\nmay fumble for his dagger\u2019s hilt, unable in his agitation to grasp his\r\nweapon.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy friends,\u201d at length he said, \u201clet the women depart\u2014we have promised\r\nit. Ye may deal with the young aristocrat according to his merits.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA la lanterne!\u201d burst in response from a hundred voices.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet his mother first depart!\u201d\r\n\r\nCould it be Louis that spoke these words, and had she loved this man? To\r\nappeal to him was to rouse a tiger from his lair. Another thought darted\r\ninto Fanny\u2019s mind; she scarcely knew what she said or did: but already\r\nknives were drawn; already, with a thrill of horror, she thought she saw\r\nthe blood of her childhood\u2019s playmate spilt like water on the earth. She\r\nrushed forward\u2014she caught the upraised arm of one\u2014\u201cHe is no aristocrat!\u201d\r\nshe cried; \u201che is my husband!\u2014Will you murder one who, forgetting his\r\nbirth, his duty, his honour, has married a peasant girl\u2014one of\r\nyourselves?\u201d\r\n\r\nEven this appeal had little effect upon the mob; but it strangely\r\naffected her cruel lover. Grasping her arm with iron fingers, he cried,\r\n\u201cIs this tale true? Art thou married to that man\u2014his wife?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEven so!\u201d\u2014the words died on her lips as she strove to form them,\r\nterrified by their purport, and the effect they might produce. An\r\ninexplicable expression passed over Chaumont\u2019s face; the fierceness that\r\njealousy had engendered for a moment was exalted almost to madness, and\r\nthen faded wholly away. The stony heart within him softened at once. A\r\ntide of warm, human, and overpowering emotion flowed into his soul: he\r\nlooked on her he had loved, on her whom he had lost for ever; and tears\r\nrushed into his eyes, as he saw her trembling before him.\r\n\r\n\u201cFear not,\u201d at last he said; \u201cfear neither for him nor yourself. Poor\r\ngirl! so young, you shall not lose all\u2014so young, you shall not become a\r\nwidow. He shall be saved!\u201d\r\n\r\nYet it was no easy task, even for him, to stem the awakened passions of\r\nthe bloodthirsty mob. He had spent many an hour in exciting them against\r\ntheir seigneurs, and now at once to control the violence to which he had\r\ngiven rise seemed impossible. Yet his energy, his strong will overcame\r\nall opposition. They should pierce the chevalier\u2019s heart, he swore,\r\nthrough his alone. He prevailed. He took the rein of their mule, and led\r\nthem out of the village. All were silent; Fanny knew not what to say,\r\nand surprise held the others mute. Louis went with them until a turn in\r\nthe road hid them from the view of the village. What his thoughts were,\r\nnone could guess: he looked calm, as resigning the rein into the\r\nchevalier\u2019s hands, he gently bade them \u201cFarewell,\u201d touching his hat in\r\nreply to their salutations. They moved on, and Fanny looked back to\r\ncatch a last view of her lover: he was standing where they left him,\r\nwhen suddenly, instead of returning on his steps into the village, she\r\nsaw him with rapid strides ascend the mountain-side, taking a well-known\r\npath that conducted him away from the scene of his late exploits. His\r\npace was that of a man flying from pursuers\u2014soon he was lost to sight.\r\n\r\nAstonishment still kept the fugitives silent, as they pursued their way;\r\nand when at last joy broke forth, and Madame de Marville, rejoicing in\r\ntheir escape, embraced again and again her son, he with the softest\r\ntenderness thanked Fanny for his life: she answered not, but wept\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\nLate that night they reached the destined ch\u00e2let, and found Monsieur de\r\nMarville arrived. It was a half-ruined miserable habitation perched\r\namong the snows, cold and bare; food was ill to be obtained, and danger\r\nbreathed around them. Fanny attended on them with assiduous care, but\r\nshe never spoke of the scene in the village; and though she strove to\r\nlook the same, Henry never addressed her but she grew pale, and her\r\nvoice trembled. She could not divine her absent lover\u2019s thoughts, but\r\nshe knew that he believed her married to another; and that other,\r\nearnestly though she strove to rule her feelings, became an object of\r\nabhorrence to her.\r\n\r\nThree weeks they passed in this wretched abode; three weeks replete with\r\nalarm, for the district around was in arms, and the life of Monsieur de\r\nMarville loudly threatened. They never slept but they dreaded the\r\napproach of the murderers; food they had little, and the inclement\r\nseason visited them roughly. Fanny seemed to feel no inconvenience; her\r\nvoice was cheerful: to console, encourage, and assist her friends\r\nappeared to occupy her whole heart. At length one night they were roused\r\nby a violent knocking at the door of their hut: Monsieur de Marville and\r\nHenry were on their feet in a moment, seizing their weapons as they\r\nrose. It was a domestic of their own, come to communicate the\r\nintelligence that the troubles were over, that the legal government had\r\nreasserted its authority, and invited the governor to return to Berne.\r\n\r\nThey descended from their mountain refuge, and the name of Louis hovered\r\non Fanny\u2019s lips, but she spoke it not. He seemed everywhere forgotten.\r\nIt was not until some time afterwards that she ascertained the fact that\r\nhe had never been seen or heard of since he had parted from her on the\r\nmorning of their escape. The villagers had waited for him in vain; they\r\nsuspended their designs, for they all depended upon him; but he came\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nMonsieur and Madame de Marville returned to their chateau with their\r\nson, but Fanny remained behind. She would not inhabit the same roof as\r\nHenry; she recoiled even from receiving further benefits from his\r\nparents. What could she do? Louis would doubtless discover the falsehood\r\nof her marriage, but he dared not return; and even if he communicated\r\nwith her, even though yet she loved him, could she unite herself with\r\none accused too truly of the most frightful crimes? At first, these\r\ndoubts agitated her, but by degrees they faded as oblivion closed over\r\nChaumont\u2019s name; and he came not, and she heard not of him, and he was\r\nas dead to her. Then the memory of the past revived in her heart; her\r\nlove awoke with her despair; his mysterious flight became the sole\r\noccupation of her thoughts; time rolled on and brought its changes.\r\nMadame de Marville died\u2014Henry was united to another\u2014Fanny remained, to\r\nher own thoughts, alone in the world. A relation, who lived at Subiaco,\r\nsent for her, and there she went to take up her abode. In vain she\r\nstrove to wean herself from the memory of Louis\u2014her love for him haunted\r\nher soul.\r\n\r\nThere was war in Europe, and every man was converted into a soldier; the\r\ncountry was thinned of its inhabitants, and each victory or defeat\r\nbrought a new conscription. At length peace came again, and its return\r\nwas celebrated with rejoicing. Many a soldier returned to his home\u2014and\r\none came back who had no home. A man, evidently suffering from recent\r\nwounds, wayworn and sick, asked for hospitality at Fanny\u2019s cottage; it\r\nwas readily afforded, and he sat at her cottage fire, and removed his\r\ncap from his brow. His person was bent, his cheeks fallen in; yet those\r\neyes of fire, that quick animated look, which almost brought the bright\r\nexpression of youth back into his face, could never be forgotten. Fanny\r\ngazed almost in alarm, and then in joy, and at last, in her own sweet\r\nvoice, she said, \u201cEt toi, Louis\u2014tu aussi es de retour.\u201d\r\n\r\nLouis had endured many a sorrow and many a hardship, and, most of all,\r\nhe had been called on to wage battle with his own fierce spirit. The\r\nrage and hate which he had sedulously nourished suddenly became his\r\ntormentors and his tyrants\u2014at the moment that love, before too closely\r\nallied to them, emancipated itself from their control. Love, which is\r\nthe source of all that is most generous and noble in our nature, of\r\nself-devotion and of high intent, separated from the alloy he had\r\nblended with it, asserted its undivided power over him; strange that it\r\nshould be so at the moment that he believed that he had lost her he\r\nloved for ever!\r\n\r\nAll his plans had been built for revenge. He would destroy the family\r\nthat oppressed him; unbuild, stone by stone, the proud abode of their\r\ninheritance; he would be the sole refuge and support of his mistress in\r\nexile and in poverty. He had entered upon his criminal career with this\r\ndesign alone, and with the anticipation of ending all by heaping\r\nbenefits and the gifts of fortune upon Fanny. The very steps he had\r\ntaken, he now believed to be those that occasioned his defeat. He had\r\nlost her\u2014the lovely and the good\u2014he had lost her by proving unworthy,\r\nyet not so unworthy was he as to make her the victim of his crimes. The\r\nfamily he had vowed to ruin was now hers, and every injury that befell\r\nthem visited her; to save her he must unweave his pernicious webs; to\r\nkeep her scatheless, his dearest designs must fall to the ground.\r\n\r\nA veil seemed rent before his eyes; he had fled, for he would not assist\r\nin the destruction of her fortunes; he had not returned, for it was\r\ntorture to him to know that she lived, the wife of another. He entered\r\nthe French army, but in every change his altered feelings pursued him,\r\nand to prove himself worthy of her he had lost was the constant aim of\r\nhis ambition. His excellent conduct led to his promotion, and yet mishap\r\nstill waited on him. He was wounded, even dangerously, and became so\r\nincapable of service as to be forced to solicit his dismission. This had\r\noccurred at the end of a hard campaign in Germany, and his intention was\r\nto pass into Italy, where a friend, with whom he had formed an intimacy\r\nin the army, promised to procure him some employment under Government.\r\nHe passed through Subiaco in his way, and, ignorant of its occupiers,\r\nhad asked for hospitality in his mistress\u2019s cottage.\r\n\r\nIf guilt can be expiated by repentance and reform, as is the best lesson\r\nof religion, Louis had expiated his. If constancy in love deserve\r\nreward, these lovers deserved that, which they reaped, in the happiness\r\nconsequent on their union. Her image, side by side with all that is good\r\nin our nature, had dwelt in his heart, which thus became a shrine at\r\nwhich he sacrificed every evil passion. It was a greater bliss than he\r\nhad ever dared to anticipate, to find, that in so doing, he had at the\r\nsame time been conducing to the welfare of her he loved, and that the\r\nlost and idolized being whom he worshipped founded the happiness of her\r\nlife upon his return to virtue, and the constancy of his affection.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XI.\r\n\r\n                         _THE INVISIBLE GIRL._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS slender narrative has no pretensions to the regularity of a story,\r\nor the development of situations and feelings; it is but a slight\r\nsketch, delivered nearly as it was narrated to me by one of the humblest\r\nof the actors concerned: nor will I spin out a circumstance interesting\r\nprincipally from its singularity and truth, but narrate, as concisely as\r\nI can, how I was surprised on visiting what seemed a ruined tower,\r\ncrowning a bleak promontory overhanging the sea, that flows between\r\nWales and Ireland, to find that though the exterior preserved all the\r\nsavage rudeness that betokened many a war with the elements, the\r\ninterior was fitted up somewhat in the guise of a summer-house, for it\r\nwas too small to deserve any other name. It consisted but of the\r\nground-floor, which served as an entrance, and one room above, which was\r\nreached by a staircase made out of the thickness of the wall. This\r\nchamber was floored and carpeted, decorated with elegant furniture; and,\r\nabove all, to attract the attention and excite curiosity, there hung\r\nover the chimney-piece\u2014for to preserve the apartment from damp a\r\nfireplace had been built evidently since it had assumed a guise so\r\ndissimilar to the object of its construction\u2014a picture simply painted in\r\nwater-colours, which deemed more than any part of the adornments of the\r\nroom to be at war with the rudeness of the building, the solitude in\r\nwhich it was placed, and the desolation of the surrounding scenery. This\r\ndrawing represented a lovely girl in the very pride and bloom of youth;\r\nher dress was simple, in the fashion of the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury; her countenance was embellished by a look of mingled innocence\r\nand intelligence, to which was added the imprint of serenity of soul and\r\nnatural cheerfulness. She was reading one of those folio romances which\r\nhave so long been the delight of the enthusiastic and young; her\r\nmandoline was at her feet\u2014her parroquet perched on a huge mirror near\r\nher; the arrangement of furniture and hangings gave token of a luxurious\r\ndwelling, and her attire also evidently that of home and privacy, yet\r\nbore with it an appearance of ease and girlish ornament, as if she\r\nwished to please. Beneath this picture was inscribed in golden letters,\r\n\u201cThe Invisible Girl.\u201d\r\n\r\nRambling about a country nearly uninhabited, having lost my way, and\r\nbeing overtaken by a shower, I had lighted on this dreary-looking\r\ntenement, which seemed to rock in the blast, and to be hung up there as\r\nthe very symbol of desolation. I was gazing wistfully and cursing\r\ninwardly my stars which led me to a ruin that could afford no shelter,\r\nthough the storm began to pelt more seriously than before, when I saw an\r\nold woman\u2019s head popped out from a kind of loophole, and as suddenly\r\nwithdrawn;\u2014a minute after a feminine voice called to me from within, and\r\npenetrating a little brambly maze that screened a door, which I had not\r\nbefore observed, so skilfully had the planter succeeded in concealing\r\nart with nature, I found the good dame standing on the threshold and\r\ninviting me to take refuge within. \u201cI had just come up from our cot hard\r\nby,\u201d she said, \u201cto look after the things, as I do every day, when the\r\nrain came on\u2014will ye walk up till it is over?\u201d I was about to observe\r\nthat the cot hard by, at the venture of a few rain drops, was better\r\nthan a ruined tower, and to ask my kind hostess whether \u201cthe things\u201d\r\nwere pigeons or crows that she was come to look after, when the matting\r\nof the floor and the carpeting of the staircase struck my eye. I was\r\nstill more surprised when I saw the room above; and beyond all, the\r\npicture and its singular inscription, naming her invisible, whom the\r\npainter had coloured forth into very agreeable visibility, awakened my\r\nmost lively curiosity; the result of this, of my exceeding politeness\r\ntowards the old woman, and her own natural garrulity, was a kind of\r\ngarbled narrative which my imagination eked out, and future inquiries\r\nrectified, till it assumed the following form.\r\n\r\nSome years before, in the afternoon of a September day, which, though\r\ntolerably fair, gave many tokens of a tempestuous night, a gentleman\r\narrived at a little coast town about ten miles from this place; he\r\nexpressed his desire to hire a boat to carry him to the town of \u2014\u2014 about\r\nfifteen miles farther on the coast. The menaces which the sky held forth\r\nmade the fishermen loathe to venture, till at length two, one the father\r\nof a numerous family, bribed by the bountiful reward the stranger\r\npromised, the other, the son of my hostess, induced by youthful daring,\r\nagreed to undertake the voyage. The wind was fair, and they hoped to\r\nmake good way before nightfall, and to get into port ere the rising of\r\nthe storm. They pushed off with good cheer, at least the fishermen did;\r\nas for the stranger, the deep mourning which he wore was not half so\r\nblack as the melancholy that wrapt his mind. He looked as if he had\r\nnever smiled\u2014as if some unutterable thought, dark as night and bitter as\r\ndeath, had built its nest within his bosom, and brooded therein\r\neternally; he did not mention his name; but one of the villagers\r\nrecognised him as Henry Vernon, the son of a baronet who possessed a\r\nmansion about three miles distant from the town for which he was bound.\r\nThis mansion was almost abandoned by the family; but Henry had, in a\r\nromantic fit, visited it about three years before, and Sir Peter had\r\nbeen down there during the previous spring for about a couple of months.\r\n\r\nThe boat did not make so much way as was expected; the breeze failed\r\nthem as they got out to sea, and they were fain with oar as well as sail\r\nto try to weather the promontory that jutted out between them and the\r\nspot they desired to reach. They were yet far distant when the shifting\r\nwind began to exert its strength, and to blow with violent though\r\nunequal blasts. Night came on pitchy dark, and the howling waves rose\r\nand broke with frightful violence, menacing to overwhelm the tiny bark\r\nthat dared resist their fury. They were forced to lower every sail, and\r\ntake to their oars; one man was obliged to bale out the water, and\r\nVernon himself took an oar, and rowing with desperate energy, equalled\r\nthe force of the more practised boatmen. There had been much talk\r\nbetween the sailors before the tempest came on; now, except a brief\r\ncommand, all were silent. One thought of his wife and children, and\r\nsilently cursed the caprice of the stranger that endangered in its\r\neffects, not only his life, but their welfare; the other feared less,\r\nfor he was a daring lad, but he worked hard, and had no time for speech;\r\nwhile Vernon bitterly regretting the thoughtlessness which had made him\r\ncause others to share a peril, unimportant as far as he himself was\r\nconcerned, now tried to cheer them with a voice full of animation and\r\ncourage, and now pulled yet more strongly at the oar he held. The only\r\nperson who did not seem wholly intent on the work he was about, was the\r\nman who baled; every now and then he gazed intently round, as if the sea\r\nheld afar off, on its tumultuous waste, some object that he strained his\r\neyes to discern. But all was blank, except as the crests of the high\r\nwaves showed themselves, or far out on the verge of the horizon, a kind\r\nof lifting of the clouds betokened greater violence for the blast. At\r\nlength he exclaimed, \u201cYes, I see it!\u2014the larboard oar!\u2014now! if we can\r\nmake yonder light, we are saved!\u201d Both the rowers instinctively turned\r\ntheir heads,\u2014but cheerless darkness answered their gaze.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou cannot see it,\u201d cried their companion, \u201cbut we are nearing it; and,\r\nplease God, we shall outlive this night.\u201d Soon he took the oar from\r\nVernon\u2019s hand, who, quite exhausted, was failing in his strokes. He rose\r\nand looked for the beacon which promised them safety;\u2014it glimmered with\r\nso faint a ray, that now he said, \u201cI see it;\u201d and again, \u201cit is\r\nnothing:\u201d still, as they made way, it dawned upon his sight, growing\r\nmore steady and distinct as it beamed across the lurid waters, which\r\nthemselves became smoother, so that safety seemed to arise from the\r\nbosom of the ocean under the influence of that flickering gleam.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat beacon is it that helps us at our need?\u201d asked Vernon, as the men,\r\nnow able to manage their oars with greater ease, found breath to answer\r\nhis question.\r\n\r\n\u201cA fairy one, I believe,\u201d replied the elder sailor, \u201cyet no less a true:\r\nit burns in an old tumble-down tower, built on the top of a rock which\r\nlooks over the sea. We never saw it before this summer; and now each\r\nnight it is to be seen,\u2014at least when it is looked for, for we cannot\r\nsee it from our village;\u2014and it is such an out-of-the-way place that no\r\none has need to go near it, except through a chance like this. Some say\r\nit is burnt by witches, some say by smugglers; but this I know, two\r\nparties have been to search, and found nothing but the bare walls of the\r\ntower. All is deserted by day, and dark by night; for no light was to be\r\nseen while we were there, though it burned sprightly enough when we were\r\nout at sea.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have heard say,\u201d observed the younger sailor, \u201cit is burnt by the\r\nghost of a maiden who lost her sweetheart in these parts; he being\r\nwrecked, and his body found at the foot of the tower: she goes by the\r\nname among us of the \u2018Invisible Girl.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nThe voyagers had now reached the landing-place at the foot of the tower.\r\nVernon cast a glance upward,\u2014the light was still burning. With some\r\ndifficulty, struggling with the breakers, and blinded by night, they\r\ncontrived to get their little bark to shore, and to draw her up on the\r\nbeach. They then scrambled up the precipitous pathway, overgrown by\r\nweeds and underwood, and, guided by the more experienced fisherman, they\r\nfound the entrance to the tower; door or gate there was none, and all\r\nwas dark as the tomb, and silent and almost as cold as death.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis will never do,\u201d said Vernon; \u201csurely our hostess will show her\r\nlight, if not herself, and guide our darkling steps by some sign of life\r\nand comfort.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will get to the upper chamber,\u201d said the sailor, \u201cif I can but hit\r\nupon the broken-down steps; but you will find no trace of the Invisible\r\nGirl nor her light either, I warrant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTruly a romantic adventure of the most disagreeable kind,\u201d muttered\r\nVernon, as he stumbled over the unequal ground; \u201cshe of the beacon-light\r\nmust be both ugly and old, or she would not be so peevish and\r\ninhospitable.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith considerable difficulty, and after divers knocks and bruises, the\r\nadventurers at length succeeded in reaching the upper storey; but all\r\nwas blank and bare, and they were fain to stretch themselves on the hard\r\nfloor, when weariness, both of mind and body, conduced to steep their\r\nsenses in sleep.\r\n\r\nLong and sound were the slumbers of the mariners. Vernon but forgot\r\nhimself for an hour; then throwing off drowsiness, and finding his rough\r\ncouch uncongenial to repose, he got up and placed himself at the hole\r\nthat served for a window\u2014for glass there was none, and there being not\r\neven a rough bench, he leant his back against the embrasure, as the only\r\nrest he could find. He had forgotten his danger, the mysterious beacon,\r\nand its invisible guardian: his thoughts were occupied on the horrors of\r\nhis own fate, and the unspeakable wretchedness that sat like a nightmare\r\non his heart.\r\n\r\nIt would require a good-sized volume to relate the causes which had\r\nchanged the once happy Vernon into the most woful mourner that ever\r\nclung to the outer trappings of grief, as slight though cherished\r\nsymbols of the wretchedness within. Henry was the only child of Sir\r\nPeter Vernon, and as much spoiled by his father\u2019s idolatry as the old\r\nbaronet\u2019s violent and tyrannical temper would permit. A young orphan was\r\neducated in his father\u2019s house, who in the same way was treated with\r\ngenerosity and kindness, and yet who lived in deep awe of Sir Peter\u2019s\r\nauthority, who was a widower; and these two children were all he had to\r\nexert his power over, or to whom to extend his affection. Rosina was a\r\ncheerful-tempered girl, a little timid, and careful to avoid displeasing\r\nher protector; but so docile, so kind-hearted, and so affectionate, that\r\nshe felt even less than Henry the discordant spirit of his parent. It is\r\na tale often told; they were playmates and companions in childhood, and\r\nlovers in after days. Rosina was frightened to imagine that this secret\r\naffection, and the vows they pledged, might be disapproved of by Sir\r\nPeter. But sometimes she consoled herself by thinking that perhaps she\r\nwas in reality her Henry\u2019s destined bride, brought up with him under the\r\ndesign of their future union; and Henry, while he felt that this was not\r\nthe case, resolved to wait only until he was of age to declare and\r\naccomplish his wishes in making the sweet Rosina his wife. Meanwhile he\r\nwas careful to avoid premature discovery of his intentions, so to secure\r\nhis beloved girl from persecution and insult. The old gentleman was very\r\nconveniently blind; he lived always in the country, and the lovers spent\r\ntheir lives together, unrebuked and uncontrolled. It was enough that\r\nRosina played on her mandoline, and sang Sir Peter to sleep every day\r\nafter dinner; she was the sole female in the house above the rank of a\r\nservant, and had her own way in the disposal of her time. Even when Sir\r\nPeter frowned, her innocent caresses and sweet voice were powerful to\r\nsmooth the rough current of his temper. If ever human spirit lived in an\r\nearthly paradise, Rosina did at this time: her pure love was made happy\r\nby Henry\u2019s constant presence; and the confidence they felt in each\r\nother, and the security with which they looked forward to the future,\r\nrendered their path one of roses under a cloudless sky. Sir Peter was\r\nthe slight drawback that only rendered their _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_ more\r\ndelightful, and gave value to the sympathy they each bestowed on the\r\nother. All at once an ominous personage made its appearance in Vernon\r\nPlace, in the shape of a widow sister of Sir Peter, who, having\r\nsucceeded in killing her husband and children with the effects of her\r\nvile temper, came, like a harpy, greedy for new prey, under her\r\nbrother\u2019s roof. She too soon detected the attachment of the unsuspicious\r\npair. She made all speed to impart her discovery to her brother, and at\r\nonce to restrain and inflame his rage. Through her contrivance Henry was\r\nsuddenly despatched on his travels abroad, that the coast might be clear\r\nfor the persecution of Rosina; and then the richest of the lovely girl\u2019s\r\nmany admirers, whom, under Sir Peter\u2019s single reign, she was allowed,\r\nnay, almost commanded, to dismiss, so desirous was he of keeping her for\r\nhis own comfort, was selected, and she was ordered to marry him. The\r\nscenes of violence to which she was now exposed, the bitter taunts of\r\nthe odious Mrs. Bainbridge, and the reckless fury of Sir Peter, were the\r\nmore frightful and overwhelming from their novelty. To all she could\r\nonly oppose a silent, tearful, but immutable steadiness of purpose: no\r\nthreats, no rage could extort from her more than a touching prayer that\r\nthey would not hate her, because she could not obey.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere must be something we don\u2019t see under all this,\u201d said Mrs.\r\nBainbridge; \u201ctake my word for it, brother, she corresponds secretly with\r\nHenry. Let us take her down to your seat in Wales, where she will have\r\nno pensioned beggars to assist her; and we shall see if her spirit be\r\nnot bent to our purpose.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir Peter consented, and they all three took up their abode in the\r\nsolitary and dreary-looking house before alluded to as belonging to the\r\nfamily. Here poor Rosina\u2019s sufferings grew intolerable. Before,\r\nsurrounded by well-known scenes, and in perpetual intercourse with kind\r\nand familiar faces, she had not despaired in the end of conquering by\r\nher patience the cruelty of her persecutors;\u2014nor had she written to\r\nHenry, for his name had not been mentioned by his relatives, nor their\r\nattachment alluded to, and she felt an instinctive wish to escape the\r\ndangers about her without his being annoyed, or the sacred secret of her\r\nlove being laid bare, and wronged by the vulgar abuse of his aunt or the\r\nbitter curses of his father. But when she was taken to Wales, and made a\r\nprisoner in her apartment, when the flinty mountains about her seemed\r\nfeebly to imitate the stony hearts she had to deal with, her courage\r\nbegan to fail. The only attendant permitted to approach her was Mrs.\r\nBainbridge\u2019s maid; and under the tutelage of her fiend-like mistress,\r\nthis woman was used as a decoy to entice the poor prisoner into\r\nconfidence, and then to be betrayed. The simple, kind-hearted Rosina was\r\na facile dupe, and at last, in the excess of her despair, wrote to\r\nHenry, and gave the letter to this woman to be forwarded. The letter in\r\nitself would have softened marble; it did not speak of their mutual\r\nvows, it but asked him to intercede with his father, that he would\r\nrestore her to the place she had formerly held in his affections, and\r\ncease from a cruelty that would destroy her. \u201cFor I may die,\u201d wrote the\r\nhapless girl, \u201cbut marry another\u2014never!\u201d That single word, indeed, had\r\nsufficed to betray her secret, had it not been already discovered; as it\r\nwas, it gave increased fury to Sir Peter, as his sister triumphantly\r\npointed it out to him, for it need hardly be said that while the ink of\r\nthe address was yet wet, and the seal still warm, Rosina\u2019s letter was\r\ncarried to this lady. The culprit was summoned before them. What ensued\r\nnone could tell; for their own sakes the cruel pair tried to palliate\r\ntheir part. Voices were high, and the soft murmur of Rosina\u2019s tone was\r\nlost in the howling of Sir Peter and the snarling of his sister. \u201cOut of\r\ndoors you shall go,\u201d roared the old man; \u201cunder my roof you shall not\r\nspend another night.\u201d And the words infamous seductress, and worse, such\r\nas had never met the poor girl\u2019s ear before, were caught by listening\r\nservants; and to each angry speech of the baronet, Mrs. Bainbridge added\r\nan envenomed point worse than all.\r\n\r\nMore dead then alive, Rosina was at last dismissed. Whether guided by\r\ndespair, whether she took Sir Peter\u2019s threats literally, or whether his\r\nsister\u2019s orders were more decisive, none knew, but Rosina left the\r\nhouse; a servant saw her cross the park, weeping, and wringing her hands\r\nas she went. What became of her none could tell; her disappearance was\r\nnot disclosed to Sir Peter till the following day, and then he showed by\r\nhis anxiety to trace her steps and to find her, that his words had been\r\nbut idle threats. The truth was, that though Sir Peter went to frightful\r\nlengths to prevent the marriage of the heir of his house with the\r\nportionless orphan, the object of his charity, yet in his heart he loved\r\nRosina, and half his violence to her rose from anger at himself for\r\ntreating her so ill. Now remorse began to sting him, as messenger after\r\nmessenger came back without tidings of his victim. He dared not confess\r\nhis worst fears to himself; and when his inhuman sister, trying to\r\nharden her conscience by angry words, cried, \u201cThe vile hussy has too\r\nsurely made away with herself out of revenge to us,\u201d an oath the most\r\ntremendous, and a look sufficient to make even her tremble, commanded\r\nher silence. Her conjecture, however, appeared too true: a dark and\r\nrushing stream that flowed at the extremity of the park had doubtless\r\nreceived the lovely form, and quenched the life of this unfortunate\r\ngirl. Sir Peter, when his endeavours to find her proved fruitless,\r\nreturned to town, haunted by the image of his victim, and forced to\r\nacknowledge in his own heart that he would willingly lay down his life,\r\ncould he see her again, even though it were as the bride of his son\u2014his\r\nson, before whose questioning he quailed like the veriest coward; for\r\nwhen Henry was told of the death of Rosina, he suddenly returned from\r\nabroad to ask the cause\u2014to visit her grave, and mourn her loss in the\r\ngroves and valleys which had been the scenes of their mutual happiness.\r\nHe made a thousand inquiries, and an ominous silence alone replied.\r\nGrowing more earnest and more anxious, at length he drew from servants\r\nand dependents, and his odious aunt herself, the whole dreadful truth.\r\nFrom that moment despair struck his heart, and misery named him her own.\r\nHe fled from his father\u2019s presence; and the recollection that one whom\r\nhe ought to revere was guilty of so dark a crime, haunted him, as of old\r\nthe Eumenides tormented the souls of men given up to their torturings.\r\nHis first, his only wish, was to visit Wales, and to learn if any new\r\ndiscovery had been made, and whether it were possible to recover the\r\nmortal remains of the lost Rosina, so to satisfy the unquiet longings of\r\nhis miserable heart. On this expedition was he bound when he made his\r\nappearance at the village before named; and now, in the deserted tower,\r\nhis thoughts were busy with images of despair and death, and what his\r\nbeloved one had suffered before her gentle nature had been goaded to\r\nsuch a deed of woe.\r\n\r\nWhile immersed in gloomy reverie, to which the monotonous roaring of the\r\nsea made fit accompaniment, hours flew on, and Vernon was at last aware\r\nthat the light of morning was creeping from out its eastern retreat, and\r\ndawning over the wild ocean, which still broke in furious tumult on the\r\nrocky beach. His companions now roused themselves, and prepared to\r\ndepart. The food they had brought with them was damaged by sea-water,\r\nand their hunger, after hard labour and many hours\u2019 fasting, had become\r\nravenous. It was impossible to put to sea in their shattered boat; but\r\nthere stood a fisher\u2019s cot about two miles off, in a recess in the bay,\r\nof which the promontory on which the tower stood formed one side; and to\r\nthis they hastened to repair. They did not spend a second thought on the\r\nlight which had saved them, nor its cause, but left the ruin in search\r\nof a more hospitable asylum. Vernon cast his eyes round as he quitted\r\nit, but no vestige of an inhabitant met his eye, and he began to\r\npersuade himself that the beacon had been a creation of fancy merely.\r\nArriving at the cottage in question, which was inhabited by a fisherman\r\nand his family, they made a homely breakfast, and then prepared to\r\nreturn to the tower, to refit their boat, and, if possible, bring her\r\nround. Vernon accompanied them, together with their host and his son.\r\nSeveral questions were asked concerning the Invisible Girl and her\r\nlight, each agreeing that the apparition was novel, and not one being\r\nable to give even an explanation of how the name had become affixed to\r\nthe unknown cause of this singular appearance; though both of the men of\r\nthe cottage affirmed that once or twice they had seen a female figure in\r\nthe adjacent wood, and that now and then a stranger girl made her\r\nappearance at another cot a mile off, on the other side of the\r\npromontory, and bought bread; they suspected both these to be the same,\r\nbut could not tell. The inhabitants of the cot, indeed, appeared too\r\nstupid even to feel curiosity, and had never made any attempt at\r\ndiscovery. The whole day was spent by the sailors in repairing the boat;\r\nand the sound of hammers, and the voices of the men at work, resounded\r\nalong the coast, mingled with the dashing of the waves. This was no time\r\nto explore the ruin for one who, whether human or supernatural, so\r\nevidently withdrew herself from intercourse with every living being.\r\nVernon, however, went over the tower, and searched every nook in vain.\r\nThe dingy bare walls bore no token of serving as a shelter; and even a\r\nlittle recess in the wall of the staircase, which he had not before\r\nobserved, was equally empty and desolate. Quitting the tower, he\r\nwandered in the pine wood that surrounded it, and, giving up all thought\r\nof solving the mystery, was soon engrossed by thoughts that touched his\r\nheart more nearly, when suddenly there appeared on the ground at his\r\nfeet the vision of a slipper. Since Cinderella so tiny a slipper had\r\nnever been seen; as plain as shoe could speak, it told a tale of\r\nelegance, loveliness, and youth. Vernon picked it up. He had often\r\nadmired Rosina\u2019s singularly small foot, and his first thought was a\r\nquestion whether this little slipper would have fitted it. It was very\r\nstrange!\u2014it must belong to the Invisible Girl. Then there was a fairy\r\nform that kindled that light\u2014a form of such material substance that its\r\nfoot needed to be shod; and yet how shod?\u2014with kid so fine, and of shape\r\nso exquisite, that it exactly resembled such as Rosina wore! Again the\r\nrecurrence of the image of the beloved dead came forcibly across him;\r\nand a thousand home-felt associations, childish yet sweet, and\r\nlover-like though trifling, so filled Vernon\u2019s heart, that he threw\r\nhimself his length on the ground, and wept more bitterly than ever the\r\nmiserable fate of the sweet orphan.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the men quitted their work, and Vernon returned with them\r\nto the cot where they were to sleep, intending to pursue their voyage,\r\nweather permitting, the following morning. Vernon said nothing of his\r\nslipper, but returned with his rough associates. Often he looked back;\r\nbut the tower rose darkly over the dim waves, and no light appeared.\r\nPreparations had been made in the cot for their accommodation, and the\r\nonly bed in it was offered Vernon; but he refused to deprive his\r\nhostess, and, spreading his cloak on a heap of dry leaves, endeavoured\r\nto give himself up to repose. He slept for some hours; and when he\r\nawoke, all was still, save that the hard breathing of the sleepers in\r\nthe same room with him interrupted the silence. He rose, and, going to\r\nthe window, looked out over the now placid sea towards the mystic tower.\r\nThe light was burning there, sending its slender rays across the waves.\r\nCongratulating himself on a circumstance he had not anticipated, Vernon\r\nsoftly left the cottage, and, wrapping his cloak round him, walked with\r\na swift pace round the bay towards the tower. He reached it; still the\r\nlight was burning. To enter and restore the maiden her shoe, would be\r\nbut an act of courtesy; and Vernon intended to do this with such caution\r\nas to come unaware, before its wearer could, with her accustomed arts,\r\nwithdraw herself from his eyes; but, unluckily, while yet making his way\r\nup the narrow pathway, his foot dislodged a loose fragment, that fell\r\nwith crash and sound down the precipice. He sprung forward, on this, to\r\nretrieve by speed the advantage he had lost by this unlucky accident. He\r\nreached the door; he entered: all was silent, but also all was dark. He\r\npaused in the room below; he felt sure that a slight sound met his ear.\r\nHe ascended the steps, and entered the upper chamber; but blank\r\nobscurity met his penetrating gaze, the starless night admitted not even\r\na twilight glimmer through the only aperture. He closed his eyes, to\r\ntry, on opening them again, to be able to catch some faint, wandering\r\nray on the visual nerve; but it was in vain. He groped round the room;\r\nhe stood still, and held his breath; and then, listening intently, he\r\nfelt sure that another occupied the chamber with him, and that its\r\natmosphere was slightly agitated by another\u2019s respiration. He remembered\r\nthe recess in the staircase; but before he approached it he spoke;\u2014he\r\nhesitated a moment what to say. \u201cI must believe,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\r\nmisfortune alone can cause your seclusion; and if the assistance of a\r\nman\u2014of a gentleman\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\nAn exclamation interrupted him; a voice from the grave spoke his\r\nname\u2014the accents of Rosina syllabled, \u201cHenry!\u2014is it indeed Henry whom I\r\nhear?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe rushed forward, directed by the sound, and clasped in his arms the\r\nliving form of his own lamented girl\u2014his own Invisible Girl he called\r\nher; for even yet, as he felt her heart beat near his, and as he\r\nentwined her waist with his arm, supporting her as she almost sank to\r\nthe ground with agitation, he could not see her; and, as her sobs\r\nprevented her speech, no sense but the instinctive one that filled his\r\nheart with tumultuous gladness, told him that the slender, wasted form\r\nhe pressed so fondly was the living shadow of the Hebe beauty he had\r\nadored.\r\n\r\nThe morning saw this pair thus strangely restored to each other on the\r\ntranquil sea, sailing with a fair wind for L\u2014\u2014, whence they were to\r\nproceed to Sir Peter\u2019s seat, which, three months before, Rosina had\r\nquitted in such agony and terror. The morning light dispelled the\r\nshadows that had veiled her, and disclosed the fair person of the\r\nInvisible Girl. Altered indeed she was by suffering and woe, but still\r\nthe same sweet smile played on her lips, and the tender light of her\r\nsoft blue eyes were all her own. Vernon drew out the slipper, and showed\r\nthe cause that had occasioned him to resolve to discover the guardian of\r\nthe mystic beacon; even now he dared not inquire how she had existed in\r\nthat desolate spot, or wherefore she had so sedulously avoided\r\nobservation, when the right thing to have been done was to have sought\r\nhim immediately, under whose care, protected by whose love, no danger\r\nneed be feared. But Rosina shrunk from him as he spoke, and a deathlike\r\npallor came over her cheek, as she faintly whispered, \u201cYour father\u2019s\r\ncurse\u2014your father\u2019s dreadful threats!\u201d It appeared, indeed, that Sir\r\nPeter\u2019s violence, and the cruelty of Mrs. Bainbridge, had succeeded in\r\nimpressing Rosina with wild and unvanquishable terror. She had fled from\r\ntheir house without plan or forethought\u2014driven by frantic horror and\r\noverwhelming fear, she had left it with scarcely any money, and there\r\nseemed to her no possibility of either returning or proceeding onward.\r\nShe had no friend except Henry in the wide world; whither could she\r\ngo?\u2014to have sought Henry would have sealed their fates to misery; for,\r\nwith an oath, Sir Peter had declared he would rather see them both in\r\ntheir coffins than married. After wandering about, hiding by day, and\r\nonly venturing forth at night, she had come to this deserted tower,\r\nwhich seemed a place of refuge. How she had lived since then she could\r\nhardly tell: she had lingered in the woods by day, or slept in the vault\r\nof the tower, an asylum none were acquainted with or had discovered: by\r\nnight she burned the pinecones of the wood, and night was her dearest\r\ntime; for it seemed to her as if security came with darkness. She was\r\nunaware that Sir Peter had left that part of the country, and was\r\nterrified lest her hiding-place should be revealed to him. Her only hope\r\nwas that Henry would return\u2014that Henry would never rest till he had\r\nfound her. She confessed that the long interval and the approach of\r\nwinter had visited her with dismay; she feared that, as her strength was\r\nfailing, and her form wasting to a skeleton, that she might die, and\r\nnever see her own Henry more.\r\n\r\nAn illness, indeed, in spite of all his care, followed her restoration\r\nto security and the comforts of civilised life; many months went by\r\nbefore the bloom revisiting her cheeks, and her limbs regaining their\r\nroundness, she resembled once more the picture drawn of her in her days\r\nof bliss before any visitation of sorrow. It was a copy of this portrait\r\nthat decorated the tower, the scene of her suffering, in which I had\r\nfound shelter. Sir Peter, overjoyed to be relieved from the pangs of\r\nremorse, and delighted again to see his orphan ward, whom he really\r\nloved, was now as eager as before he had been averse to bless her union\r\nwith his son. Mrs. Bainbridge they never saw again. But each year they\r\nspent a few months in their Welsh mansion, the scene of their early\r\nwedded happiness, and the spot where again poor Rosina had awoke to life\r\nand joy after her cruel persecutions. Henry\u2019s fond care had fitted up\r\nthe tower, and decorated it as I saw; and often did he come over, with\r\nhis \u201cInvisible Girl,\u201d to renew, in the very scene of its occurrence, the\r\nremembrance of all the incidents which had led to their meeting again,\r\nduring the shades of night, in that sequestered ruin.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XII.\r\n\r\n                       _THE BROTHER AND SISTER._\r\n\r\n                           AN ITALIAN STORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is well known that the hatred borne by one family against another,\r\nand the strife of parties, which often led to bloodshed in the Italian\r\ncities during the Middle Ages, so vividly described by Shakespeare in\r\n\u201cRomeo and Juliet,\u201d was not confined to the Montecchi and Ciapelletti of\r\nVerona, but existed with equal animosity in almost every other town of\r\nthat beautiful peninsula. The greatest men among them were the victims;\r\nand crowds of exiles\u2014families who but the day before were in the full\r\nenjoyment of the luxuries of life and the endearing associations of\r\nhome\u2014were every now and then seen issuing from the gates of their native\r\ncities, deprived of every possession, and with melancholy and slow steps\r\ndragging their wearied limbs to the nearest asylum offered them, thence\r\nto commence a new career of dependence and poverty, to endure to the end\r\nof their lives, or until some lucky accident should enable them to\r\nchange places with their enemies, making those the sufferers who were\r\nlate the tyrants. In that country, where each town formed an independent\r\nState, to change one for the other was to depart from the spot cherished\r\nas a country and a home for distant banishment\u2014or worse; for as each\r\ncity entertained either hatred or contempt for its neighbour, it often\r\nhappened that the mourning exile was obliged to take up his abode among\r\na people whom he had injured or scoffed. Foreign service offered a\r\nresource to the young and bold among the men. But lovely Italy was to be\r\nleft, the ties of young hearts severed, and all the endearing\r\nassociations of kin and country broken and scattered for ever. The\r\nItalians were always peculiarly susceptible to these misfortunes. They\r\nloved their native walls, the abodes of their ancestors, the familiar\r\nscenes of youth, with all the passionate fervour characteristic of that\r\nclime.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore no uncommon thing for any one among them, like Foscari\r\nof Venice, to prefer destitution and danger in their own city, to a\r\nprecarious subsistence among strangers in distant lands; or, if\r\ncompelled to quit the beloved precincts of their native walls, still to\r\nhover near, ready to avail themselves of the first occasion that should\r\npresent itself for reversing the decree that condemned them to misery.\r\n\r\nFor three days and nights there had been warfare in the streets of\r\nSiena,\u2014blood flowed in torrents,\u2014yet the cries and groans of the fallen\r\nbut excited their friends to avenge them\u2014not their foes to spare. On the\r\nfourth morning, Ugo Mancini, with a scanty band of followers, was driven\r\nfrom the town; succours from Florence had arrived for his enemies, and\r\nhe was forced to yield. Burning with rage, writhing with an impotent\r\nthirst for vengeance, Ugo went round to the neighbouring villages to\r\nrouse them, not against his native town, but the victorious Tolomei.\r\nUnsuccessful in these endeavours, he next took the more equivocal step\r\nof seeking warlike aid from the Pisans. But Florence kept Pisa in check,\r\nand Ugo found only an inglorious refuge where he had hoped to acquire\r\nactive allies. He had been wounded in these struggles; but, animated by\r\na superhuman spirit, he had forgotten his pain and surmounted his\r\nweakness; nor was it until a cold refusal was returned to his energetic\r\nrepresentations, that he sank beneath his physical sufferings. He was\r\nstretched on a bed of torture when he received intelligence that an\r\nedict of perpetual banishment and confiscation of property was passed\r\nagainst him. His two children, beggars now, were sent to him. His wife\r\nwas dead, and these were all of near relations that he possessed. His\r\nbitter feelings were still too paramount for him to receive comfort from\r\ntheir presence; yet these agitated and burning emotions appeared in\r\nafter-times a remnant of happiness compared to the total loss of every\r\nhope\u2014the wasting inaction of sickness and of poverty.\r\n\r\nFor five years Ugo Mancini lay stretched on his couch, alternating\r\nbetween states of intense pain and overpowering weakness; and then he\r\ndied. During this interval, the wreck of his fortunes, consisting of the\r\nrent of a small farm, and the use of some money lent, scantily supported\r\nhim. His few relatives and followers were obliged to seek their\r\nsubsistence elsewhere, and he remained alone to his pain, and to his two\r\nchildren, who yet clung to the paternal side.\r\n\r\nHatred to his foes, and love for his native town, were the sentiments\r\nthat possessed his soul, and which he imparted in their full force to\r\nthe plastic mind of his son, which received like molten metal the stamp\r\nhe desired to impress. Lorenzo was scarcely twelve years old at the\r\nperiod of his father\u2019s exile, and he naturally turned with fondness\r\ntowards the spot where he had enjoyed every happiness, where each hour\r\nhad been spent in light-hearted hilarity, and the kindness and\r\nobservance of many attended on his steps. Now, how sad the contrast!\u2014dim\r\npenury\u2014a solitude cheered by no encouraging smiles or sunny\r\nflatteries\u2014perpetual attendance on his father, and untimely cares, cast\r\ntheir dark shadows over his altered lot.\r\n\r\nLorenzo was a few years older than his sister. Friendless and destitute\r\nas was the exile\u2019s family, it was he who overlooked its moderate\r\ndisbursements, who was at once his father\u2019s nurse and his sister\u2019s\r\nguardian, and acted as the head of the family during the incapacity of\r\nhis parent. But instead of being narrowed or broken in spirit by these\r\nburdens, his ardent soul rose to meet them, and grew enlarged and lofty\r\nfrom the very calls made upon it. His look was serious, not careworn;\r\nhis manner calm, not humble; his voice had all the tenderness of a\r\nwoman\u2014his eye all the pride and fire of a hero.\r\n\r\nStill his unhappy father wasted away, and Lorenzo\u2019s hours were entirely\r\nspent beside his bed. He was indefatigable in his attentions\u2014weariness\r\nnever seemed to overcome him. His limbs were always alert\u2014his speech\r\ninspiriting and kind. His only pastime was during any interval in his\r\nparent\u2019s sufferings, to listen to his eulogiums on his native town, and\r\nto the history of the wrongs which, from time immemorial, the Mancini\r\nhad endured from the Tolomei. Lorenzo, though replete with noble\r\nqualities, was still an Italian; and fervent love for his birthplace,\r\nand violent hatred towards the foes of his house, were the darling\r\npassions of his heart. Nursed in loneliness, they acquired vigour; and\r\nthe nights he spent in watching his father were varied by musing on the\r\ncareer he should hereafter follow\u2014his return to his beloved Siena, and\r\nthe vengeance he would take on his enemies.\r\n\r\nUgo often said, I die because I am an exile:\u2014at length these words were\r\nfulfilled, and the unhappy man sank beneath the ills of fortune. Lorenzo\r\nsaw his beloved father expire\u2014his father, whom he loved. He seemed to\r\ndeposit in his obscure grave all that best deserved reverence and honour\r\nin the world; and turning away his steps, he lamented the loss of the\r\nsad occupation of so many years, and regretted the exchange he made from\r\nhis father\u2019s sick bed to a lonely and unprized freedom.\r\n\r\nThe first use he made of the liberty he had thus acquired was to return\r\nto Siena with his sister. He entered his native town as if it were a\r\nparadise, and he found it a desert in all save the hues of beauty and\r\ndelight with which his imagination loved to invest it. There was no one\r\nto whom he could draw near in friendship within the whole circuit of its\r\nwalls. According to the barbarous usage of the times, his father\u2019s\r\npalace had been razed, and the mournful ruins stood as a tomb to\r\ncommemorate the fall of his fortunes. Not as such did Lorenzo view them;\r\nhe often stole out at nightfall, when the stars alone beheld his\r\nenthusiasm, and, clambering to the highest part of the massy fragments,\r\nspent long hours in mentally rebuilding the desolate walls, and in\r\nconsecrating once again the weed-grown hearth to family love and\r\nhospitable festivity. It seemed to him that the air was more balmy and\r\nlight, breathed amidst these memorials of the past; and his heart warmed\r\nwith rapture over the tale they told of what his progenitors had\r\nbeen\u2014what he again would be.\r\n\r\nYet, had he viewed his position sanely, he would have found it full of\r\nmortification and pain; and he would have become aware that his native\r\ntown was perhaps the only place in the world where his ambition would\r\nfail in the attainment of its aim. The Tolomei reigned over it. They had\r\nled its citizens to conquest, and enriched them with spoils. They were\r\nadored; and to flatter them, the populace were prone to revile and scoff\r\nat the name of Mancini. Lorenzo did not possess one friend within its\r\nwalls: he heard the murmur of hatred as he passed along, and beheld his\r\nenemies raised to the pinnacle of power and honour; and yet, so\r\nstrangely framed is the human heart, that he continued to love Siena,\r\nand would not have exchanged his obscure and penurious abode within its\r\nwalls to become the favoured follower of the German Emperor. Such a\r\nplace, through education and the natural prejudices of man, did Siena\r\nhold in his imagination, that a lowly condition there seemed a nobler\r\ndestiny than to be great in any other spot.\r\n\r\nTo win back the friendship of its citizens and humble his enemies was\r\nthe dream that shed so sweet an influence over his darkened hours. He\r\ndedicated his whole being to this work, and he did not doubt but that he\r\nshould succeed. The house of Tolomei had for its chief a youth but a\r\nyear or two older than himself\u2014with him, when an opportunity should\r\npresent itself, he would enter the lists. It seemed the bounty of\r\nProvidence that gave him one so nearly equal with whom to contend; and\r\nduring the interval that must elapse before they could clash, he was\r\nbusy in educating himself for the struggle. Count Fabian dei Tolomei\r\nbore the reputation of being a youth full of promise and talent; and\r\nLorenzo was glad to anticipate a worthy antagonist. He occupied himself\r\nin the practice of arms, and applied with perseverance to the study of\r\nthe few books that fell in his way. He appeared in the market-place on\r\npublic occasions modestly attired; yet his height, his dignified\r\ncarriage, and the thoughtful cast of his noble countenance, drew the\r\nobservation of the bystanders;\u2014though, such was the prejudice against\r\nhis name, and the flattery of the triumphant party, that taunts and\r\nmaledictions followed him. His nobility of appearance was called pride;\r\nhis affability, meanness; his aspiring views, faction;\u2014and it was\r\ndeclared that it would be a happy day when he should no longer blot\r\ntheir sunshine with his shadow. Lorenzo smiled,\u2014he disdained to resent,\r\nor even to feel, the mistaken insults of the crowd, who, if fortune\r\nchanged, would the next day throw up their caps for him. It was only\r\nwhen loftier foes approached that his brow grew dark, that he drew\r\nhimself up to his full height, repaying their scorn with glances of\r\ndefiance and hate.\r\n\r\nBut although he was ready in his own person to encounter the contumely\r\nof his townsmen, and walked on with placid mien, regardless of their\r\nsneers, he carefully guarded his sister from such scenes. She was led by\r\nhim each morning, closely veiled, to hear mass in an obscure church. And\r\nwhen, on feast-days, the public walks were crowded with cavaliers and\r\ndames in splendid attire, and with citizens and peasants in their\r\nholiday garb, this gentle pair might be seen in some solitary and shady\r\nspot, Flora knew none to love except her brother\u2014she had grown under his\r\neyes from infancy; and while he attended on the sick-bed of their\r\nfather, he was father, brother, tutor, guardian to her\u2014the fondest\r\nmother could not have been more indulgent; and yet there was mingled a\r\nsomething beyond, pertaining to their difference of sex. Uniformly\r\nobservant and kind, he treated her as if she had been a high-born\r\ndamsel, nurtured in her gayest bower.\r\n\r\nHer attire was simple\u2014but thus, she was instructed, it befitted every\r\ndamsel to dress; her needle-works were such as a princess might have\r\nemulated; and while she learnt under her brother\u2019s tutelage to be\r\nreserved, studious of obscurity, and always occupied, she was taught\r\nthat such were the virtues becoming her sex, and no idea of dependence\r\nor penury was raised in her mind. Had he been the sole human being that\r\napproached her, she might have believed herself to be on a level with\r\nthe highest in the land; but coming in contact with dependants in the\r\nhumble class of life, Flora became acquainted with her true position;\r\nand learnt, at the same time, to understand and appreciate the\r\nunequalled kindness and virtues of her brother.\r\n\r\nTwo years passed while brother and sister continued, in obscurity and\r\npoverty, cherishing hope, honour, and mutual love. If an anxious thought\r\never crossed Lorenzo, it was for the future destiny of Flora, whose\r\nbeauty as a child gave promise of perfect loveliness hereafter. For her\r\nsake he was anxious to begin the career he had marked out for himself,\r\nand resolved no longer to delay his endeavours to revive his party in\r\nSiena, and to seek rather than avoid a contest with the young Count\r\nFabian, on whose overthrow he would rise\u2014Count Fabian, the darling of\r\nthe citizens, vaunted as a model for a youthful cavalier, abounding in\r\ngood qualities, and so adorned by gallantry, subtle wit, and gay,\r\nwinning manners, that he stepped by right of nature, as well as birth,\r\non the pedestal which exalted him the idol of all around.\r\n\r\nIt was on a day of public feasting that Lorenzo first presented himself\r\nin rivalship with Fabian. His person was unknown to the count, who, in\r\nall the pride of rich dress and splendid accoutrements, looked with a\r\nsmile of patronage on the poorly-mounted and plainly-attired youth, who\r\npresented himself to run a tilt with him. But before the challenge was\r\naccepted, the name of his antagonist was whispered to Fabian; then, all\r\nthe bitterness engendered by family feuds; all the spirit of vengeance,\r\nwhich had been taught as a religion, arose at once in the young noble\u2019s\r\nheart; he wheeled round his steed, and, riding rudely up to his\r\ncompetitor, ordered him instantly to retire from the course, nor dare to\r\ndisturb the revels of the citizens by the hated presence of a Mancini.\r\nLorenzo answered with equal scorn; and Fabian, governed by\r\nuncontrollable passion, called together his followers to drive the youth\r\nwith ignominy from the lists. A fearful array was mustered against the\r\nhateful intruder; but had their number been trebled, the towering spirit\r\nof Lorenzo had met them all. One fell\u2014another was disabled by his weapon\r\nbefore he was disarmed and made prisoner; but his bravery did not avail\r\nto extract admiration from his prejudiced foes: they rather poured\r\nexecrations on him for its disastrous effects, as they hurried him to a\r\ndungeon, and called loudly for his punishment and death.\r\n\r\nFar from this scene of turmoil and bloodshed, in her poor but quiet\r\nchamber, in a remote and obscure part of the town, sat Flora, occupied\r\nby her embroidery, musing, as she worked, on her brother\u2019s project, and\r\nanticipating his success. Hours passed, and Lorenzo did not return; the\r\nday declined, and still he tarried. Flora\u2019s busy fancy forged a thousand\r\ncauses for the delay. Her brother\u2019s prowess had awaked the chilly zeal\r\nof the partisans of their family;\u2014he was doubtless feasting among them,\r\nand the first stone was laid for the rebuilding of their house. At last,\r\na rush of steps upon the staircase, and a confused clamour of female\r\nvoices calling loudly for admittance, made her rise and open the\r\ndoor;\u2014in rushed several women\u2014dismay was painted on their faces\u2014their\r\nwords flowed in torrents\u2014their eager gestures helped them to a meaning,\r\nand, though not without difficulty, amidst the confusion, Flora heard of\r\nthe disaster and imprisonment of her brother\u2014of the blood shed by his\r\nhand, and the fatal issue that such a deed ensured. She grew pale as\r\nmarble. Her young heart was filled with speechless terror; she could\r\nform no image of the thing she dreaded, but its indistinct idea was full\r\nof fear. Lorenzo was in prison\u2014Count Fabian had placed him there\u2014he was\r\nto die! Overwhelmed for a moment by such tidings, yet she rose above\r\ntheir benumbing power, and without proffering a word, or listening to\r\nthe questions and remonstrances of the women, she rushed past them, down\r\nthe high staircase, into the street; and then with swift pace to where\r\nthe public prison was situated. She knew the spot she wished to reach,\r\nbut she had so seldom quitted her home that she soon got entangled among\r\nthe streets, and proceeded onwards at random. Breathless, at length, she\r\npaused before the lofty portal of a large palace\u2014no one was near\u2014the\r\nfast fading twilight of an Italian evening had deepened into absolute\r\ndarkness. At this moment the glare of flambeaux was thrown upon the\r\nstreet, and a party of horsemen rode up; they were talking and laughing\r\ngaily. She heard one addressed as Count Fabian: she involuntarily drew\r\nback with instinctive hate; and then rushed forward and threw herself at\r\nhis horse\u2019s feet, exclaiming, \u201cSave my brother!\u201d The young cavalier\r\nreined up shortly his prancing steed, angrily reproving her for her\r\nheedlessness, and, without deigning another word, entered the courtyard.\r\nHe had not, perhaps, heard her prayer;\u2014he could not see the suppliant,\r\nhe spoke but in the impatience of the moment;\u2014but the poor child, deeply\r\nwounded by what had the appearance of a personal insult, turned proudly\r\nfrom the door, repressing the bitter tears that filled her eyes. Still\r\nshe walked on; but night took from her every chance of finding her way\r\nto the prison, and she resolved to return home, to engage one of the\r\nwomen of the house, of which she occupied a part, to accompany her. But\r\neven to find her way back became matter of difficulty; and she wandered\r\non, discovering no clue to guide her, and far too timid to address any\r\none she might chance to meet. Fatigue and personal fear were added to\r\nher other griefs, and tears streamed plentifully down her cheeks as she\r\ncontinued her hopeless journey! At length, at the corner of a street,\r\nshe recognised an image of the Madonna in a niche, with a lamp burning\r\nover it, familiar to her recollection as being near her home. With\r\ncharacteristic piety she knelt before it in thankfulness, and was\r\noffering a prayer for Lorenzo, when the sound of steps made her start\r\nup, and her brother\u2019s voice hailed, and her brother\u2019s arms encircled\r\nher; it seemed a miracle, but he was there, and all her fears were\r\nended.\r\n\r\nLorenzo anxiously asked whither she had been straying; her explanation\r\nwas soon given; and he in return related the misfortunes of the\r\nmorning\u2014the fate that impended over him, averted by the generous\r\nintercession of young Fabian himself; and yet\u2014he hesitated to unfold the\r\nbitter truth\u2014he was not freely pardoned\u2014he stood there a banished man,\r\ncondemned to die if the morrow\u2019s sun found him within the walls of\r\nSiena.\r\n\r\nThey had arrived, meanwhile, at their home; and with feminine care Flora\r\nplaced a simple repast before her brother, and then employed herself\r\nbusily in making various packages. Lorenzo paced the room, absorbed in\r\nthought; at length he stopped, and, kissing the fair girl, said,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere can I place thee in safety? how preserve thee, my flower of\r\nbeauty, while we are divided?\u201d\r\n\r\nFlora looked up fearfully. \u201cDo I not go with you?\u201d she asked; \u201cI was\r\nmaking preparations for our journey.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cImpossible, dearest; I go to privation and hardship.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I would share them with thee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may not be, sweet sister,\u201d replied Lorenzo, \u201cfate divides us, and we\r\nmust submit. I go to camps\u2014to the society of rude men; to struggle with\r\nsuch fortune as cannot harm me, but which for thee would be fraught with\r\nperil and despair. No, my Flora, I must provide safe and honourable\r\nguardianship for thee, even in this town.\u201d And again Lorenzo meditated\r\ndeeply on the part he should take, till suddenly a thought flashed on\r\nhis mind. \u201cIt is hazardous,\u201d he murmured, \u201cand yet I do him wrong to\r\ncall it so. Were our fates reversed, should I not think myself highly\r\nhonoured by such a trust?\u201d And then he told his sister to don hastily\r\nher best attire; to wrap her veil round her, and to come with him. She\r\nobeyed\u2014for obedience to her brother was the first and dearest of her\r\nduties. But she wept bitterly while her trembling fingers braided her\r\nlong hair, and she hastily changed her dress.\r\n\r\nAt length they walked forth again, and proceeded slowly, as Lorenzo\r\nemployed the precious minutes in consoling and counselling his sister.\r\nHe promised as speedy a return as he could accomplish; but if he failed\r\nto appear as soon as he could wish, yet he vowed solemnly that, if alive\r\nand free, she should see him within five years from the moment of\r\nparting. Should he not come before, he besought her earnestly to take\r\npatience, and to hope for the best till the expiration of that period;\r\nand made her promise not to bind herself by any vestal or matrimonial\r\nvow in the interim. They had arrived at their destination, and entered\r\nthe courtyard of a spacious palace. They met no servants; so crossed the\r\ncourt, and ascended the ample stairs. Flora had endeavoured to listen to\r\nher brother. He had bade her be of good cheer, and he was about to leave\r\nher; he told her to hope; and he spoke of an absence to endure five\r\nyears\u2014an endless term to her youthful anticipations. She promised\r\nobedience, but her voice was choked by sobs, and her tottering limbs\r\nwould not have supported her without his aid. She now perceived that\r\nthey were entering the lighted and inhabited rooms of a noble dwelling,\r\nand tried to restrain her tears, as she drew her veil closely around\r\nher. They passed from room to room, in which preparations for festivity\r\nwere making; the servants ushered them on, as if they had been invited\r\nguests, and conducted them into a hall filled with all the nobility and\r\nbeauty of Siena. Each eye turned with curiosity and wonder on the pair.\r\nLorenzo\u2019s tall person, and the lofty expression of his handsome\r\ncountenance, put the ladies in good-humour with him, while the cavaliers\r\ntried to peep under Flora\u2019s veil.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a mere child,\u201d they said, \u201cand a sorrowing one\u2014what can this\r\nmean?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe youthful master of the house, however, instantly recognised his\r\nuninvited and unexpected guest; but before he could ask the meaning of\r\nhis coming, Lorenzo had advanced with his sister to the spot where he\r\nstood, and addressed him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never thought, Count Fabian, to stand beneath your roof, and much\r\nless to approach you as a suitor. But that Supreme Power, to whose\r\ndecrees we must all bend, has reduced me to such adversity as, if it be\r\nHis will, may also visit you, notwithstanding the many friends that now\r\nsurround you, and the sunshine of prosperity in which you bask. I stand\r\nhere a banished man and a beggar. Nor do I repine at this my fate. Most\r\nwilling am I that my right arm alone should create my fortunes; and,\r\nwith the blessing of God, I hope so to direct my course, that we may yet\r\nmeet upon more equal terms. In this hope I turn my steps, not\r\nunwillingly, from this city; dear as its name is to my heart\u2014and dear\r\nthe associations which link its proud towers with the memory of my\r\nforefathers. I leave it a soldier of fortune; how I may return is\r\nwritten in the page where your unread destiny is traced as well as mine.\r\nBut my care ends not with myself. My dying father bequeathed to me this\r\nchild, my orphan sister, whom I have, until now, watched over with a\r\nparent\u2019s love. I should ill perform the part intrusted to me, were I to\r\ndrag this tender blossom from its native bower into the rude highways of\r\nlife. Lord Fabian, I can count no man my friend; for it would seem that\r\nyour smiles have won the hearts of my fellow-citizens from me; and death\r\nand exile have so dealt with my house, that not one of my name exists\r\nwithin the walls of Siena. To you alone can I intrust this precious\r\ncharge. Will you accept it until called upon to render it back to me,\r\nher brother, or to the juster hands of our Creator, pure and untarnished\r\nas I now deliver her to you? I ask you to protect her helplessness, to\r\nguard her honour; will you\u2014dare you accept a treasure, with the\r\nassurance of restoring it unsoiled, unhurt?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe deep expressive voice of the noble youth and his earnest eloquence\r\nenchained the ears of the whole assembly; and when he ceased, Fabian,\r\nproud of the appeal, and nothing loath in the buoyant spirit of youth to\r\nundertake a charge which, thus proffered before his assembled kinsmen\r\nand friends, became an honour, answered readily, \u201cI agree, and solemnly\r\nbefore Heaven accept your offer. I declare myself the guardian and\r\nprotector of your sister; she shall dwell in safety beneath my kind\r\nmother\u2019s care, and if the saints permit your return, she shall be\r\ndelivered back to you as spotless as she now is.\u201d\r\n\r\nLorenzo bowed his head; something choked his utterance as he thought\r\nthat he was about to part for ever from Flora; but he disdained to\r\nbetray this weakness before his enemies. He took his sister\u2019s hand and\r\ngazed upon her slight form with a look of earnest fondness, then\r\nmurmuring a blessing over her, and kissing her brow, he again saluted\r\nCount Fabian, and turning away with measured steps and lofty mien, left\r\nthe hall. Flora, scarcely understanding what had passed, stood trembling\r\nand weeping under her veil. She yielded her passive hand to Fabian, who,\r\nleading her to his mother, said: \u201cMadam, I ask of your goodness, and the\r\nmaternal indulgence you have ever shown, to assist me in fulfilling my\r\npromise, by taking under your gracious charge this young orphan.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou command here, my son,\u201d said the countess, \u201cand your will shall be\r\nobeyed.\u201d Then making a sign to one of her attendants, Flora was\r\nconducted from the hall, to where, in solitude and silence, she wept\r\nover her brother\u2019s departure, and her own strange position.\r\n\r\nFlora thus became an inmate of the dwelling of her ancestral foes, and\r\nthe ward of the most bitter enemy of her house. Lorenzo was gone she\r\nknew not whither, and her only pleasure consisted in reflecting that she\r\nwas obeying his behests. Her life was uniform and tranquil. Her\r\noccupation was working tapestry, in which she displayed taste and skill.\r\nSometimes she had the more mortifying task imposed on her of waiting on\r\nthe Countess de\u2019 Tolomei, who having lost two brothers in the last\r\ncontest with the Mancini, nourished a deep hatred towards the whole\r\nrace, and never smiled on the luckless orphan. Flora submitted to every\r\ncommand imposed upon her. She was buoyed up by the reflection that her\r\nsufferings wore imposed on her by Lorenzo; schooling herself in any\r\nmoment of impatience by the idea that thus she shared his adversity. No\r\nmurmur escaped her, though the pride and independence of her nature were\r\noften cruelly offended by the taunts and supercilious airs of her\r\npatroness or mistress, who was not a bad woman, but who thought it\r\nvirtue to ill-treat a Mancini. Often, indeed, she neither heard nor\r\nheeded these things. Her thoughts were far away, and grief for the loss\r\nof her brother\u2019s society weighed too heavily on her to allow her to\r\nspend more than a passing sigh on her personal injuries.\r\n\r\nThe countess was unkind and disdainful, but it was not thus with Flora\u2019s\r\ncompanions. They were amiable and affectionate girls, either of the\r\nbourgeois class, or daughters of dependants of the house of Tolomei. The\r\nlength of time which had elapsed since the overthrow of the Mancini, had\r\nerased from their young minds the bitter duty of hatred, and it was\r\nimpossible for them to live on terms of daily intercourse with the\r\norphan daughter of this ill-fated race, and not to become strongly\r\nattached to her. She was wholly devoid of selfishness, and content to\r\nperform her daily tasks in inoffensive silence. She had no envy, no wish\r\nto shine, no desire of pleasure. She was nevertheless ever ready to\r\nsympathize with her companions, and glad to have it in her power to\r\nadminister to their happiness. To help them in the manufacture of some\r\npiece of finery; to assist them in their work; and, perfectly prudent\r\nand reserved herself, to listen to all their sentimental adventures; to\r\ngive her best advice, and to aid them in any difficulty, were the simple\r\nmeans she used to win their unsophisticated hearts. They called her an\r\nangel; they looked up to her as to a saint, and in their hearts\r\nrespected her more than the countess herself.\r\n\r\nOne only subject ever disturbed Flora\u2019s serene melancholy. The praise\r\nshe perpetually heard lavished on Count Fabian, her brother\u2019s too\r\nsuccessful rival and oppressor, was an unendurable addition to her other\r\ngriefs. Content with her own obscurity, her ambition, her pride, her\r\naspiring thoughts were spent upon her brother. She hated Count Fabian as\r\nLorenzo\u2019s destroyer, and the cause of his unhappy exile. His\r\naccomplishments she despised as painted vanities; his person she\r\ncontemned as the opposite of his prototype. His blue eyes, clear and\r\nopen as day; his fair complexion and light brown hair; his slight\r\nelegant person; his voice, whose tones in song won each listener\u2019s heart\r\nto tenderness and love; his wit, his perpetual flow of spirits, and\r\nunalterable good-humour, were impertinences and frivolities to her who\r\ncherished with such dear worship the recollection of her serious,\r\nardent, noble-hearted brother, whose soul was ever set on high thoughts,\r\nand devoted to acts of virtue and self-sacrifice; whose fortitude and\r\naffectionate courtesy seemed to her the crown and glory of manhood; how\r\ndifferent from the trifling flippancy of Fabian! \u201cName an eagle,\u201d she\r\nwould say, \u201cand we raise our eyes to heaven, there to behold a creature\r\nfashioned in Nature\u2019s bounty; but it is a degradation to waste one\r\nthought on the insect of a day.\u201d Some speech similar to this had been\r\nkindly reported to the young count\u2019s lady mother, who idolized her son\r\nas the ornament and delight of his age and country. She severely\r\nreprimanded the incautious Flora, who, for the first time, listened\r\nproudly and unyieldingly. From this period her situation grew more\r\nirksome; all she could do was to endeavour to withdraw herself entirely\r\nfrom observation, and to brood over the perfections, while she lamented\r\nyet more keenly the absence, of her brother.\r\n\r\nTwo or three years thus flew away, and Flora grew from a\r\nchildish-looking girl of twelve into the bewitching beauty of fifteen.\r\nShe unclosed like a flower, whose fairest petals are yet shut, but whose\r\nhalf-veiled loveliness is yet more attractive. It was at this time that\r\non occasion of doing honour to a prince of France, who was passing on to\r\nNaples, the Countess Tolomei and her son, with a bevy of friends and\r\nfollowers, went out to meet and to escort the royal traveller on his\r\nway. Assembled in the hall of the palace, and waiting for the arrival of\r\nsome of their number, Count Fabian went round his mother\u2019s circle,\r\nsaying agreeable and merry things to all. Wherever his cheerful blue\r\neyes lighted, there smiles were awakened and each young heart beat with\r\nvanity at his harmless flatteries. After a gallant speech or two, he\r\nespied Flora, retired behind her companions.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat flower is this,\u201d he said, \u201cplaying at hide and seek with her\r\nbeauty?\u201d And then, struck by the modest sweetness of her aspect, her\r\neyes cast down, and a rosy blush mantling over her cheek, he added,\r\n\u201cWhat fair angel makes one of your company?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn angel indeed, my lord,\u201d exclaimed one of the younger girls, who\r\ndearly loved her best friend; \u201cshe is Flora Mancini.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMancini!\u201d exclaimed Fabian, while his manner became at once respectful\r\nand kind. \u201cAre you the orphan daughter of Ugo\u2014the sister of Lorenzo,\r\ncommitted by him to my care?\u201d For since then, through her careful\r\navoidance, Fabian had never even seen his fair ward. She bowed an assent\r\nto his questions, while her swelling heart denied her speech; and\r\nFabian, going up to his mother, said, \u201cMadam, I hope for our honour\u2019s\r\nsake that this has not before happened. The adverse fortune of this\r\nyoung lady may render retirement and obscurity befitting; but it is not\r\nfor us to turn into a menial one sprung from the best blood in Italy.\r\nLet me entreat you not to permit this to occur again. How shall I redeem\r\nmy pledged honour, or answer to her brother for this unworthy\r\ndegradation?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you have me make a friend and a companion of a Mancini?\u201d asked\r\nthe countess, with raised colour.\r\n\r\n\u201cI ask you not, mother, to do aught displeasing to you,\u201d replied the\r\nyoung noble; \u201cbut Flora is my ward, not our servant;\u2014permit her to\r\nretire; she will probably prefer the privacy of home, to making one\r\namong the festive crowd of her house\u2019s enemies. If not, let the choice\r\nbe hers\u2014Say, gentle one, will you go with us or retire?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe did not speak, but raising her soft eyes, curtsied to him and to his\r\nmother, and quitted the room; so, tacitly making her selection.\r\n\r\nFrom this time Flora never quitted the more secluded apartments of the\r\npalace, nor again saw Fabian. She was unaware that he had been profuse\r\nin his eulogium on her beauty; but that while frequently expressing his\r\ninterest in his ward, he rather avoided the dangerous power of her\r\nloveliness. She led rather a prison life, walking only in the palace\r\ngarden when it was else deserted, but otherwise her time was at her own\r\ndisposal, and no commands now interfered with her freedom. Her labours\r\nwere all spontaneous. The countess seldom even saw her, and she lived\r\namong this lady\u2019s attendants like a free boarder in a convent; who\r\ncannot quit the walls, but who is not subservient to the rules of the\r\nasylum. She was more busy than ever at her tapestry frame, because the\r\ncountess prized her work; and thus she could in some degree repay the\r\nprotection afforded her. She never mentioned Fabian, and always imposed\r\nsilence on her companions when they spoke of him. But she did this in no\r\ndisrespectful terms. \u201cHe is a generous enemy, I acknowledge,\u201d she would\r\nsay, \u201cbut still he is my enemy, and while through him my brother is an\r\nexile and a wanderer upon earth, it is painful to me to hear his name.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of many months spent in entire seclusion and\r\ntranquillity, a change occurred in the tenor of her life. The countess\r\nsuddenly resolved to pass the Easter festival at Rome. Flora\u2019s\r\ncompanions were wild with joy at the prospect of the journey, the\r\nnovelty, and the entertainment they promised themselves from this visit,\r\nand pitied the dignity of their friend, which prevented her from making\r\none in their mistress\u2019s train; for it was soon understood that Flora was\r\nto be left behind; and she was informed that the interval of the lady\u2019s\r\nabsence was to be passed by her in a villa belonging to the family\r\nsituated in a sequestered nook among the neighbouring Apennines.\r\n\r\nThe countess departed in pomp and pride on her so-called pilgrimage to\r\nthe sacred city, and at the same time Flora was conveyed to her rural\r\nretreat. The villa was inhabited only by the peasant and his family, who\r\ncultivated the farm, or podere, attached to it, and the old cassi\u00e9re or\r\nhousekeeper. The cheerfulness and freedom of the country were\r\ndelightful, and the entire solitude consonant to the habits of the\r\nmeditative girl, accustomed to the confinement of the city, and the\r\nintrusive prattle of her associates. Spring was opening with all the\r\nbeauty which that season showers upon favoured Italy. The almond and\r\npeach trees were in blossom; and the vine-dresser sang at his work,\r\nperched with his pruning-knife among the vines. Blossoms and flowers, in\r\nlaughing plenty, graced the soil; and the trees, swelling with buds\r\nready to expand into leaves, seemed to feel the life that animated their\r\ndark old boughs. Flora was enchanted; the country labours interested\r\nher, and the hoarded experience of old Sandra was a treasure-house of\r\nwisdom and amusement. Her attention had hitherto been directed to giving\r\nthe most vivid hues and truest imitation to her transcript with her\r\nneedle of some picture given her as a model; but here was a novel\r\noccupation. She learned the history of the bees, watched the habits of\r\nthe birds, and inquired into the culture of plants. Sandra was delighted\r\nwith her new companion; and, though notorious for being cross, yet could\r\nwriggle her antique lips into smiles for Flora.\r\n\r\nTo repay the kindness of her guardian and his mother, she still devoted\r\nmuch time to her needle. This occupation but engaged half her attention;\r\nand while she pursued it, she could give herself up to endless reverie\r\non the subject of Lorenzo\u2019s fortunes. Three years had flown since he had\r\nleft her; and, except a little gold cross brought to her by a pilgrim\r\nfrom Milan, but one month after his departure, she had received no\r\ntidings of him. Whether from Milan he had proceeded to France, Germany,\r\nor the Holy Land, she did not know. By turns her fancy led him to either\r\nof these places, and fashioned the course of events that might have\r\nbefallen him. She figured to herself his toilsome journeys\u2014his life in\r\nthe camp\u2014his achievements, and the honours showered on him by kings and\r\nnobles; her cheek glowed at the praises he received, and her eye kindled\r\nwith delight as it imaged him standing with modest pride and an erect\r\nbut gentle mien before them. Then the fair enthusiast paused; it crossed\r\nher recollection like a shadow, that if all had gone prosperously, he\r\nhad returned to share his prosperity with her, and her faltering heart\r\nturned to sadder scenes to account for his protracted absence.\r\n\r\nSometimes, while thus employed, she brought her work into the trellised\r\narbour of the garden, or, when it was too warm for the open air, she had\r\na favourite shady window, which looked down a deep ravine into a\r\nmajestic wood, whence the sound of falling water met her ears. One day,\r\nwhile she employed her fingers upon the spirited likeness of a hound\r\nwhich made a part of the hunting-piece she was working for the countess,\r\na sharp, wailing cry suddenly broke on her ear, followed by trampling of\r\nhorses and the hurried steps and loud vociferations of men. They entered\r\nthe villa on the opposite side from that which her window commanded;\r\nbut, the noise continuing, she rose to ask the reason, when Sandra burst\r\ninto the room, crying, \u201cO Madonna! he is dead! he has been thrown from\r\nhis horse, and he will never speak more.\u201d Flora for an instant could\r\nonly think of her brother. She rushed past the old woman, down into the\r\ngreat hall, in which, lying on a rude litter of boughs, she beheld the\r\ninanimate body of Count Fabian. He was surrounded by servitors and\r\npeasants, who were all clasping their hands and tearing their hair as,\r\nwith frightful shrieks, they pressed round their lord, not one of them\r\nendeavouring to restore him to life. Flora\u2019s first impulse was to\r\nretire; but, casting a second glance on the livid brow of the young\r\ncount, she saw his eyelids move, and the blood falling in quick drops\r\nfrom his hair on the pavement. She exclaimed, \u201cHe is not dead\u2014he bleeds!\r\nhasten some of you for a leech!\u201d And meanwhile she hurried to get some\r\nwater, sprinkled it on his face, and, dispersing the group that hung\r\nover him and impeded the free air, the soft breeze playing on his\r\nforehead revived him, and he gave manifest tokens of life; so that when\r\nthe physician arrived, he found that, though he was seriously and even\r\ndangerously hurt, every hope might be entertained of his recovery.\r\n\r\nFlora undertook the office of his nurse, and fulfilled its duties with\r\nunwearied attention. She watched him by night and waited on him by day\r\nwith that spirit of Christian humility and benevolence which animates a\r\nSister of Charity as she tends the sick. For several days Fabian\u2019s soul\r\nseemed on the wing to quit its earthly abode; and the state of weakness\r\nthat followed his insensibility was scarcely less alarming. At length,\r\nhe recognised and acknowledged the care of Flora, but she alone\r\npossessed any power to calm and guide him during the state of\r\nirritability and fever that then ensued. Nothing except her presence\r\ncontrolled his impatience; before her he was so lamb-like, that she\r\ncould scarcely have credited the accounts that others gave her of his\r\nviolence, but that, whenever she returned, after leaving him for any\r\ntime, she heard his voice far off in anger, and found him with flushed\r\ncheeks and flashing eyes, all which demonstrations subsided into meek\r\nacquiescence when she drew near.\r\n\r\nIn a few weeks he was able to quit his room; but any noise or sudden\r\nsound drove him almost insane. So loud is an Italian\u2019s quietest\r\nmovements, that Flora was obliged to prevent the approach of any except\r\nherself; and her soft voice and noiseless footfall were the sweetest\r\nmedicine she could administer to her patient. It was painful to her to\r\nbe in perpetual attendance on Lorenzo\u2019s rival and foe, but she subdued\r\nher heart to her duty, and custom helped to reconcile her. As he grew\r\nbetter, she could not help remarking the intelligence of his\r\ncountenance, and the kindness and cordiality of his manners. There was\r\nan unobtrusive and delicate attention and care in his intercourse with\r\nher that won her to be pleased. When he conversed, his discourse was\r\nfull of entertainment and variety. His memory was well-stored with\r\nnumerous _fabliaux_, _novelle_, and romances, which he quickly\r\ndiscovered to be highly interesting to her, and so contrived to have one\r\nalways ready from the exhaustless stock he possessed. These romantic\r\nstories reminded her of the imaginary adventures she had invented, in\r\nsolitude and silence, for her brother; and each tale of foreign\r\ncountries had a peculiar charm, which animated her face as she listened,\r\nso that Fabian could have gone on for ever, only to mark the varying\r\nexpression of her countenance as he proceeded. Yet she acknowledged\r\nthese attractions in him as a Catholic nun may the specious virtues of a\r\nheretic; and, while he contrived each day to increase the pleasure she\r\nderived from his society, she satisfied her conscience with regard to\r\nher brother by cherishing in secret a little quiet stock of family hate,\r\nand by throwing over her manners, whenever she could recollect so to do,\r\na cold and ceremonious tone, which she had the pleasure of seeing vexed\r\nhim heartily.\r\n\r\nNearly two months had passed, and he was so well recovered that Flora\r\nbegan to wonder that he did not return to Siena, and of course to fulfil\r\nher duty by wishing that he should; and yet, while his cheek was sunk\r\nthrough past sickness, and his elastic step grown slow, she, as a nurse\r\ndesirous of completing her good work, felt averse to his entering too\r\nsoon on the scene of the busy town and its noisy pleasures. At length,\r\ntwo or three of his friends having come to see him, he agreed to return\r\nwith them to the city. A significant glance which they cast on his young\r\nnurse probably determined him. He parted from her with a grave courtesy\r\nand a profusion of thanks, unlike his usual manner, and rode off without\r\nalluding to any probability of their meeting again.\r\n\r\nShe fancied that she was relieved from a burden when he went, and was\r\nsurprised to find the days grow tedious, and mortified to perceive that\r\nher thoughts no longer spent themselves so spontaneously on her brother,\r\nand to feel that the occupation of a few weeks could unhinge her mind\r\nand dissipate her cherished reveries; thus, while she felt the absence\r\nof Fabian, she was annoyed at him the more for having, in addition to\r\nhis other misdeeds, invaded the sanctuary of her dearest thoughts. She\r\nwas beginning to conquer this listlessness, and to return with renewed\r\nzest to her usual occupations, when, in about a week after his\r\ndeparture, Fabian suddenly returned. He came upon her as she was\r\ngathering flowers for the shrine of the Madonna; and, on seeing him, she\r\nblushed as rosy red as the roses she held. He looked infinitely worse in\r\nhealth than when he went. His wan cheeks and sunk eyes excited her\r\nconcern; and her earnest and kind questions somewhat revived him. He\r\nkissed her hand, and continued to stand beside her as she finished her\r\nnosegay. Had any one seen the glad, fond look with which he regarded her\r\nas she busied herself among the flowers, even old Sandra might have\r\nprognosticated his entire recovery under her care.\r\n\r\nFlora was totally unaware of the feelings that were excited in Fabian\u2019s\r\nheart, and the struggle he made to overcome a passion too sweet and too\r\nseductive, when awakened by so lovely a being, ever to be subdued. He\r\nhad been struck with her some time ago, and avoided her. It was through\r\nhis suggestion that she passed the period of the countess\u2019s pilgrimage\r\nin this secluded villa. Nor had he thought of visiting her there; but,\r\nriding over one day to inquire concerning a foal rearing for him, his\r\nhorse had thrown him, and caused him that injury which had made him so\r\nlong the inmate of the same abode. Already prepared to admire her\u2014her\r\nkindness, her gentleness, and her unwearied patience during his illness,\r\neasily conquered a heart most ready and yet most unwilling to yield. He\r\nhad returned to Siena resolved to forget her, but he came back assured\r\nthat his life and death were in her hands.\r\n\r\nAt first Count Fabian had forgot that he had any but his own feelings\r\nand prejudices, and those of his mother and kindred, to overcome; but\r\nwhen the tyranny of love vanquished these, he began to fear a more\r\ninsurmountable impediment in Flora. The first whisper of love fell like\r\nmortal sin upon her ear; and disturbed, and even angry, she replied:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMethinks you wholly forget who I am, and what you are. I speak not of\r\nancient feuds, though these were enough to divide us for ever. Know that\r\nI hate you as my brother\u2019s oppressor. Restore Lorenzo to me\u2014recall him\r\nfrom banishment\u2014erase the memory of all that he has suffered through\r\nyou\u2014win his love and approbation;\u2014and when all this is fulfilled, which\r\nnever can be, speak a language which now it is as the bitterness of\r\ndeath for me to hear!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd saying this, she hastily retired, to conceal the floods of tears\r\nwhich this, as she termed it, insult had caused to flow; to lament yet\r\nmore deeply her brother\u2019s absence and her own dependence.\r\n\r\nFabian was not so easily silenced; and Flora had no wish to renew scenes\r\nand expressions of violence so foreign to her nature. She imposed a rule\r\non herself, by never swerving from which she hoped to destroy the\r\nill-omened love of her protector. She secluded herself as much as\r\npossible; and when with him assumed a chilling indifference of manner,\r\nand made apparent in her silence so absolute and cold a rejection of all\r\nhis persuasions, that had not love with its unvanquishable hopes reigned\r\nabsolutely in young Fabian\u2019s heart, he must have despaired. He ceased to\r\nspeak of his affection, so to win back her ancient kindness. This was at\r\nfirst difficult; for she was timid as a young bird, whose feet have\r\ntouched the limed twigs. But naturally credulous, and quite\r\ninexperienced, she soon began to believe that her alarm was exaggerated,\r\nand to resume those habits of intimacy which had heretofore subsisted\r\nbetween them. By degrees Fabian contrived to insinuate the existence of\r\nhis attachment\u2014he could not help it. He asked no return; he would wait\r\nfor Lorenzo\u2019s arrival, which he was sure could not be far distant. Her\r\ndispleasure could not change, nor silence destroy, a sentiment which\r\nsurvived in spite of both. Intrenched in her coldness and her\r\nindifference, she hoped to weary him out by her defensive warfare, and\r\nfancied that he would soon cease his pursuit in disgust.\r\n\r\nThe countess had been long away; she had proceeded to view the feast of\r\nSan Gennaro at Naples, and had not received tidings of her son\u2019s\r\nillness. Her return was now expected; and Fabian resolved to return to\r\nSiena in time to receive her. Both he and Flora were therefore surprised\r\none day, when she suddenly entered the apartment where they both were.\r\nFlora had long peremptorily insisted that he should not intrude while\r\nshe was employed on her embroidery frame; but this day he had made so\r\ngood a pretext, that for the first time he was admitted, and then\r\nsuffered to stay a few minutes\u2014they now neither of them knew how long;\r\nshe was busy at her work; and he sitting near, gazing unreproved on her\r\nunconscious face and graceful figure, felt himself happier than he had\r\never been before.\r\n\r\nThe countess was sufficiently surprised, and not a little angry; but\r\nbefore she could do more than utter one exclamation, Fabian interrupted,\r\nby entreating her not to spoil all. He drew her away; he made his own\r\nexplanations, and urged his wishes with resistless persuasion. The\r\ncountess had been used to indulge him in every wish; it was impossible\r\nfor her to deny any strongly urged request; his pertinacity, his\r\nagitation, his entreaties half won her; and the account of his illness,\r\nand his assurances, seconded by those of all the family, that Flora had\r\nsaved his life, completed the conquest, and she became in her turn a\r\nsuitor for her son to the orphan daughter of Mancini.\r\n\r\nFlora, educated till the age of twelve by one who never consulted his\r\nown pleasures and gratifications, but went right on in the path of duty,\r\nregardless of pain or disappointment, had no idea of doing aught merely\r\nbecause she or others might wish it. Since that time she had been thrown\r\non her own resources; and jealously cherishing her individuality, every\r\nfeeling of her heart had been strengthened by solitude and by a sense of\r\nmental independence. She was the least likely of any one to go with the\r\nstream, or to yield to the mere influence of circumstances. She felt,\r\nshe knew, what it became her to do, and that must be done in spite of\r\nevery argument.\r\n\r\nThe countess\u2019s expostulations and entreaties were of no avail. The\r\npromise she had made to her brother of engaging herself by no vow for\r\nfive years must be observed under every event; it was asked from her at\r\nthe sad and solemn hour of their parting, and was thus rendered doubly\r\nsacred. So constituted, indeed, were her feelings, that the slightest\r\nwish she ever remembered having been expressed by Lorenzo had more\r\nweight with her than the most urgent prayers of another. He was a part\r\nof her religion; reverence and love for him had been moulded into the\r\nsubstance of her soul from infancy; their very separation had tended to\r\nrender these impressions irradicable. She brooded over them for years;\r\nand when no sympathy or generous kindness was afforded her\u2014when the\r\ncountess treated her like an inferior and a dependant, and Fabian had\r\nforgotten her existence, she had lived from month to month, and from\r\nyear to year, cherishing the image of her brother, and only able to\r\ntolerate the annoyances that beset her existence, by considering that\r\nher patience, her fortitude, and her obedience were all offerings at the\r\nshrine of her beloved Lorenzo\u2019s desires.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the generous and kindly disposition of Fabian won her to\r\nregard him with a feeling nearly approaching tenderness, though this\r\nemotion was feeble, the mere ripple of the waves, compared to the mighty\r\ntide of affection that set her will all one way, and made her deem\r\neverything trivial except Lorenzo\u2019s return\u2014Lorenzo\u2019s existence\u2014obedience\r\nto Lorenzo. She listened to her lover\u2019s persuasions so unyieldingly that\r\nthe countess was provoked by her inflexibility; but she bore her\r\nreproaches with such mildness, and smiled so sweetly, that Fabian was\r\nthe more charmed. She admitted that she owed him a certain submission as\r\nthe guardian set over her by her brother; Fabian would have gladly\r\nexchanged this authority for the pleasure of being commanded by her; but\r\nthis was an honour he could not attain, so in playful spite he enforced\r\nconcessions from her. At his desire she appeared in society, dressed as\r\nbecame her rank, and filled in his house the station a sister of his own\r\nwould have held. She preferred seclusion, but she was averse to\r\ncontention, and it was little that she yielded, while the purpose of her\r\nsoul was as fixed as ever.\r\n\r\nThe fifth year of Lorenzo\u2019s exile was now drawing to a close, but he did\r\nnot return, nor had any intelligence been received of him. The decree of\r\nhis banishment had been repealed, the fortunes of his house restored,\r\nand his palace, under Fabian\u2019s generous care, rebuilt. These were acts\r\nthat demanded and excited Flora\u2019s gratitude; yet they were performed in\r\nan unpretending manner, as if the citizens of Siena had suddenly become\r\njust and wise without his interference. But these things dwindled into\r\ntrifles while the continuation of Lorenzo\u2019s absence seemed the pledge of\r\nher eternal misery; and the tacit appeal made to her kindness, while she\r\nhad no thought but for her brother, drove her to desperation. She could\r\nno longer tolerate the painful anomaly of her situation; she could not\r\nendure her suspense for her brother\u2019s fate, nor the reproachful glances\r\nof Fabian\u2019s mother and his friends. He himself was more generous,\u2014he\r\nread her heart, and, as the termination of the fifth year drew nigh,\r\nceased to allude to his own feelings, and appeared as wrapt as herself\r\nin doubt concerning the fate of the noble youth, whom they could\r\nscarcely entertain a hope of ever seeing more. This was small comfort to\r\nFlora. She had resolved that when the completion of the fifth year\r\nassured her that her brother was for ever lost, she would never see\r\nFabian again. At first she had resolved to take refuge in a convent, and\r\nin the sanctity of religious vows. But she remembered how averse Lorenzo\r\nhad always shown himself to this vocation, and that he had preferred to\r\nplace her beneath the roof of his foe, than within the walls of a\r\nnunnery. Besides, young as she was, and, despite of herself, full of\r\nhope, she recoiled from shutting the gates of life upon herself for\r\never. Notwithstanding her fears and sorrow, she clung to the belief that\r\nLorenzo lived; and this led her to another plan. When she had received\r\nher little cross from Milan, it was accompanied by a message that he\r\nbelieved he had found a good friend in the archbishop of that place.\r\nThis prelate, therefore, would know whither Lorenzo had first bent his\r\nsteps, and to him she resolved to apply. Her scheme was easily formed.\r\nShe possessed herself of the garb of a pilgrim, and resolved on the day\r\nfollowing the completion of the fifth year to depart from Siena, and\r\nbend her steps towards Lombardy, buoyed up by the hope that she should\r\ngain some tidings of her brother.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Fabian had formed a similar resolve. He had learnt the fact\r\nfrom Flora, of Lorenzo having first resorted to Milan, and he determined\r\nto visit that city, and not to return without certain information. He\r\nacquainted his mother with his plan, but begged her not to inform Flora,\r\nthat she might not be tortured by double doubt during his absence.\r\n\r\nThe anniversary of the fifth year was come, and with it the eve of these\r\nseveral and separate journeys. Flora had retired to spend the day at the\r\nvilla before mentioned. She had chosen to retire thither for various\r\nreasons. Her escape was more practicable thence than in the town; and\r\nshe was anxious to avoid seeing both Fabian and his mother, now that she\r\nwas on the point of inflicting severe pain on them. She spent the day at\r\nthe villa and in its gardens, musing on her plans, regretting the quiet\r\nof her past life\u2014saddened on Fabian\u2019s account\u2014grieving bitterly for\r\nLorenzo. She was not alone, for she had been obliged to confide in one\r\nof her former companions, and to obtain her assistance. Poor little\r\nAngeline was dreadfully frightened with the trust reposed in her, but\r\ndid not dare expostulate with or betray her friend; and she continued\r\nnear her during this last day, by turns trying to console and weeping\r\nwith her. Towards evening they wandered together into the wood\r\ncontiguous to the villa. Flora had taken her harp with her, but her\r\ntrembling fingers refused to strike its chords; she left it, she left\r\nher companion, and strayed on alone to take leave of a spot consecrated\r\nby many a former visit. Here the umbrageous trees gathered about her,\r\nand shaded her with their thick and drooping foliage;\u2014a torrent dashed\r\ndown from neighbouring rock, and fell from a height into a rustic basin,\r\nhollowed to receive it; then, overflowing the margin at one spot, it\r\ncontinued falling over successive declivities, till it reached the\r\nbottom of a little ravine, when it stole on in a placid and silent\r\ncourse. This had ever been a favourite resort of Flora. The twilight of\r\nthe wood and the perpetual flow, the thunder, the hurry, and the turmoil\r\nof the waters, the varied sameness of the eternal elements, accorded\r\nwith the melancholy of her ideas, and the endless succession of her\r\nreveries. She came to it now; she gazed on the limpid cascade\u2014for the\r\nlast time; a soft sadness glistened in her eyes, and her attitude\r\ndenoted the tender regret that filled her bosom; her long bright tresses\r\nstreaming in elegant disorder, her light veil and simple, yet rich,\r\nattire, were fitfully mirrored in the smooth face of the rushing waters.\r\nAt this moment the sound of steps more firm and manly than those of\r\nAngeline struck her ear, and Fabian himself stood before her; he was\r\nunable to bring himself to depart on his journey without seeing her once\r\nagain. He had ridden to the villa, and, finding that she had quitted it,\r\nsought and found her in the lone recess where they had often spent hours\r\ntogether which had been full of bliss to him. Flora was sorry to see\r\nhim, for her secret was on her lips, and yet she resolved not to give it\r\nutterance. He was ruled by the same feeling. Their interview was\r\ntherefore short, and neither alluded to what sat nearest the heart of\r\neach. They parted with a simple \u201cGood-night,\u201d as if certain of meeting\r\nthe following morning; each deceived the other, and each was in turn\r\ndeceived. There was more of tenderness in Flora\u2019s manner than there had\r\never been; it cheered his faltering soul, about to quit her, while the\r\nanticipation of the blow he was about to receive from her made her\r\nregard as venial this momentary softening towards her brother\u2019s enemy.\r\n\r\nFabian passed the night at the villa, and early the next morning he\r\ndeparted for Milan. He was impatient to arrive at the end of his\r\njourney, and often he thrust his spurs into his horse\u2019s sides, and put\r\nhim to his speed, which even then appeared slow. Yet he was aware that\r\nhis arrival at Milan might advance him not a jot towards the ultimate\r\nobject of his journey; and he called Flora cruel and unkind, until the\r\nrecollection of her kind farewell consoled and cheered him.\r\n\r\nHe stopped the first night at Empoli, and, crossing the Arno, began to\r\nascend the Apennines on the northern side. Soon he penetrated their\r\nfastnesses, and entered deep into the ilex woods. He journeyed on\r\nperseveringly, and yet the obstructions he met with were many, and borne\r\nwith impatience. At length, on the afternoon of the third day, he\r\narrived at a little rustic inn, hid deep in a wood, which showed signs\r\nof seldom being visited by travellers. The burning sun made it a welcome\r\nshelter for Fabian; and he deposited his steed in the stable, which he\r\nfound already partly occupied by a handsome black horse, and then\r\nentered the inn to seek refreshment for himself. There seemed some\r\ndifficulty in obtaining this. The landlady was the sole domestic, and it\r\nwas long before she made her appearance, and then she was full of\r\ntrouble and dismay; a sick traveller had arrived\u2014a gentleman to all\r\nappearance dying of a malignant fever. His horse, his well-stored purse,\r\nand rich dress showed that he was a cavalier of consequence;\u2014the more\r\nthe pity. There was no help, nor any means of carrying him forward; yet\r\nhalf his pain seemed to arise from his regret at being detained\u2014he was\r\nso eager to proceed to Siena. The name of his own town excited the\r\ninterest of Count Fabian, and he went up to visit the stranger, while\r\nthe hostess prepared his repast.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Flora awoke with the lark, and with the assistance of Angeline\r\nattired herself in her pilgrim\u2019s garb. From the stir below, she was\r\nsurprised to find that Count Fabian had passed the night at the villa,\r\nand she lingered till he should have departed, as she believed, on his\r\nreturn to Siena. Then she embraced her young friend, and taking leave of\r\nher with many blessings and thanks, alone, with Heaven, as she trusted,\r\nfor her guide, she quitted Fabian\u2019s sheltering roof, and with a heart\r\nthat maintained its purpose in spite of her feminine timidity, began her\r\npilgrimage. Her journey performed on foot was slow, so that there was no\r\nlikelihood that she could overtake her lover, already many miles in\r\nadvance. Now that she had begun it, her undertaking appeared to her\r\ngigantic, and her heart almost failed her. The burning sun scorched her;\r\nnever having before found herself alone in a highway, a thousand fears\r\nassailed her, and she grew so weary, that soon she was unable to support\r\nherself. By the advice of a landlady at an inn where she stopped, she\r\npurchased a mule to help her on her long journey. Yet with this help it\r\nwas the third night before she arrived at Empoli, and then crossing the\r\nArno, as her lover had done before, her difficulties seemed to begin to\r\nunfold themselves, and to grow gigantic, as she entered the dark woods\r\nof the Apennines, and found herself amidst the solitude of its vast\r\nforests. Her pilgrim\u2019s garb inspired some respect, and she rested at\r\nconvents by the way. The pious sisters held up their hands in admiration\r\nof her courage; while her heart beat faintly with the knowledge that she\r\npossessed absolutely none. Yet, again and again, she repeated to\r\nherself, that the Apennines once passed, the worst would be over. So she\r\ntoiled on, now weary, now frightened\u2014very slowly, and yet very anxious\r\nto get on with speed.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the seventh day after quitting her home, she was still\r\nentangled in the mazes of these savage hills. She was to sleep at a\r\nconvent on their summit that night, and the next day arrive at Bologna.\r\nThis hope had cheered her through the day; but evening approached, the\r\nway grew more intricate, and no convent appeared. The sun had set, and\r\nshe listened anxiously for the bell of the Ave Maria, which would give\r\nher hope that the goal she sought was nigh; but all was silent, save the\r\nswinging boughs of the vast trees, and the timid beating of her own\r\nheart; darkness closed around her, and despair came with the increased\r\nobscurity, till a twinkling light, revealing itself among the trees,\r\nafforded her some relief. She followed this beamy guide till it led her\r\nto a little inn, where the sight of a kind-looking woman, and the\r\nassurance of safe shelter, dispelled her terrors, and filled her with\r\ngrateful pleasure.\r\n\r\nSeeing her so weary, the considerate hostess hastened to place food\r\nbefore her, and then conducted her to a little low room where her bed\r\nwas prepared. \u201cI am sorry, lady,\u201d said the landlady in a whisper, \u201cnot\r\nto be able to accommodate you better; but a sick cavalier occupies my\r\nbest room\u2014it is next to this\u2014and he sleeps now, and I would not disturb\r\nhim. Poor gentleman! I never thought he would rise more; and under\r\nHeaven he owes his life to one who, whether he is related to him or not\r\nI cannot tell, for he did not accompany him. Four days ago he stopped\r\nhere, and I told him my sorrow\u2014how I had a dying guest, and he\r\ncharitably saw him, and has since then nursed him more like a\r\ntwin-brother than a stranger.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe good woman prattled on. Flora heard but little of what she said; and\r\novercome by weariness and sleep, paid no attention to her tale. But\r\nhaving performed her orisons, and placed her head on the pillow, she was\r\nquickly lapped in the balmy slumber she so much needed.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning she was awoke by a murmur of voices in the next\r\nroom. She started up, and recalling her scattered thoughts, tried to\r\nremember the account the hostess had given her the preceding evening.\r\nThe sick man spoke, but his accent was low, and the words did not reach\r\nher;\u2014he was answered\u2014could Flora believe her senses? did she not know\r\nthe voice that spoke these words?\u2014\u201cFear nothing, a sweet sleep has done\r\nyou infinite good; and I rejoice in the belief that you will speedily\r\nrecover. I have sent to Siena for your sister, and do indeed expect that\r\nFlora will arrive this very day.\u201d\r\n\r\nMore was said, but Flora heard no more; she had risen, and was hastily\r\ndressing herself; in a few minutes she was by her brother\u2019s, her\r\nLorenzo\u2019s bedside, kissing his wan hand, and assuring him that she was\r\nindeed Flora.\r\n\r\n\u201cThese are indeed wonders,\u201d he at last said; \u201cand if you are mine own\r\nFlora you perhaps can tell me who this noble gentleman is, who day and\r\nnight has watched beside me, as a mother may by her only child, giving\r\nno time to repose, but exhausting himself for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow, dearest brother,\u201d said Flora, \u201ccan I truly answer your question?\r\nto mention the name of our benefactor were to speak of a mask and a\r\ndisguise, not a true thing. He is my protector and guardian, who has\r\nwatched over and preserved me while you wandered far; his is the most\r\ngenerous heart in Italy, offering past enmity and family pride as\r\nsacrifices at the altar of nobleness and truth. He is the restorer of\r\nyour fortunes in your native town\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the lover of my sweet sister.\u2014I have heard of these things, and was\r\non my way to confirm his happiness and to find my own, when sickness\r\nlaid me thus low, and would have destroyed us both for ever, but for\r\nFabian Tolomei\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWho how exerts his expiring authority to put an end to this scene,\u201d\r\ninterrupted the young count. \u201cNot till this day has Lorenzo been\r\nsufficiently composed to hear any of these explanations, and we risk his\r\nreturning health by too long a conversation. The history of these things\r\nand of his long wanderings, now so happily ended, must be reserved for a\r\nfuture hour; when assembled in our beloved Siena, exiles and foes no\r\nlonger, we shall long enjoy the happiness which Providence, after so\r\nmany trials, has bounteously reserved for us.\u201d\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XIII.\r\n\r\n                            _THE PARVENUE._\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY do I write my melancholy story? Is it as a lesson, to prevent any\r\nother from wishing to rise to rank superior to that in which they are\r\nborn? No! miserable as I am, others might have been happy, I doubt not,\r\nin my position: the chalice has been poisoned for me alone! Am I\r\nevil-minded\u2014am I wicked? What have been my errors, that I am now an\r\noutcast and wretched? I will tell my story\u2014let others judge me; my mind\r\nis bewildered, I cannot judge myself.\r\n\r\nMy father was land steward to a wealthy nobleman. He married young, and\r\nhad several children. He then lost his wife, and remained fifteen years\r\na widower, when he married again a young girl, the daughter of a\r\nclergyman, who died, leaving a numerous offspring in extreme poverty. My\r\nmaternal grandfather had been a man of sensibility and genius; my mother\r\ninherited many of his endowments. She was an angel on earth; all her\r\nworks were charity, all her thoughts were love.\r\n\r\nWithin a year after her marriage, she gave birth to twins\u2014I and my\r\nsister; soon after she fell into ill-health, and from that time was\r\nalways weakly. She could endure no fatigue, and seldom moved from her\r\nchair. I see her now;\u2014her white, delicate hands employed in needlework,\r\nher soft, love-lighted eyes fixed on me. I was still a child when my\r\nfather fell into trouble, and we removed from the part of the country\r\nwhere we had hitherto lived, and went to a distant village, where we\r\nrented a cottage, with a little land adjoining. We were poor, and all\r\nthe family assisted each other. My elder half-sisters were strong,\r\nindustrious, rustic young women, and submitted to a life of labour with\r\ngreat cheerfulness. My father held the plough, my half-brothers worked\r\nin the barns; all was toil, yet all seemed enjoyment.\r\n\r\nHow happy my childhood was! Hand in hand with my dear twin-sister, I\r\nplucked the spring flowers in the hedges, turned the hay in the summer\r\nmeadows, shook the apples from the trees in the autumn, and at all\r\nseasons, gambolled in delicious liberty beneath the free air of heaven;\r\nor at my mother\u2019s feet, caressed by her, I was taught the sweetest\r\nlessons of charity and love. My elder sisters were kind; we were all\r\nlinked by strong affection. The delicate, fragile existence of my mother\r\ngave an interest to our monotony, while her virtues and her refinement\r\nthrew a grace over our homely household.\r\n\r\nI and my sister did not seem twins, we were so unlike. She was robust,\r\nchubby, full of life and spirits; I, tall, slim, fair, and even pale. I\r\nloved to play with her, but soon grew tired, and then I crept to my\r\nmother\u2019s side, and she sang me to sleep, and nursed me in her bosom, and\r\nlooked on me with her own angelic smile. She took pains to instruct me,\r\nnot in accomplishments, but in all real knowledge. She unfolded to me\r\nthe wonders of the visible creation, and to each tale of bird and beast,\r\nof fiery mountain or vast river, was appended some moral, derived from\r\nher warm heart and ardent imagination. Above all, she impressed upon me\r\nthe precepts of the gospel, charity to every fellow-creature, the\r\nbrotherhood of mankind, the rights that every sentient creature\r\npossesses to our services. I was her almoner; for, poor as she was, she\r\nwas the benefactress of those who were poorer. Being delicate, I helped\r\nher in her task of needlework, while my sister aided the rest in their\r\nhousehold or rustic labours.\r\n\r\nWhen I was seventeen, a miserable accident happened. A hayrick caught\r\nfire; it communicated to our outhouses, and at last to the cottage. We\r\nwere roused from our beds at midnight, and escaped barely with our\r\nlives. My father bore out my mother in his arms, and then tried to save\r\na portion of his property. The roof of the cottage fell in on him. He\r\nwas dug out after an hour, scorched, maimed, crippled for life.\r\n\r\nWe were all saved, but by a miracle only was I preserved. I and my\r\nsister were awoke by cries of fire. The cottage was already enveloped in\r\nflames. Susan, with her accustomed intrepidity, rushed through the\r\nflames, and escaped; I thought only of my mother, and hurried to her\r\nroom. The fire raged around me; it encircled\u2014hemmed me in. I believed\r\nthat I must die, when suddenly I felt myself seized upon and borne away.\r\nI looked on my preserver\u2014it was Lord Reginald Desborough.\r\n\r\nFor many Sundays past, when, at church, I knew that Lord Reginald\u2019s eyes\r\nwere fixed on me. He had met me and Susan in our walks; he had called at\r\nour cottage. There was fascination in his eye, in his soft voice and\r\nearnest gaze, and my heart throbbed with gladness, as I thought that he\r\nsurely loved me. To have been saved by him was to make the boon of life\r\ndoubly precious.\r\n\r\nThere is to me much obscurity in this part of my story. Lord Reginald\r\nloved me, it is true; why he loved me, so far as to forget pride of rank\r\nand ambition for my sake, he who afterwards showed no tendency to\r\ndisregard the prejudices and habits of rank and wealth, I cannot tell;\r\nit seems strange. He had loved me before, but from the hour that he\r\nsaved my life, love grew into an overpowering passion. He offered us a\r\nlodge on his estate to take refuge in; and while there, he sent us\r\npresents of game, and still more kindly, fruits and flowers to my\r\nmother, and came himself, especially, when all were out except my mother\r\nand myself, and sat by us and conversed. Soon I learnt to expect the\r\nsoft-asking look of his eyes, and almost dared answer it. My mother once\r\nperceived these glances, and took an opportunity to appeal to Lord\r\nReginald\u2019s good feelings, not to make me miserable for life, by\r\nimplanting an attachment that could only be productive of unhappiness.\r\nHis answer was to ask me in marriage.\r\n\r\nI need not say that my mother gratefully consented; that my father,\r\nconfined to his bed since the fire, thanked God with rapture; that my\r\nsisters were transported by delight: I was the least surprised then,\r\nthough the most happy. Now, I wonder much, what could he see in me? So\r\nmany girls of rank and fortune were prettier. I was an untaught,\r\nlow-born, portionless girl. It was very strange.\r\n\r\nThen I only thought of the happiness of marrying him, of being loved, of\r\npassing my life with him. My wedding day was fixed. Lord Reginald had\r\nneither father nor mother to interfere with his arrangements. He told no\r\nrelation; he became one of our family during the interval. He saw no\r\ndeficiencies in our mode of life\u2014in my dress; he was satisfied with all;\r\nhe was tender, assiduous, and kind, even to my elder sisters; he seemed\r\nto adore my mother, and became a brother to my sister Susan. She was in\r\nlove, and asked him to intercede to gain her parents\u2019 consent for her\r\nchoice. He did so; and though before, Lawrence Cooper, the carpenter of\r\nthe place, had been disdained, supported by him, he was accepted.\r\nLawrence Cooper was young, well-looking, well disposed, and fondly\r\nattached to Susan.\r\n\r\nMy wedding day came. My mother kissed me fondly, my father blessed me\r\nwith pride and joy, my sisters stood round, radiant with delight. There\r\nwas but one drawback to the universal happiness\u2014that immediately on my\r\nmarriage I was to go abroad.\r\n\r\nFrom the church door I stepped into the carriage. Having once and again\r\nbeen folded in my dear mother\u2019s embrace, the wheels were in motion, and\r\nwe were away. I looked out from the window; there was the dear group: my\r\nold father, white-headed and aged, in his large chair; my mother,\r\nsmiling through her tears, with folded hands and upraised looks of\r\ngratitude, anticipating long years of happiness for her child; Susan and\r\nLawrence standing side by side, unenvious of my greatness, happy in\r\nthemselves; my sisters conning over with pride and joy the presents made\r\nto them, and the prosperity that flowed in from my husband\u2019s generosity.\r\nAll looked happy, and it seemed as if I were the cause of all this\r\nhappiness. We had been indeed saved from dreadful evils; ruin had ensued\r\nfrom the fire, and we had been sunk in adversity through that very event\r\nfrom which our good fortune took its rise. I felt proud and glad. I\r\nloved them all. I thought, I make them happy\u2014they are prosperous through\r\nme! And my heart warmed with gratitude towards my husband at the idea.\r\n\r\nWe spent two years abroad. It was rather lonely for me, who had always\r\nbeen surrounded, as it were, by a populous world of my own, to find\r\nmyself cast upon foreigners and strangers; the habits of the different\r\nsexes in the higher ranks so separate them from each other, that, after\r\na few months, I spent much of my time in solitude. I did not repine; I\r\nhad been brought up to look upon the hard visage of life, if not\r\nunflinchingly, at least with resignation. I did not expect perfect\r\nhappiness. Marriages in humble life are attended with so much care. I\r\nhad none of this: my husband loved me; and though I often longed to see\r\nthe dear familiar faces that thronged my childhood\u2019s home, and, above\r\nall, pined for my mother\u2019s caresses and her wise maternal lessons, yet\r\nfor a time I was content to think of them, and hope for a reunion.\r\n\r\nStill many things pained me. I had, poor myself, been brought up among\r\nthe poor, and nothing, since I can remember forming an idea, so much\r\nastonished and jarred with my feelings as the thought of how the rich\r\ncould spend so much on themselves, while any of their fellow-creatures\r\nwere in destitution. I had none of the patrician charity (though such is\r\npraiseworthy), which consists in distributing thin soup and coarse\r\nflannel petticoats\u2014a sort of instinct or sentiment of justice, the\r\noffspring of my lowly paternal hearth, and my mother\u2019s enlightened\r\npiety, was deeply implanted in my mind, that all had as good a right to\r\nthe comforts of life as myself, or even as my husband. My charities,\r\nthey were called\u2014they seemed to me the payment of my debts to my\r\nfellow-creatures\u2014were abundant. Lord Reginald peremptorily checked them;\r\nbut as I had a large allowance for my own expenses, I denied myself a\r\nthousand luxuries, for the sake of feeding the hungry. Nor was it only\r\nthat charity impelled me, but that I could not acquire a taste for\r\nspending money on myself\u2014I disliked the apparatus of wealth. My husband\r\ncalled my ideas sordid, and reproved me severely, when, instead of\r\noutshining all competitors at a f\u00eate, I appeared dowdily dressed, and\r\ndeclared warmly that I could not, I would not, spend twenty guineas on a\r\ngown, while I could dress many sad faces in smiles, and bring much joy\r\nto many drooping hearts, by the same sum.\r\n\r\nWas I right? I firmly believe that there is not one among the rich who\r\nwill not affirm that I did wrong; that to please my husband, and do\r\nhonour to his rank, was my first duty. Yet, shall I confess it? even\r\nnow, rendered miserable by this fault\u2014I cannot give it that name\u2014I can\r\ncall it a misfortune\u2014I have wasted at the slow fire of knowing that I\r\nlost my husband\u2019s affections because I performed what I believed to be a\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nBut I am not come to that yet. It was not till my return to England that\r\nthe full disaster crushed me. We had often been applied to for money by\r\nmy family, and Lord Reginald had acceded to nearly all their requests.\r\nWhen we reached London, after two years\u2019 absence, my first wish was to\r\nsee my dear mother. She was at Margate for her health. It was agreed\r\nthat I should go there alone, and pay a short visit. Before I went, Lord\r\nReginald told me what I did not know before, that my family had often\r\nmade exorbitant demands on him, with which he was resolved not to\r\ncomply. He told me that he had no wish to raise my relatives from their\r\nstation in society; and that, indeed, there were only two among them\r\nwhom he conceived had any claims upon me\u2014my mother and my twin-sister:\r\nthat the former was incapable of any improper request and the latter, by\r\nmarrying Cooper, had fixed her own position, and could in no way be\r\nraised from the rank of her chosen husband. I agreed to much that he\r\nsaid. I replied that he well knew that my own taste led me to consider\r\nmediocrity the best and happiest situation; that I had no wish, and\r\nwould never consent, to supply any extravagant demands on the part of\r\npersons, however dear to me, whose circumstances he had rendered easy.\r\n\r\nSatisfied with my reply, we parted most affectionately, and I went on my\r\nway to Margate with a light and glad heart; and the cordial reception I\r\nreceived from my whole family collected together to receive me, was\r\ncalculated to add to my satisfaction. The only drawback to my content\r\nwas my mother\u2019s state; she was wasted to a shadow. They all talked and\r\nlaughed around her, but it was evident to me that she had not long to\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nThere was no room for me in the small furnished house in which they were\r\nall crowded, so I remained at the hotel. Early in the morning, before I\r\nwas up, my father visited me. He begged me to intercede with my husband;\r\nthat on the strength of his support he had embarked in a speculation\r\nwhich required a large capital; that many families would be ruined, and\r\nhimself dishonoured, if a few hundreds were not advanced. I promised to\r\ndo what I could, resolving to ask my mother\u2019s advice, and make her my\r\nguide. My father kissed me with an effusion of gratitude, and left me.\r\n\r\nI cannot enter into the whole of these sad details; all my half-brothers\r\nand sisters had married, and trusted to their success in life to Lord\r\nReginald\u2019s assistance. Each evidently thought that they asked little in\r\nnot demanding an equal share of my luxuries and fortune; but they were\r\nall in difficulty\u2014all needed large assistance\u2014all depended on me.\r\n\r\nLastly, my own sister Susan appealed to me\u2014but hers was the most\r\nmoderate request of all\u2014she only wished for twenty pounds. I gave it her\r\nat once from my own purse.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I saw my mother I explained to her my difficulties. She told\r\nme that she expected this, and that it broke her heart: I must summon\r\ncourage and resist these demands. That my father\u2019s imprudence had ruined\r\nhim, and that he must encounter the evil he had brought on himself; that\r\nmy numerous relatives were absolutely mad with the notion of what I\r\nought to do for them. I listened with grief\u2014I saw the torments in store\r\nfor me\u2014I felt my own weakness, and knew that I could not meet the\r\nrapacity of those about me with any courage or firmness. That same night\r\nmy mother fell into convulsions; her life was saved with difficulty.\r\nFrom Susan I learned the cause of her attack. She had had a violent\r\naltercation with my father: she insisted that I should not be appealed\r\nto; while he reproached her for rendering me undutiful, and bringing\r\nruin and disgrace on his grey hairs. When I saw my pale mother\r\ntrembling, fainting, dying\u2014when I was again and again assured that she\r\nmust be my father\u2019s victim unless I yielded, what wonder that, in the\r\nagony of my distress, I wrote to my husband to implore his assistance.\r\n\r\nOh, what thick clouds now obscured my destiny! how do I remember, with a\r\nsort of thrilling horror, the boundless sea, white cliffs, and wide\r\nsands of Margate! The summer day that had welcomed my arrival changed to\r\nbleak wintry weather during this interval\u2014while I waited with anguish\r\nfor my husband\u2019s answer. Well do I remember the evening on which it\r\ncame: the waves of the sea showed their white crests, no vessel ventured\r\nto meet the gale with any canvas except a topsail, the sky was bared\r\nclear by the wind, the sun was going down fiery red. I looked upon the\r\ntroubled waters\u2014I longed to be borne away upon them, away from care and\r\nmisery. At this moment a servant followed me to the sands with my\r\nhusband\u2019s answer\u2014it contained a refusal. I dared not communicate it. The\r\nmenaces of bankruptcy; the knowledge that he had instilled false hopes\r\ninto so many; the fears of disgrace, rendered my father, always rough,\r\nabsolutely ferocious. Life flickered in my dear mother\u2019s frame, it\r\nseemed on the point of expiring when she heard my father\u2019s step; if he\r\ncame in with a smooth brow, her pale lips wreathed into her own sweet\r\nsmile, and a delicate pink tinged her fallen cheeks; if he scowled, and\r\nhis voice was high, every limb shivered, she turned her face to her\r\npillow, while convulsive tears shook her frame, and threatened instant\r\ndissolution. My father sought me alone one day, as I was walking in\r\nmelancholy guise upon the sands; he swore that he would not survive his\r\ndisgrace. \u201cAnd do you think, Fanny,\u201d he added \u201cthat your mother will\r\nsurvive the knowledge of my miserable end?\u201d I saw the resolution of\r\ndespair in his face as he spoke.\u2014I asked the sum needed, the time when\r\nit must be given.\u2014A thousand pounds in two days was all that was asked.\r\nI set off to London to implore my husband to give this sum.\r\n\r\nNo! no! I cannot step by step record my wretchedness\u2014the money was\r\ngiven\u2014I extorted it from Lord Reginald, though I saw his very heart\r\nclosed on me as he wrote the cheque. Worse had happened since I had left\r\nhim. Susan had used the twenty pounds I gave her to reach town, to throw\r\nherself at my husband\u2019s feet, and implore his compassion. Rendered\r\nabsolutely insane by the idea of having a lord for a brother-in-law,\r\nCooper had launched into a system of extravagance, incredible as it was\r\nwicked. He was many thousand pounds in debt, and when at last Lord\r\nReginald wrote to refuse all further supply, the miserable man committed\r\nforgery. Two hundred pounds prevented exposure, and preserved him from\r\nan ignominious end. Five hundred more were advanced to send him and his\r\nwife to America, to settle there, out of the way of temptation. I parted\r\nfrom my dear sister\u2014I loved her fondly; she had no part in her husband\u2019s\r\nguilt, yet she was still attached to him, and her child bound them\r\ntogether; they went into solitary, miserable exile. \u201cAh! had we remained\r\nin virtuous poverty,\u201d cried my broken-hearted sister, \u201cI had not been\r\nforced to leave my dying mother.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe thousand pounds given to my father was but a drop of water in the\r\nocean. Again I was appealed to; again I felt the slender thread of my\r\nmother\u2019s life depended on my getting a supply. Again, trembling and\r\nmiserable, I implored the charity of my husband.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am content,\u201d he said, \u201cto do what you ask, to do more than you ask;\r\nbut remember the price you pay\u2014either give up your parents and your\r\nfamily, whose rapacity and crimes deserve no mercy, or we part for ever.\r\nYou shall have a proper allowance; you can maintain all your family on\r\nit if you please; but their names must never be mentioned to me again.\r\nChoose between us\u2014you never see them more, or we part for ever.\u201d\r\n\r\nDid I do right\u2014I cannot tell\u2014misery is the result\u2014misery frightful,\r\nendless, unredeemed. My mother was dearer to me than all the world. I\r\ndid not reply\u2014I rushed to my room, and that night, in a delirium of\r\ngrief and horror, I set out for Margate\u2014such was my reply to my husband.\r\n\r\nThree years have passed since then; and during all this time I was\r\ngrateful to Heaven for being permitted to do my duty by my mother; and\r\nthough I wept over the alienation of my husband, I did not repent. But\r\nshe, my angelic support, is no more. My father survived my mother but\r\ntwo months; remorse for all he had done, and made me suffer, cut short\r\nhis life. His family by his first wife are gathered round me; they\r\nimportune, they rob, they destroy me. Last week I wrote to Lord\r\nReginald. I communicated the death of my parents; I represented that my\r\nposition was altered; and that if he still cared for his unhappy wife\r\nall might be well. Yesterday his answer came.\u2014It was too late, he\r\nsaid;\u2014I had myself torn asunder the ties that united us\u2014they never could\r\nbe knit together again.\r\n\r\nBy the same post came a letter from Susan. She is happy. Cooper,\r\nawakened to a manly sense of the duties of life, is thoroughly reformed.\r\nHe is industrious and prosperous. Susan asks me to join her. I am\r\nresolved to go. Oh! my home, and recollections of my youth, where are ye\r\nnow? envenomed by serpents\u2019 stings, I long to dose my eyes on every\r\nscene I have ever viewed. Let me seek a strange land, a land where a\r\ngrave will soon be opened for me. I desire to die. I am told that Lord\r\nReginald loves another, a high-born girl; that he openly curses our\r\nunion as the obstacle to his happiness. The memory of this will poison\r\nthe oblivion I go to seek. He will soon be free. Soon will the hand he\r\nonce so fondly took in his and made his own, which, now flung away,\r\ntrembles with misery as it traces these lines, moulder in its last\r\ndecay.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIV.\r\n\r\n                              _THE POLE._\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was near the close of day that a travelling cal\u00e8che, coming from\r\nRome, was seen approaching at full gallop towards Mola di Gaeta. The\r\nroad leading to the inn is rocky and narrow; on one side is an orange\r\ngrove, extending to the sea; on the other, an old Roman wall, overgrown\r\nby blossoming shrubs, enormous aloes, floating tangles of vines, and a\r\nthousand species of parasite plants peculiar to the South. Scarcely had\r\nthe cal\u00e8che entered this defile, when the careless postillion drove one\r\nof the wheels over a protruding ledge of rock, and overturned it; and,\r\nin the next moment, a crowd of people came running to the spot. Not one\r\nof them, however, thought of relieving the traveller within the fallen\r\nvehicle; but, with violent gestures and loud outcries, began to examine\r\nwhat damage the cal\u00e8che had sustained, and what profit they might derive\r\nfrom it. The wheelwright declared every wheel was shattered; the\r\ncarpenter that the shafts were splintered; whilst the blacksmith,\r\npassing and repassing under the carriage, tugged at every clamp and\r\nscrew and nail, with all the violence necessary to ensure himself a\r\nhandsome job. The traveller it contained having quietly disengaged\r\nhimself from various cloaks, books, and maps, now slowly descended, and\r\nfor a moment the busy crowd forgot their restlessness, to gaze upon the\r\nnoble figure of the stranger. He seemed to be scarcely two-and-twenty.\r\nIn stature he was tall, and his form was moulded in such perfect\r\nproportions, that it presented a rare combination of youthful lightness\r\nand manly strength. His countenance, had you taken from it its deep\r\nthoughtfulness and its expression of calm intrepid bravery, might have\r\nbelonged to the most lovely woman, so transparently blooming was his\r\ncomplexion, so regular his features, so blond and luxuriant his hair. Of\r\nall those present, he seemed the least concerned at the accident; he\r\nneither looked at the cal\u00e8che, nor paid any attention to the offers of\r\nservice that were screamed from a dozen mouths; but, drawing out his\r\nwatch, asked his servant if the carriage was broken.\r\n\r\n\u201cPann,[4] the shafts are snapped, two of the springs are injured, and\r\nthe linch-pin has flown.\u201d\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  My Lord, in Polish.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long will it take to repair them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTwenty-four hours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is now four o\u2019clock. See that everything be in order again by\r\nto-morrow\u2019s daybreak.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPann, with these lazy Italians, I fear it will be impossible\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYa paswalam,\u201d[5] replied the traveller coldly, but decidedly. \u201cPay what\r\nyou will, but let all be ready for the hour I have mentioned.\u201d\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  I will it, in Polish.\r\n\r\nWithout another word, he walked towards the inn, followed by the crowd,\r\nteasing for alms. A few seconds ago they had all been active and healthy\r\nbeings, so full of employment they could not afford to mend his cal\u00e8che\r\nunless tempted by some extraordinary reward; now the men declared\r\nthemselves cripples and invalids, the children were orphans, the women\r\nhelpless widows, and they would all die of hunger if his Eccellenza did\r\nnot bestow a few _grani_. \u201cWhat a tedious race!\u201d exclaimed the\r\ntraveller, casting a handful of coins upon the ground, which caused a\r\ngeneral scramble, and enabled him to proceed unmolested. At the inn new\r\ntorments awaited him; a fresh crowd, composed of the landlord, the\r\nlandlady, and their waiters and hostlers, gathered round, and assailed\r\nhim with innumerable questions. The landlord hoped none of his limbs\r\nwere broken, and begged him to consider himself master of the house; the\r\nwaiters desired to know at what hour he would sup, what fare he chose,\r\nhow long he intended to stay, where he came from, whither he was going;\r\nand the landlady led him, ostentatiously, through all the rooms of the\r\ninn, expatiating endlessly upon the peculiar and indescribable\r\nadvantages of each. Ineffably weary of their officiousness, the\r\ntraveller at last traversed a long and spacious hall, and took refuge in\r\na balcony that looked upon the bay of Gaeta.\r\n\r\nThe inn is built upon the site of Cicero\u2019s Villa. Beneath the balcony,\r\nand on each side, along the whole curve of the bay, stretched a thick\r\ngrove of orange-trees, which sloped down to the very verge of the\r\nMediterranean. Balls of golden fruit, and blossoms faint with odour, and\r\nfair as stars, studded this amphitheatre of dark foliage; and at its\r\nextremity the liquid light of the waves pierced the glossy leaves,\r\nmingling their blue splendour with earth\u2019s green paradise. Every rock\r\nand mountain glowed with a purple hue, so intense and soft, they\r\nresembled violet vapours dissolving into the pale radiance of the\r\nevening sky. Far away in the deep broad flood of the ocean rose the two\r\nmountain islands of Ischia and Procida, between which Vesuvius thrust in\r\nhis jagged form, and his floating banner of snow-white smoke. The\r\nsolitary heaven was without sun or moon, without a star or cloud, but\r\nsmiled in that tender vestal light which speaks of eternal, immutable\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to define the feelings of the traveller as he\r\ngazed on this scene: his countenance, uplifted to heaven, was animated\r\nwith a profound and impassioned melancholy, with an expression of an\r\nearnest and fervid pleading against some vast and inevitable wrong. He\r\nwas thinking of his country; and whilst he contrasted its ruined\r\nvillages and devastated fields with the splendour and glow of the fair\r\nland before him, was breathing inwardly a passionate appeal against that\r\nblind and cruel destiny which had consigned Poland to the desolating\r\ninfluence of Russian despotism. His reverie was interrupted by the sound\r\nof a female voice singing in Polish among the orange-trees at his feet.\r\nThe singer was invisible; but the sweetness of her voice, and the\r\nsingular reference of the words (the following prose translation conveys\r\ntheir meaning) to the thoughts of his own mind, filled the traveller\r\nwith surprise:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen thou gazest upon the azure heaven, so mighty in its calm, do not\r\nsay, O bright enchantment, hast thou no pity, that thou dawnest thus in\r\nunattainable loveliness upon my world-wearied eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen the southern wind softly breathes, do not say reproachfully, Thy\r\ncradle is the ether of the morning sun, thou drinkest the odorous\r\nessence of myrtle and lemon blossoms; thou shouldst bear upon thy wings\r\nall sweet emotions, all soft desires; why bringest thou then no healing\r\nto the anguish I endure?\r\n\r\n\u201cNeither in the dark hour, when thou thinkest upon thy country and thy\r\nfriends, say not with grief, They are lost! They are not! Say rather\r\nwith joy, They were illustrious! and it is bliss to know that they have\r\nbeen!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt were wise in me to obey thy lesson, sweet songstress, thought the\r\ntraveller; and revolving in his mind the singularity of the serenade, he\r\ncontinued to gaze upon the trees below. There was no rustling amid their\r\nbranches, no sound which told a human being was concealed beneath their\r\nfoliage; nothing was heard beyond the almost imperceptible breathings of\r\nthe evening air. Did such things exist anywhere but in the imagination\r\nof the poet? He could almost have believed that the spirit of that\r\ndivine scene had assumed a human voice and human words to soothe his\r\nmelancholy, so floating and airy had been the strain, so deep the\r\nsilence that succeeded it. One moment more, and there arose from the\r\nsame spot cries for help uttered in Italian, and shrieks of distress so\r\npiercing, they made the traveller fly with the speed of lightning\r\nthrough the great hall, down the staircase into the garden. The first\r\nobject that met his eyes was the figure of a girl about sixteen, her one\r\narm tightly embracing the stem of a tree, her other angrily repelling a\r\nyoung man who was endeavouring to drag her away.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will not go with you\u2014I love you no longer, Giorgio\u2014and go with you, I\r\nwill not,\u201d shrieked the girl, in tones of mingled violence and fear.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must\u2014you shall,\u201d retorted her aggressor in a voice of thunder.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have found you again, and I won\u2019t be duped by your fooleries,\r\nMarietta.\u2014And who are you, and who begged you to interfere?\u201d added he,\r\nturning fiercely upon the traveller, whose strong grasp had torn him\r\nfrom Marietta.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn officer, as it should seem by your dress;\u2014be pleased to know that I\r\nam also an officer, and risk my displeasure no further.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo officer would ill-treat a defenceless girl,\u201d the Pole replied with\r\nquiet contempt.\r\n\r\nAt this taunt Giorgio quivered with rage. His features, handsome and\r\nregular as those of Italians generally are, became quite distorted. His\r\nhands with convulsive movements sought about his breast for the dagger\r\nthat was concealed there, his dark flashing eyes fixed intently at the\r\nsame time upon his adversary, as if he hoped the fiendish spirit that\r\nburned within them might previously annihilate him.\r\n\r\n\u201cBe on your guard\u2014he is a perfect wretch,\u201d cried Marietta, rushing\r\ntowards her protector.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of several servants from the inn dispelled all idea of\r\npresent danger: they dragged off Giorgio, telling him that, although the\r\ngirl was his sister, he had no right to separate her from the _corps\r\nd\u2019opera_, with whom she was travelling through Gaeta.\r\n\r\n\u201c_E vero \u00e8 verissimo_,\u201d cried Marietta with joyful triumph.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it to him if I like my liberty, and prefer wandering about,\r\nsinging here and there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMarietta! beware! dare not to speak ill of me!\u201d screamed the retiring\r\nGiorgio, looking back over his shoulder, and accompanying his words with\r\na look of such frightful menace as completely subdued his sister.\r\n\r\nShe watched in anxious silence till he had disappeared, and then, with\r\naffectionate humility and a graceful quickness that allowed not of its\r\nprevention, knelt lightly down, and pressed the stranger\u2019s hand to her\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have more than repaid me for the song I sang to you,\u201d she said,\r\nrising and leading the way to the inn; \u201cand, if you like it, I will sing\r\nothers to you whilst you sup.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you a Pole?\u201d inquired the traveller.\r\n\r\n\u201cA fine demand! how can I be a Pole? Did you not say yourself there was\r\nno longer any such country as Poland?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI? not that I recollect.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you did not say it, confess at least that you thought it. The Poles\r\nare all become Russians, and for nothing in the world, Signor, would I\r\nbe a Russian. Why in all their language they have no word that expresses\r\n_honour_.[6] No! rather than be a Russian, much as I hate it, I would go\r\nwith Giorgio.\u201d\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  This is true. The Russian language is without that word.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you an Italian?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014not exactly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUm! I am what I am; who can be more? But, Signor, one thing I must beg\r\nof you, do not ask me any questions about myself, nor any about Giorgio.\r\nI will sing to you, talk to you, wait upon you\u2014anything of that kind you\r\nplease, but I will not answer questions on those subjects.\u201d\r\n\r\nSeating herself upon a stool, in a dark corner of the traveller\u2019s\r\napartment, as far removed as possible from him, and all other\r\ninterruptions, Marietta passed the evening in playing on her guitar and\r\nsinging. She was a most accomplished singer, possessing and managing all\r\nthe intricacies of the art with perfect ease, but this scarcely excited\r\nadmiration in comparison with the natural beauty of her voice. There was\r\na profound melancholy in its intense sweetness, that dissolved the soul\r\nof the traveller in grief. All that was dear to him in the memory of the\r\npast,\u2014the joys of home and childhood, the tenderness and truth of his\r\nfirst friendships, the glow of patriotism; every cherished hour, every\r\nendeared spot, all that he had loved, and all that he had lost upon\r\nearth, seemed again to live and again to fade, as he listened to her\r\nstrains. Without paying any attention to him, and apparently without any\r\neffort to herself, she breathed forth melody after melody for her own\r\npleasure, like some lone nightingale, that, in a home of green leaves,\r\nsings to cheer its solitude with sweet sounds. Her countenance and\r\nfigure would have been beautiful had they been more fully developed.\r\nThey resembled those sketches of a great artist in which there are only\r\na few lightly-traced lines, but those so full of spirit and meaning,\r\nthat you easily imagine what a masterpiece it would have been when\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nThe first visit of our traveller, on arriving, next day, at Naples was\r\nto the Princess Dashkhoff. She was a Russian lady, whose high birth,\r\nimmense wealth, and talents for intrigue, had procured for her the\r\nintimacy of half the crowned heads of Europe, and had made her\r\nall-powerful at the Court of St. Petersburg. Detesting the cold\r\nbarbarism of her native country, she had established herself at Naples,\r\nin a splendid mansion, near the Strada Nuova; and affecting an\r\nextravagant admiration for Italy, by her munificent patronage of the\r\narts and artists, and by perpetual exhibitions of her own skill, in\r\ndrawing and singing, dancing and acting, had obtained the name of the\r\nCorinna of the North. Her _salon_ was the evening resort of the wise,\r\nthe idle, the witty, and the dissipated. Not to know Corinna was to be\r\nyourself unknown; and not to frequent her _conversazioni_ was, as far as\r\nsociety was concerned, to be banished from all that was fashionable or\r\ndelightful in Naples.\r\n\r\nIt was the hour of evening reception. The Pole burned with impatience to\r\nspeak to the Princess, for on her influence, at Petersburg, depended the\r\nfate of his only brother. A splendid suite of apartments, blazing with\r\nlights, crowded with company, lay open before him; without allowing\r\nhimself to be announced, he entered them. When a highly imaginative mind\r\nis absorbed by some master feeling, all opposing contrasts, all glowing\r\nextremes, serve but to add depth and intensity to that feeling. The\r\nfestal scene of marble columns garlanded by roses, the walls of Venetian\r\nmirror, reflecting the light of innumerable tapers, and the forms of\r\nlovely women and gay youths floating in the mazy dance, seemed to him\r\ndeceitful shows that veiled some frightful sorrow; and with eager, rapid\r\nsteps, as if borne along by the impulse of his own thoughts, he hurried\r\npast them. Scarcely knowing how he had arrived there, he at length found\r\nhimself standing beside the Princess, in a marble colonnade, open above\r\nto the moonlight and the stars of heaven, and admitting at its sides the\r\nodours of the blossoming almond trees of the adjacent gardens.\r\n\r\n\u201cLadislas!\u201d exclaimed the lady, starting; \u201cis it possible\u2014to see you\r\nhere almost exceeds belief.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter remaining some moments in deep silence, collecting and arranging\r\nhis thoughts, the Pole replied. A conversation ensued, in so low a voice\r\nas to be only audible to themselves; from their attitudes and gestures\r\nit might be inferred that Ladislas was relating some tale of deep\r\nanguish, mixed with solemn and impressive adjurations, to which the\r\nPrincess listened with a consenting tranquillizing sympathy.\r\n\r\nThey issued from the recess, walked up the colonnade, and entered a\r\nsmall temple that terminated it. From the centre of its airy dome hung a\r\nlighted alabaster lamp of a boat-like shape, beneath which a youthful\r\nfemale was seated alone sketching a range of moonlight hills that\r\nappeared between the columns. \u201cIdalie,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cI have\r\nbrought you a new subject for your pencil\u2014and such a subject, my\r\nlove\u2014one whose fame has already made him dear to your imagination; no\r\nless a person than the hero of Ostrolenka[7] and the Vistula. So call up\r\none of those brightest, happiest moods of your genius, in which all\r\nsucceeds to you, and enrich my album with his likeness,\u201d spreading it\r\nbefore her.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  At Ostrolenka, the Russian and Polish armies were in sight of one\r\n  another. The destruction of the Poles seemed inevitable; not expecting\r\n  the attack, their lines were not formed, and the Russians were triple\r\n  in number, and advancing in the most perfect order. In this emergency,\r\n  three hundred students from the University of Warsaw drew hastily up\r\n  in a body, and, devoting themselves willingly to death, marched\r\n  forward to meet the onset of the enemy. They were headed by a young\r\n  man, who distinguished himself by the most exalted courage, and was\r\n  the only one of their numbers who escaped. He stationed his band in a\r\n  small wood that lay directly in the path of the Russians, and checked\r\n  their progress for the space of three hours. Every tree of that wood\r\n  now waves above a patriot\u2019s grave. In the meantime the Polish army\r\n  formed, bore down, and gained a brilliant victory.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to refuse any request to a person who has just granted\r\nus an important favour. Ladislas suffered himself to be seated, and as\r\nsoon as the Princess had quitted them, the gloom which had shadowed his\r\nbrow at the names of Ostrolenka and the Vistula vanished. The surpassing\r\nbeauty of the young artist would have changed the heaviest penance into\r\na pleasure. She was lovely as one of Raffaelle\u2019s Madonnas; and, like\r\nthem, there was a silent beauty in her presence that struck the most\r\nsuperficial beholder with astonishment and satisfaction. Her hair, of a\r\ngolden and burnished brown (the colour of the autumnal foliage\r\nilluminated by the setting sun), fell in gauzy wavings round her face,\r\nthroat, and shoulders. Her small, clear forehead, gleaming with gentle\r\nthought; her curved, soft, and rosy lips; the delicate moulding of the\r\nlower part of the face, expressing purity and integrity of nature, were\r\nall perfectly Grecian. Her hazel eyes, with their arched lids and dark\r\narrowy lashes, pierced the soul with their full and thrilling softness.\r\nShe was clad in long and graceful drapery, white as snow; but, pure as\r\nthis garment was, it seemed a rude disguise to the resplendent softness\r\nof the limbs it enfolded. The delicate light that gleamed from the\r\nalabaster lamp above them was a faint simile of the ineffable spirit of\r\nlove that burned within Idalie\u2019s fair, transparent frame; and the one\r\ntrembling, shining star of evening that palpitates responsively to happy\r\nlovers, never seemed more divine or more beloved than she did to\r\nLadislas, as she sat there, now fixing a timid but attentive gaze upon\r\nhis countenance, and then dropping it upon the paper before her. And not\r\nalone for Ladislas was this hour the dawn of passionate love. The same\r\nspell was felt in the heart of Idalie. One moment their eyes met and\r\nglanced upon each other, the look of exalted, eternal love\u2014mute,\r\nblessed, and inexpressible. Their lids fell and were raised no more.\r\nRapture thrilled their breasts and swelled their full hearts; for,\r\nmotionless, and in deep silence, as if every outward faculty were\r\nabsorbed in reverence, they continued, each inwardly knowing, hearing,\r\nseeing nothing but the divine influence and attraction of the other.\r\n\r\nI know not if the portrait was finished. I believe it was not.\r\nNoiselessly Idalie arose and departed to seek the Princess, and Ladislas\r\nfollowed. \u201cWho is that lovely being!\u201d inquired an English traveller some\r\ntime afterward, pointing out Idalie from a group of ladies.\r\n\r\n\u201cA Polish girl\u2014a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of mine,\u201d was the reply of the Princess; \u201ca\r\ndaughter of one of Kosciusko\u2019s unfortunate followers, who died here,\r\npoor and unknown. She has a great genius for drawing and painting, but\r\nshe is so different in her nature from the generality of people, that I\r\nam afraid she will never get on in the world. All the family are wild\r\nand strange. There is a brother who they say is a complete ruffian;\r\nbrave as a Pole and as unprincipled as an Italian! a villain quite\r\nvarnished in picturesque, like one of your Lord Byron\u2019s corsairs and\r\ngiaours. Then there is a younger sister; the most uncontrollable little\r\ncreature, who chose to pretend my house was insupportable, and ran away\r\ninto Calabria or Campagna, and set up as a _prima donna_. But these, to\r\nbe sure, are the children of a second wife, an Italian; and Idalie, I\r\nmust confess, has none of their lawlessness, but is remarkably gentle\r\nand steady.\u201d\r\n\r\nDisgusted with this heartless conversation, which disturbed his ecstasy,\r\nLadislas hastily quitted the Dashkhoff palace, and entered the Villa\r\nReale, whose embowering trees promised solitude. Not one straggler of\r\nthe gay crowds that frequent this luxurious garden from morning till\r\nmidnight was now to be seen. With its straight walks buried in gloom and\r\nshadow; its stone fonts of sleeping water; its marble statues, its\r\nheaven-pointing obelisks, and its midnight air, it was silent as a\r\ndeserted oratory, when the last strain of the vesper hymn has died away,\r\nthe last taper has ceased to burn, the last censer has been flung, and\r\nboth priests and worshippers have departed. Ladislas cast himself upon a\r\nstone seat in the ilex grove that skirts the margin of the bay. \u201cI\r\ndreamt not of love,\u201d he exclaimed; \u201cI sought her not! I had renounced\r\nlife and all its train of raptures, hopes, and joys. Cold, and void of\r\nevery wish, the shadow of death lay upon my heart; suddenly she stood\r\nbefore me, lovely as an angel that heralds departed spirits to the\r\nkingdom of eternal bliss. Fearless, but mild, she poured the magic of\r\nher gaze upon my soul. I speak the word of the hour. She shall be\r\nmine\u2014or I will die!\u201d\r\n\r\nReclining in the ilex grove, Ladislas passed the remaining hours of that\r\ntoo short night, entranced in bliss, as if the bright form of his\r\nbeloved were still shining beside him. Gradually every beauty of the\r\nwondrous and far-famed Bay of Naples impressed itself upon his\r\nattention. The broad and beamless moon sinking behind the tall elms of\r\nPosilippo; the broken starlight on the surface of the waves\u2014their\r\nrippling sound as they broke at his feet; Sorrento\u2019s purple promontory,\r\nand the gentle wind that blew from it; the solitary grandeur of Capri\u2019s\r\nmountain-island rising out of the middle of the bay, a colossal sphinx\r\nguarding two baths of azure light; Vesuvius breathing its smoke, and\r\nflame, and sparks, in the cloudless ether;\u2014all became mingled in\r\ninexplicable harmony with his new-born passion, and were indelibly\r\nassociated with his recollection of that night.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Idalie was sketching in the Villa Reale. She had seated\r\nherself on the outside of a shady alley. Two persons passed behind her,\r\nand the childish petulant voice of one of them drew her attention. That\r\nvoice, so sweet even in its impatience, certainly belonged to her\r\nfugitive sister. \u201cIt is she!\u201d exclaimed Idalie, gliding swift as thought\r\nbetween the trees, and folding the speaker to her bosom. \u201cMarietta\u2014my\r\ndear little Marietta! at last you are come back again. _Cattivella!_ now\r\npromise to stay with me. You know not how miserable I have been about\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! I cannot promise anything of the kind,\u201d replied Marietta, playing\r\nwith the ribands of her guitar. \u201cI choose to have my liberty.\u201d\r\n\r\nIdalie\u2019s arms sunk, and her eyes were cast upon the ground when she\r\nheard the cold and decided tone in which this refusal was pronounced. On\r\nraising the latter, they glanced upon the companion of her sister, and\r\nwere filled with unconquerable emotion at discovering Ladislas, the\r\nelected of her heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cI met your sister here a few minutes ago,\u201d explained he, partaking her\r\nfeelings; \u201cand having been so fortunate the other day as to render her a\r\nslight service\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d interrupted Marietta; \u201cI sung for him a whole evening at\r\nGaeta. It was a curious adventure. His carriage was overturned close to\r\nthe inn. I had arrived there half an hour before, and was walking in an\r\norange grove near the spot, and saw the accident happen, and heard him\r\nspeak in Polish to his servant. My heart beat with joy. He looked\r\nwondrous melancholy. I thought it must be about his country, so I crept\r\nas softly as a mouse among the trees under his balcony, and sung him a\r\nsalve-song in Polish. I improvised it on the spur of the moment. I do\r\nnot very well recollect it, but it was about azure heavens, southern\r\nwinds, myrtle and lemon blossoms, and the illustrious unfortunate; and\r\nit ought to have pleased him. Just as I had finished, out starts our\r\nblessed brother, Giorgio, from the inn, and began one of his most\r\nterrific bothers. Imagine how frightened I was, for I thought he was\r\ngone to Sicily with his regiment. However, they got him away, and I\r\nfollowed this stranger into his room, and sang to him the rest of the\r\nevening. All my best songs,\u2014the \u2018Mio ben quando verr\u00e0,\u2019 \u2018Nina pazza per\r\nAmore,\u2019 the \u2018All\u2019 armi\u2019 of Generali; the \u2018Dolce cara patria,\u2019 from\r\n_Tancredi_; the \u2018Deh calma,\u2019 from _Otello_,\u2014all my whole stock I assure\r\nyou.\u201d Thus rattled on Marietta; and then, as if her quick eye had\r\nalready discovered the secret of their attachment, she added, with an\r\narch smile, \u201cbut don\u2019t be frightened, Idalie, though his eyes filled\r\nwith tears whilst I sung, as yours often do, not a word of praise did\r\nthe Sarmatian bestow on me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen return and live with me, dear Marietta, and I will praise you as\r\nmuch, and more than you desire.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Santa Maria del Pi\u00ea di Grotta!_ What a tiresome person you are,\r\nIdalie. When you have got an idea into your head, an earthquake would\r\nnot get it out again. Have I not told you that I will not. If you knew\r\nthe motive you would approve my resolution. I said I liked my liberty,\r\nand so forth; but that was not the reason of my flight. I do not choose\r\nto have anything to do with Giorgio and the Princess; for, believe me,\r\ndearest Idalie, disgraceful as my present mode of life seems to you, it\r\nis innocence itself compared with the crimes they were leading me into.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome suspicion of this did once cross my mind,\u201d her sister replied with\r\na sigh, \u201cbut I rejected it as too horrible. Dear child, think no more\r\nabout them. Do you not know that I have left the Princess\u2019 house, and am\r\nliving by myself in a little pavilion far up on the Strada Nuova. There\r\nyou need not fear their molestations.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs not Giorgio then with you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; I have not seen him for some time. I doubt if he be in Naples.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo Messer Giorgio, you have deceived me again. But I might have known\r\nthat, for he never speaks a word of truth. Be assured, however, he is in\r\nNaples, for I caught a glimpse of him this morning, mounting the hill\r\nthat leads to the barracks at Pizzofalcone, and he is as intimate with\r\nthe Princess as ever, though she pretends to disown him. As for me, I am\r\nengaged at San Carlos; the writing is signed and sealed, and cannot be\r\nbroken without forfeiting a heavy sum of money; otherwise I should be\r\nhappy to live peacefully with you; for you know not, Idalie, all I have\r\nhad to suffer; how sad and ill-treated I have been! how often pinched\r\nwith want and hunger; and worse than that, when Giorgio takes it into\r\nhis head to pursue me, and plants himself in the pit, fixing his\r\nhorrible looks upon me as I sing! how many times I have rushed out of\r\nthe theatre, and spent the nights in the great wide Maremma, beset by\r\nrobbers, buffaloes, and wild boars, till I was almost mad with fear and\r\nbewilderment. There is a curse upon our family, I think. Did not our\r\nfather once live in a splendid castle of his own, with a hundred\r\nretainers to wait upon him; and do you remember the miserable garret in\r\nwhich he died? But I cannot stay any longer. I am wanted at the\r\nrehearsal: so, farewell, dearest Idalie. Be you at least happy, and\r\nleave me to fulfil the evil destiny that hangs over our race.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! no!\u201d exclaimed Ladislas, \u201cthat must not be\u2014the writing must be\r\ncancelled,\u201d\u2014and then, with the affection and unreserve of a brother, he\r\nentered into their sentiments; with sweet and persuasive arguments\r\novercame their scruples of receiving a pecuniary obligation from him;\r\nand finally, taking Marietta by the hand, led her away to San Carlos, in\r\norder to cancel her engagement.\r\n\r\nAnd in another hour it was cancelled. Marietta was once more free and\r\njoyful; and, affectionate as old friends, the three met again in the\r\nlittle pavilion, which was Idalie\u2019s home. It stood alone in a myrtle\r\nwood on the last of the green promontories which form the Strada Nuova,\r\nand separate the Bay of Naples from the Bay of Baia,\u2014a lonely hermitage\r\nsecluded from the noise and turmoil of the city, whose only visitors\r\nwere the faint winds of morning and evening, the smiles of the fair\r\nItalian heaven, its wandering clouds, and, perchance, a solitary bird.\r\nFrom every part of the building you could see the Baian Ocean sparkling\r\nbreathlessly beneath the sun; through the windows and the columns of the\r\nportico you beheld the mountains of the distant coast shining on, hour\r\nafter hour, like amethysts in a thrilling vapour of purple transparent\r\nlight, so ardent yet halcyon, so bright and unreal, a poet would have\r\nchosen it to emblem the radiant atmosphere that glows around elysian\r\nisles of eternal peace and joy. Marietta soon left the building to join\r\nsome fisher boys who were dancing the tarantella upon the beach below.\r\nIdalie took her drawing, which was her daily employment, and furnished\r\nher the means of subsistence, and Ladislas sat by her side. There was no\r\nsound of rolling carriages, no tramp of men and horse, no distant\r\nsinging, no one speaking near; the wind awoke no rustling amid the\r\nleaves of the myrtle wood, and the wave died without a murmur on the\r\nshore. Ladislas\u2019 deep but melodious voice alone broke the crystal\r\nsilence of the noonday air. Italy was around him, robed in two\r\nsplendours of blue and green; but he was an exile, and the recollections\r\nof his native land thronged into his memory. During the three months it\r\nhad taken him to effect his escape from Warsaw to Naples, his lips had\r\nbeen closed in silence, whilst his mind had been wrapt in the gloom of\r\nthe dreadful images that haunted it. In Idalie\u2019s countenance there was\r\nthat expression of innocence and sublimity of soul, of purity and\r\nstrength, that excited the warmest admiration, and inspired sudden and\r\ndeep confidence. She looked like some supernatural being that walks\r\nthrough the world, untouched by its corruptions; like one that\r\nunconsciously, yet with delight, confers pleasure and peace; and\r\nLadislas felt that, in speaking to her of the dark sorrows of his\r\ncountry, they would lose their mortal weight and be resolved into\r\nbeauty, by her sympathy. In glowing terms he described the heroic\r\nstruggle of Poland for liberty; the triumph and exultation that had\r\nfilled every bosom during the few months they were free; the hardships\r\nand privations they had endured, the deeds of daring bravery of the men,\r\nthe heroism it had awakened in the women; and then its fall\u2014the return\r\nof the Russians; the horrible character of Russian despotism, its\r\nsternness and deceit, its pride and selfish ignorance; the loss of\r\npublic and private integrity, the disbelief of good, the blighted,\r\nhopeless, joyless life endured by those whom it crushes beneath its\r\nservitude.\r\n\r\nThus passed the hours of the forenoon. Then Ladislas fixing his eyes\r\nupon the coast of Baia, and expressing at the same time his impatience\r\nto visit that ancient resort of heroes and of emperors, Idalie led the\r\nway by a small path down the hill to the beach. There they found a\r\nskiff, and, unmooring it from its rocky haven, embarked in it. It had\r\nbeen sweet to mark the passage of that light bark freighted with these\r\nhappy lovers, when borne by its sails it swept through the little\r\nocean-channel that lies between the beaked promontories of the mainland\r\nand the closing cliffs of the island of Nisida; and when with gentler\r\nmotion it glided into the open expanse of the Bay of Baia, and cut its\r\nway through the translucent water, above the ruins of temples and\r\npalaces overgrown by seaweed, on which the rays of the sun were playing,\r\ncreating a thousand rainbow hues, that varied with every wave that\r\nflowed over them. In all that plane of blue light it was the only moving\r\nthing; and as if it had been the child of the ocean that bore it, and\r\nthe sun that looked down on it, it sped gaily along in their smiles past\r\nthe fortress where Brutus and Cassius sought shelter after the death of\r\nC\u00e6sar; past the temples of Jupiter and Neptune; by the ruins of that\r\ncastle in which three Romans once portioned out the world between them,\r\nto the Cumean hill that enshadows the beloved Linternum of Scipio\r\nAfricanus, and in which he died. The whole of this coast is a paradise\r\nof natural beauty, investing with its own loveliness the time-eaten\r\nwrecks with which it is strewn; the mouldering past is mingled with the\r\nvivid present; ruin and grey annihilation are decked in eternal spring.\r\nThe woody windings of the shore reveal, in their deep recesses, the\r\ngleaming marble fragments of the abodes of ancient heroes; the verdurous\r\nhues of the promontories mingle with the upright columns of shattered\r\ntemples, or clothe, with nature\u2019s voluptuous bloom, the pale funereal\r\nurns of departed gods; whilst the foliage and the inland fountains, and\r\nthe breaking waves upon the shore, were murmuring around their woven\r\nminstrelsy of love and joy. Earth, sea, and sky blazed like three gods,\r\nwith tranquil but animated loveliness; with a splendour that did not\r\ndazzle\u2014with a richness that could not satiate. The air on that beautiful\r\nwarm coast was as a field of fragrance; the refreshing sea-breeze seemed\r\nto blow from Paradise, quickening the senses, and bringing to them the\r\nodour of a thousand unknown blossoms. \u201cWhat world is this?\u201d exclaimed\r\nLadislas in a tone of rapture that nearly answered its own question. \u201cI\r\ncould imagine I had entered an enchanted garden; four heavens surround\r\nme,\u2014the one above; the pure element beneath me with its waves that shine\r\nand tremble as stars; the adorned earth that hangs over it; and the\r\nheaven of delight they create within my breast. \u2018Morning is here a rose,\r\nday a tulip, night a lily; evening is, like morning, again a rose, and\r\nlife seems a choral-hymn of beautiful and glowing sentiments, that I go\r\nsinging to myself as I wander along this perpetual path of flowers.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was night ere they again reached the pavilion. It stood dark and\r\ndeserted in the clear moonshine; the door was locked. After calling and\r\nknocking repeatedly without obtaining any answer, it became evident that\r\nMarietta had quitted the dwelling. In the first moment of surprise which\r\nthis occurrence occasioned, they had not observed a written sheet of\r\npaper, of a large size, which lay unfolded and placed directly before\r\nthe door, as if to attract attention. Idalie took it up and read the\r\nfollowing lines, traced by Marietta:\u2014\r\n\r\n    \u201cOh, Idalie! but a few hours ago, how calm and secure we were in\r\n    happiness\u2014now danger and perhaps destruction is our portion. One\r\n    chance yet remains; the moment you get this, persuade\u2014not only\r\n    persuade\u2014but compel that adorable stranger to fly instantly from\r\n    Naples. He is not safe here an instant longer. Do not doubt what I\r\n    say, or his life may be the forfeit. How can I impress this on your\r\n    mind? I would not willingly betray any one, but how else can I save\r\n    him? Giorgio has been here. Oh! the frightful violence of that man.\r\n    He raved like an insane person, and let fall such dark and bloody\r\n    hints as opened worlds of horror to me. I am gone to discover what I\r\n    can. I know his haunts, and his associates, and shall soon find out\r\n    if there be any truth in what he threatens. I could not await your\r\n    return, neither dare I leave the pavilion open. Who knows if, in the\r\n    interval between my departure and your return, an assassin might not\r\n    conceal himself within; and your first welcome be, to see the\r\n    stranger fall lifeless at your feet. His every step is watched by\r\n    spies armed for his destruction. I know not what to do\u2014and yet it\r\n    seems to me that my going may possibly avert the catastrophe.\u201d\r\n\r\n                                                              \u201cMARIETTA\u201d\r\n\r\nLadislas listened to these lines unmoved; but the effect they produced\r\non Idalie was dreadful. She gave implicit credence to them, and every\r\nword sounded as a knell. She lost all presence of mind; every reflection\r\nthat might have taught her to avert the stroke she so much dreaded, was\r\nswallowed up in anguish, as if the deed that was to be consummated were\r\nalready done. What task can be more difficult than to describe the\r\noverwhelming agony which heavy and unexpected misery produces. To have\r\nlived the day that Idalie had just lived\u2014a day in which all the beauty\r\nof existence had been unveiled to its very depths; to have dreamt, as\r\nshe had done, a dream of love that steeped her soul in divine and almost\r\nuncommunicable joy; and now to sink from this pinnacle of happiness into\r\na black and lampless cavern, the habitation of death, whose spectral\r\nform and chilling spirit was felt through all the air! This is but a\r\nfeeble metaphor of the sudden transition from rapture to misery which\r\nIdalie experienced. She looked upon Ladislas, and beheld him bright and\r\nfull of life; the roseate hues of health upon his cheek, his eyes\r\nbeaming with peaceful joy, his noble countenance varying not in the\r\nleast from that imperturbable self-possession which was its habitual\r\nexpression. And as her imagination made present to her the fatal moment,\r\nwhen beneath the dagger of the assassin this adored being should sink\r\nbleeding, wounded, and then be for ever lost in death, her blood rushed\r\nto her heart, a deadly pause ensued, from which she awoke in a\r\nbewildering mist of horror. Ladislas beheld her excess of emotion with\r\npain, in which, however, all was not pain, for it was blended with that\r\ntriumphant exultation that a lover ever feels when he for the first time\r\nbecomes assured that he is beloved by the object of his love with an\r\naffection tender and intense as his own.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Idalie recovered some presence of mind, with passionate\r\nsupplications she entreated Ladislas to leave her, to fly this solitary\r\nspot, and to seek safety amid the crowded streets of Naples. He would\r\nnot hear of this; he gently remonstrated with her upon the\r\nunreasonableness of her terrors, urging how little probable it was that\r\nhis passing _rencontre_ with Giorgio at Gaeta could have awakened in him\r\nsuch a deadly spirit of revenge as Marietta represented. He viewed the\r\nwhole thing lightly, attributing it either to the vivacity of Marietta\u2019s\r\nimagination, which had made her attach a monstrous import to some angry\r\nexpressions of her brother, or looking upon it as a merry device which\r\nshe had contrived in order to frighten them; and tranquillized Idalie by\r\nassurances that they would shortly see her wild sister return laughing,\r\nand full of glee at the success of her plot. In this expectation two\r\nhours passed away, but still no Marietta appeared, and it had grown too\r\nlate to seek another shelter without exposing Idalie to the slander of\r\nevil-minded people. They passed the rest of the night therefore in the\r\nportico, Idalie sometimes pale and breathless, with recurring fears, and\r\nsometimes calm and happy, as Ladislas poured forth his tale of\r\npassionate love. His feelings, on the contrary, were pure and unalloyed.\r\nWhere Idalie was, there was the whole universe to him; where she was\r\nnot, there was only a formless void. He had an insatiable thirst for her\r\npresence, which only grew intenser with the enjoyment of its own desire;\r\nand he blessed the fortunate occurrence that prolonged his bliss during\r\nhours which otherwise would have been spent pining in absence from her.\r\nNo other considerations intruded. Blessings kindled within his eyes as\r\nhe gazed upon that lovely countenance and faultless form, and angels\r\nmight have envied his happiness.\r\n\r\nMorning came, bright and serene; the sun arose, the ocean and the\r\nmountains again resumed their magic splendour; the myrtle woods and\r\nevery minuter bloom of the garden shone out beneath the sun, and the\r\nwhole earth was a happy form made perfect by the power of light. They\r\nrecollected that they had promised to join the Princess Dashkhoff, and a\r\nlarge party of her friends, at eight o\u2019clock, in an excursion to P\u00e6stum.\r\nThe point of meeting was the shore of the Villa Reale, where the\r\nnumerous guests were to embark in a steamer which had been engaged for\r\nthe occasion. In Idalie\u2019s present homeless and uncertain condition, this\r\nplan offered some advantages. It would enable them to pass the day in\r\neach other\u2019s society under the auspices of the Princess, and it was to\r\nbe hoped that on their return the mystery of Marietta\u2019s disappearance\r\nwould be unravelled, and Idalie find her home once more open to her.\r\nThey had scarcely settled to go, ere one of those horse calessini which\r\nply in the streets of Naples was seen coming towards them. Its driver, a\r\nragged boy, sat on the shaft, singing as he drove; another urchin, all\r\nin tatters, stood as lacquey behind, and between them sat Marietta; the\r\npaleness of fear was on her cheeks, and her eyes had the staggered,\r\naffrighted look of one who has gazed upon some appalling horror. She\r\nhastily descended, and bade the calessino retire to some distance, and\r\nawait further orders.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy is he yet here?\u201d said she to her sister. \u201cYou foolish, blind\r\nIdalie, why did you not mind my letter?\u2014too proud, I suppose, to obey\r\nany but yourself; but mark, you would not hear my warnings\u2014we shall lose\r\nhim, and you will feel them in your heart\u2019s core.\u201d She then, with all\r\nthe violent gesticulation of an Italian, threw herself at the feet of\r\nLadislas, and with a countenance that expressed her own full conviction\r\nin what she said, besought him to fly instantly, not only from Naples,\r\nbut from Italy, for his life would never be safe in that land of\r\nassassins and traitors. With entreaties almost as violent as her own,\r\nLadislas and Idalie urged her to explain, but this only threw her into a\r\nnew frenzy; she declared the peril was too urgent to admit of\r\nexplanation\u2014every moment was precious\u2014another hour\u2019s stay in Naples\r\nwould be his death.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Ladislas was a curious one. He had served in the\r\nRussian campaigns against Persia and Turkey, and had been there daily\r\nexposed to the chances of destruction; in the late struggle between\r\nPoland and Russia, he had performed actions of such determined and\r\ndaring bravery as had made his name a glory to his countrymen, and a\r\nterror to their enemies. In all these exploits he had devoted himself so\r\nunreservedly to death, that his escape was considered as a miraculous\r\ninterposition of Heaven. It was not to be expected that this Mars in a\r\nhuman form, this Achilles who had braved death in a thousand shapes,\r\nshould now consent to fly before the uplifted finger and visionary\r\nwarnings of a dream-sick girl; for such Marietta appeared to him to be.\r\nHe pitied her sufferings, endeavoured to soothe her, but asserted he had\r\nseen no reason that could induce him to quit Naples.\r\n\r\nA full quarter of an hour elapsed before an explanation could be wrung\r\nfrom Marietta. The chaos that reigned in her mind may easily be\r\nimagined. She had become possessed of a secret which involved the life\r\nof two persons. Ladislas refused to save himself unless she revealed\r\nwhat might place her brother\u2019s life in jeopardy. Whichever way she\r\nlooked, destruction closed the view. Nature had bestowed on her a heart\r\nexquisitely alive to the sufferings of others, a mind quick in\r\nperceiving the nicest lines of moral rectitude, and strenuous in\r\nendeavouring to act up to its perceptions. Any deviations in her conduct\r\nfrom these principles had been the work of a fate that, strong and\r\nfierce as a tempest, had bent down her weak youth like a reed beneath\r\nits force. She had once loved Giorgio; he had played with and caressed\r\nher in infancy\u2014with the fond patronage of an elder brother had procured\r\nher the only indulgences her orphaned childhood had ever known.\r\nFraternal love called loudly on her not to endanger his life; gratitude\r\nas loudly called on her not to allow her benefactor to become his\r\nvictim. This last idea was too horrible to be endured. The present\r\nmoment is ever all-powerful with the young, and Marietta related what\r\nshe knew.\r\n\r\nWell might the poor child be wild and disordered. She had passed the\r\nnight in the catacombs of San Gennaro, under Capo di Monte. In these\r\nsubterranean galleries were held the nightly meetings of the band of\r\ndesperate _bravi_ of whom Giorgio was in secret the chief. The entrance\r\nto the catacombs is in a deserted vineyard, and is overgrown by huge\r\naloes; rooted in stones and sharp rocks, they lift their thorny leaves\r\nabove the opening, and conceal it effectually. A solitary fig-tree that\r\ngrows near renders the spot easily recognisable by those already\r\nacquainted with the secret. The catacombs themselves are wide winding\r\ncaves, the burial-place of the dead of past ages. Piles of human bones,\r\nwhite and bleached by time, are heaped along the rocky sides of these\r\ncaverns. In one of these walks, whilst they were friends, Giorgio had\r\nshown the place to Marietta. In those days he feared not to entrust his\r\nmysterious way of life to her; for although in all common concerns she\r\nwas wild and untractable, yet in all that touched the interests of those\r\nfew whom she loved, Marietta was silent and reserved as Epicharis\r\nherself. The menaces Giorgio let fall in his visit on the preceding\r\nforenoon had excited her highest alarm, and she determined, at any risk,\r\nto learn the extent of the danger that hung over the stranger. After\r\nwaiting in vain for Idalie\u2019s return till the close of evening, she had\r\nhastened to Capo di Monte, entered the catacombs alone, and, concealed\r\nbehind a pile of bones, had awaited the arrival of the confederates.\r\nThey assembled at midnight. Their first subject of consultation was the\r\nstranger. Giorgio acquainted them with his history, which he told them\r\nhad been communicated to him that very morning by a Russian lady of high\r\nrank, who had likewise charged him with the business he had to unfold to\r\nthem. He described Ladislas as a fugitive, unprotected by any\r\nGovernment; he bore about his person certain papers which had been found\r\nin the palace of Warsaw, and were the confidential communications of the\r\nRussian Autocrat to his brother the Viceroy of Poland, and were of such\r\na nature as to rouse all Europe against their writer. These papers had\r\nbeen entrusted to Ladislas, whose intention was to proceed to Paris and\r\npublish them there. Private business, however, of the greatest\r\nimportance, had forced him to visit Naples first. The Russian Government\r\nhad traced him to Naples, and had empowered a certain Russian lady to\r\ntake any step, or go any lengths, in order to obtain these papers from\r\nLadislas. This lady had made Giorgio her emissary; her name he carefully\r\nconcealed, but Marietta averred, from his description, that it could be\r\nno other than the Princess Dashkhoff. After much consulting among the\r\nband, the assassination of the Pole had been decided upon. This seemed\r\nto be the only sure method; for he carried the papers ever about his\r\nperson, was distinguished for his bravery, and if openly attacked would\r\nresist to the last. Giorgio was no stickler in the means he employed,\r\nand told his companions he had the less reason to be so in this case, as\r\nhe had received assurances from the highest quarter that his crime\r\nshould go unpunished, and the reward be enormous. Ladislas was almost\r\nunknown in Naples; the Government would not interest itself for a\r\nfugitive, without passport, country or name; and what friends had he\r\nhere to inquire into the circumstances of his destruction, or to\r\ninterest themselves to avenge it?\r\n\r\nSuch was Marietta\u2019s tale, and Ladislas instantly acknowledged the\r\nnecessity of flight. He was too well acquainted with Russian perfidy to\r\ndoubt that even a lady of a rank so distinguished as the Princess\r\nDashkhoff might be induced to undertake as foul a task as that\r\nattributed to her by Marietta. The worldly and artificial manners of\r\nthis lady, in an Italian or a French-woman, would only have resulted\r\nfrom habits of intrigue; but a Russian, unaccustomed to look on human\r\nlife as sacred, taught by the Government of her own country that cruelty\r\nand treachery are venial offences, wholly destitute of a sense of\r\nhonour, concealed, under such an exterior, vices the most odious, and a\r\ncallousness to guilt unknown in more civilised lands. Ladislas knew\r\nthis; and he knew that the badness of the Neapolitan Government afforded\r\nscope for crime, which could not exist elsewhere; and he felt that on\r\nevery account it were better to withdraw himself immediately from the\r\nscene of danger.\r\n\r\nWhile musing on these things, Idalie\u2019s beseeching eyes were eloquent in\r\nimploring him to fly. He consented; but a condition was annexed to his\r\nconsent, that Idalie should share his flight. He urged his suit with\r\nfervour. It were easy for them on a very brief notice to seek the young\r\nlady\u2019s confessor, induce him to bestow on them the nuptial benediction,\r\nand thus to sanctify their departure together. Marietta seconded the\r\nlover\u2019s entreaties, and Idalie, blushing and confused, could only\r\nreply,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMy accompanying you would but increase your danger, and facilitate the\r\nbravo\u2019s means of tracing you. How could I get a passport? How leave this\r\nplace?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have a plan for all,\u201d replied Ladislas; and he then related that the\r\n_Sully_ steam-packet lay in the harbour of Naples, ready to sail on the\r\nshortest notice; he would engage that for their conveyance, and so\r\nspeedily bid adieu to the shores of Naples, and all its perils.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut that boat,\u201d exclaimed Idalie, \u201cis the very one engaged by the\r\nPrincess for the excursion to P\u00e6stum.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis, for a time, seemed to disarrange their schemes, but they\r\nconsidered that no danger could happen to Ladislas while one of a party\r\nof pleasure with the Princess, who from this act of his would be quite\r\nunsuspicious of his intended departure. At night, upon their return from\r\nP\u00e6stum, when the rest of the party should have disembarked at Naples,\r\nLadislas and Idalie would remain on board, and the vessel immediately\r\ncommence its voyage for France. This plan thus assumed a very feasible\r\nappearance, while Ladislas, in accents of fond reproach, asked Idalie\r\nwherefore she refused to share his fortunes, and accompany him in his\r\njourney; and Marietta, clapping her hands exclaimed, \u201cShe consents! she\r\nconsents! Do not ask any more, she has already yielded. We will all\r\nreturn to Naples. Ladislas shall go immediately to seek out the captain\r\nof the _Sully_, and arrange all with him; while, without loss of time,\r\nwe will proceed to the convent of Father Basil, and get everything ready\r\nby the time Ladislas shall join us, which must be with as much speed as\r\nhe can contrive.\u201d\r\n\r\nIdalie silently acquiesced in this arrangement, and Ladislas kissed her\r\nhand with warm and overflowing gratitude. They now contrived to stow\r\nthemselves in the little calessino, and as they proceeded on their way,\r\nLadislas said: \u201cWe seem to have forgotten the future destiny of our dear\r\nMarietta all this time. The friendless condition in which we shall leave\r\nher fills me with anxiety. She is the preserver of my life, and we are\r\nboth under the deepest obligations to her. What shall you do, Marietta,\r\nwhen we are gone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFear not for me,\u201d exclaimed the wild girl; \u201cit is necessary I should\r\nremain behind to arrange those things which Idalie\u2019s sudden departure\r\nwill leave in sad disorder; but you will see me soon in Paris, for how\r\ncan I exist apart from my sister?\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen near to Naples, Ladislas alighted from the calessino, and directed\r\nhis steps towards the port, while the fair girls proceeded on their way\r\nto the convent. What the bashful, conscious Idalie would have done\r\nwithout her sister\u2019s help, it is difficult to guess. Marietta busied\r\nherself about all; won over the priest to the sudden marriage, contrived\r\nto put up articles of dress for the fair bride\u2019s journey, and thinking\r\nof everything, seemed the guardian angel of the lovers. Ladislas arrived\r\nat the convent; he had been successful with the master of the\r\nsteam-packet, and all was prepared. Marietta heard this from his own\r\nlips, and carried the happy news to Idalie. He did not see her till they\r\nmet at the altar, where, kneeling before the venerable priest, they were\r\nunited for ever. And now time, as it sped on, gave them no moment to\r\nindulge their various and overpowering feelings. Idalie embraced her\r\nsister again and again, and entreating her to join them speedily in\r\nParis, made her promise to write, and then, escorted by her husband,\r\nproceeded to the _Sully_, on board of which most of the party were\r\nalready assembled.\r\n\r\nThe steamer proceeded on its course. Farewell to Naples!\u2014that elysian\r\ncity, as the poet justly calls it; that favourite of sea and land and\r\nsky. The hills that surround it smooth their rugged summits, and descend\r\ninto gentle slopes and opening defiles, to receive its buildings and\r\nhabitations. Temples, domes, and marble palaces are ranged round the\r\ncrescent form of the bay, and above them arise dark masses, and wooded\r\nclefts, and fair gardens, whose trees are ever vernal. Before it the\r\nmighty sea binds its wild streams, and smoothes them into gentlest\r\nwaves, as they kiss the silver, pebbly shore, and linger with dulcet\r\nmurmur around the deep-based promontories. The sky\u2014who has not heard of\r\nthe Italian sky?\u2014one intense diffusion, one serene omnipresence, for\r\never smiling above the boundless sea, and for ever bending in azure\r\nmirth over the flowing outlines of the distant mountains.\r\n\r\nThey first passed Castel-a-Mare, and then the abrupt promontories on\r\nwhich Sorrento and ancient Amalfi are situated. The sublimity and\r\nintense loveliness of the scene wrapt in delight each bosom. The hills,\r\ncovered with ilex, dark laurel, and bright-leaved myrtle, were mirrored\r\nin the pellucid waves, which the lower branches caressed and kissed as\r\nthe winds waved them. Behind arose other hills, also covered with wood;\r\nand, more distant, forming the grand background, was sketched the huge\r\nridge of lofty Apennines. Still proceeding on their way to P\u00e6stum, they\r\nexchanged the rocky beach for a low and dreary shore. The dusky\r\nmountains retired inland, and leaving a waste\u2014the abode of malaria, and\r\nthe haunt of robbers\u2014the landscape assumed a gloomy magnificence, in\r\nplace of the romantic and picturesque loveliness which had before\r\ncharmed their eyes. Ladislas leaned from the side of the vessel, and\r\ngazed upon the beauty of nature with sentiments too disturbed for\r\nhappiness. He was annoyed by the unpropitious presence of the idle and\r\nthe gay. He saw Idalie in the midst of them, and did not even wish to\r\njoin her while thus situated. He shrank into himself, and tried,\r\nforgetting the immediate discomforts of his position, to think only of\r\nthat paradise into which love had led him, to compensate for his\r\npatriotic sorrows. He strove patiently to endure the tedious hours of\r\nthis never-ending day, during which he must play a false part, and see\r\nhis bride engaged by others. While his attention was thus occupied, the\r\nvoice of the Princess Dashkhoff startled him, and, looking up, he\r\nwondered how a face that seemed so bland, and a voice that spoke so\r\nfair, could hide so much wickedness and deceit. As the hours passed on,\r\nhis situation became irksome in the extreme. Once or twice he drew near\r\nIdalie, and tried to disengage her from the crowd; but each time he saw\r\nthe Princess watching him stealthily, while his young bride, with\r\nfeminine prudence, avoided every opportunity of conversing apart with\r\nhim. Ladislas could ill endure this. He began to fancy that he had a\r\nthousand things to say, and that their mutual safety depended on his\r\nbeing able to communicate them to her. He wrote a few lines hastily on\r\nthe back of a letter with a pencil, conjuring her to find some means of\r\naffording him a few minutes\u2019 conversation, and telling her that if this\r\ncould not be done before, he should take occasion, while the rest of the\r\ncompany were otherwise occupied, to steal from them that evening to the\r\nlarger temple, and there await her joining him, for that everything\r\ndepended on his being able to speak to her. He scarcely knew what he\r\nmeant as he wrote this; but, driven by contradiction and impatience, and\r\ndesirous of learning exactly how she meant to conduct herself on the\r\nPrincess\u2019s disembarking at Naples, it seemed to him of the last\r\nimportance that his request should be complied with. He was folding the\r\npaper when the Princess was at his side, and addressed him.\r\n\r\n\u201cA sonnet, Count Ladislas; surely a poetic imagination inspires you; may\r\nI not see it?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd she held out her hand. Taken unaware, Ladislas darted at her a look\r\nwhich made her step back trembling and in surprise. Was she discovered?\r\nThe idea was fraught with terror. But Ladislas, perceiving the\r\nindiscretion of his conduct, masked his sensations with a smile, and\r\nreplied: \u201cThey are words of a Polish song, which I wish Idalie to\r\ntranslate for the amusement of your friends;\u201d and, stepping forward, he\r\ngave Idalie the paper, and made his request. All pressed to know what\r\nthe song was. Idalie glanced at the writing, and, changing colour, was\r\nscarcely able to command her voice to make such an excuse as was\r\nrendered necessary. She said that it required time and thought, and that\r\nshe could not at that moment comply; then crushing the paper between her\r\ntrembling fingers, began confusedly to talk of something else. The\r\ncompany interchanged smiles, but even the Princess only suspected some\r\nlover-like compliment to her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e.\r\n\r\n\u201cNay,\u201d she said, \u201cwe must at least know the subject of these verses.\r\nWhat is it? tell us, I entreat you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTreachery,\u201d said Ladislas, unable to control his feelings. The Princess\r\nbecame ashy pale; all her self-possession fled, and she turned from the\r\nsearching glance of the Pole with sickness of heart.\r\n\r\nThey were now drawing near their destination. Idalie, grasping the\r\npaper, longed to read it before they should reach the shore. She tried\r\nto recede from the party, and Ladislas, watching her movements, in order\r\nto facilitate her designs, entered into conversation with the Princess.\r\nHe had effectually roused her fears and her curiosity; and she eagerly\r\nseized the opportunity which he offered her of conversing with him,\r\nendeavouring to find out whether he indeed suspected anything, or\r\nwhether her own guilty conscience suggested the alarm with which his\r\nstrange expression had filled her. Ladislas thus contrived to engross\r\nher entire attention, and led her insensibly towards the stern of the\r\nvessel; and as they leant over its side, and gazed on the waters\r\nbeneath, Idalie was effectually relieved from all observation. She now\r\ndisengaged herself from the rest of the party, and, walking forward,\r\nread the lines pencilled by Ladislas. Then, terrified by the secret they\r\ncontained, she tore the paper, as if fearful that its contents might be\r\nguessed, and was about to throw the fragments into the sea, when she\r\nperceived the position of the Princess and Ladislas, and was aware that\r\nthe lady\u2019s quick eye would soon discern the floating scraps as the boat\r\npassed on. Idalie feared the least shadow of danger, so she retreated\r\nfrom the vessel\u2019s side, but still anxious to get rid of the perilous\r\npapers, she determined to throw them into the hold. She approached it,\r\nand looked down. Had the form of a serpent met her eye, she had not been\r\nmore horror-struck. A shriek hovered on her lips, but with a strong\r\neffort she repressed it, and, staggering on, leant against the mast,\r\ntrembling and aghast. She could not be deceived; it was Giorgio\u2019s dark\r\nand scowling eye that she had encountered\u2014his sinister countenance,\r\nupturned, could not be mistaken. Was danger, then, so near, so pressing,\r\nor so inevitable? How could she convey the fatal intelligence to her\r\nhusband, and put him on his guard? She remembered his written request,\r\nwith which she had previously determined in prudence not to comply. But\r\nit would now afford her an opportunity, should no other offer, of\r\ninforming him whom she had seen.\r\n\r\nThus perfidy, hate, and fear possessed the hearts of these human beings,\r\nwho, had a cursory observer seen them as they glided over that sea of\r\nbeauty, beneath the azure heaven, along that enchanted shore, attended\r\nby every luxury, waited on by every obvious blessing of life\u2014he would\r\nhave imagined that they had been selected from the world for the\r\nenjoyment of perfect happiness. But sunny sky and laughing sea appeared\r\nto Idalie only as the haunt and resort of tigers and serpents; a dark\r\nmist seemed to blot the splendour of the sky, as the guilty souls of her\r\nfellow-creatures cast their deforming shadows over its brightness.\r\n\r\nThey had now arrived close on the low shore, and horses and two or three\r\nlight open carriages were at the water\u2019s edge to convey them to the\r\ntemples. They landed. Ladislas presented himself to hand Idalie across\r\nthe plank from the vessel to the beach. \u201cYes?\u201d\u2014he asked her in a voice\r\nof entreaty, as he pressed her hand. She softly returned the pressure,\r\nand the word \u201cBeware\u201d trembled on her lips, when the young Englishman\r\nwho had before admired her, and had endeavoured to engross her attention\r\nthe whole day, was again at her side, to tell her that the Princess was\r\nwaiting for her in her carriage, and entreated her not to delay.\r\n\r\nThe party proceeded to where those glorious relics stand, between the\r\nmountains and the sea, rising from the waste and barren soil, alone on\r\nthe wide and dusky shore. A few sheep grazed at the base of the columns,\r\nand two or three wild-eyed men, clothed in garments of undressed\r\nsheepskin, loitered about. Exclamations of wonder and delight burst from\r\nall, while Ladislas, stealing away to the more distant ruin, gladly\r\nescaped from the crowd, to indulge in lonely reverie. \u201cWhat is man in\r\nhis highest glory?\u201d he thought. \u201cHad we burst the bonds of Poland; and\r\nhad she, in her freedom, emulated the magical achievements of Greece;\r\nnevertheless when time, with insidious serpent windings, had dragged its\r\nlength through a few more centuries, the monuments we had erected would\r\nhave fallen like these, and our monuments\u2014a new P\u00e6stum\u2014have existed\r\nmerely to excite idle wonder and frivolous curiosity!\u201d\r\n\r\nLadislas was certainly in no good-humour while he thus vented his\r\nspleen; but was annoyed by two circumstances, sufficient to irritate a\r\nyoung philosopher: he beheld a scene, whose majestic beauty filled his\r\nsoul with sensibility and awe, in the midst of a crowd of pretenders,\r\nmore intent on the prospect of their picnic dinner, than on regarding\r\nthe glories of art; and he saw his bride, surrounded by strangers,\r\nengrossed by their conversation and flattery, and unable to interchange\r\none word or look of confidence with him. He sighed for the hours passed\r\nunder the portico of Idalie\u2019s solitary pavilion, and the near prospect\r\nof their voyage did not reconcile him to the present; for his soul was\r\ndisturbed by the necessity of interchanging courtesies with his enemy,\r\nand haunted by images of treacherous attempts, from which his valour\r\ncould not protect him.\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that the party should dine at the archbishop\u2019s\r\npalace, and not embark again until ten o\u2019clock, when the moon would\r\nrise. After a couple of hours spent among the ruins, the servants\r\ninformed them that their repast was ready; it was now nearly six\r\no\u2019clock, and after they had dined, more than two hours must elapse\r\nbefore they could depart. Night had fallen on the landscape, and the\r\ndarkness did not invite even the most romantic to wander again among the\r\nruins; the Princess, eager to provide for the amusement of her guests,\r\ncontrived to discover a violin, a flute, and a pipe, and with the\r\nassistance of this music, which in the hands of Italian rustics was as\r\ntrue to time and expression as if Weippert himself had presided, they\r\ncommenced dancing. Idalie\u2019s hand was sought by the Englishman; she\r\nlooked round the room, Ladislas was not there; he had doubtless repaired\r\nto the temple to wait for her, and ignorant of the presence of Giorgio,\r\nwholly unsuspicious, and off his guard, to what dangers might he not be\r\nexposed? Her blood ran cold at the thought; she decidedly refused to\r\ndance, and perceiving the Princess whirling round in a waltz, she\r\nhastily quitted the house, and hurried along over the grass towards the\r\nruins. When she first emerged into the night, the scene seemed wrapped\r\nin impenetrable darkness, but the stars shed their faint rays, and in a\r\nfew moments she began to distinguish objects, and as she drew near the\r\ntemple, she saw a man\u2019s form moving slowly among the columns; she did\r\nnot doubt that it was her husband, wrapped in his cloak, awaiting her.\r\nShe was hurrying towards him, when, leaning against one of the pillars,\r\nshe saw Ladislas himself, and the other, at the same moment, exchanging\r\nhis stealthy pace for a tiger-like spring. She saw a dagger flashing in\r\nhis hand; she darted forward to arrest his arm, and the blow descended\r\non her. With a faint shriek, she fell on the earth, when Ladislas turned\r\nand closed with the assassin; a mortal struggle ensued; already had\r\nLadislas wrested the poignard from his grasp, when the villain drew\r\nanother knife. Ladislas warded off the blow, and plunged his own\r\nstiletto in the bravo\u2019s breast; he fell to earth with a heavy groan, and\r\nthen the silence of the tomb rested on the scene; the white robe of\r\nIdalie, who lay fainting on the ground, directed Ladislas to her side.\r\nHe raised her up in speechless agony, as he beheld the blood which\r\nstained her dress; but by this time she had recovered from her swoon;\r\nshe assured him her wound was slight, that it was nothing; but again\r\nsank into his arms insensible. In a moment his plan was formed; ever\r\neager and impetuous, he executed it ere any second thought could change\r\nit. He had before resolved not to rejoin the party in the archbishop\u2019s\r\npalace, but after his interview with Idalie, to hasten on board the\r\nsteamboat; he had therefore ordered his horse to be saddled, had led it\r\nto the temple, and fastened it to one of the columns. He lifted the\r\nsenseless Idalie carefully in his arms, mounted his horse, and turning\r\nhis steps from the lighted and noisy palace, wound his way to the lonely\r\nshore, where he found the captain and his crew already preparing for\r\ntheir homeward voyage. With their help Idalie was taken on board, and\r\nLadislas gave orders for the instant heaving of the anchor, and their\r\nimmediate departure. The captain asked for the rest of the company.\r\n\u201cThey return by land,\u201d said Ladislas. As he spoke the words, he felt a\r\nslight sensation of remorse, remembering the difficulty they would have\r\nto get there; and how, during the darkness of night, they might fear to\r\nproceed on their journey on a tract of country infested by banditti; but\r\nthe senseless and pale form of Idalie dissipated these thoughts: to\r\narrive at Naples, to procure assistance for her, and then if, as he\r\nhoped, her wound was slight, to continue their voyage before the\r\nPrincess Dashkhoff\u2019s return, were motives too paramount to allow him to\r\nhesitate. The captain of the _Sully_ asked no more questions; the anchor\r\nwas weighed; and in the silver light of the moon, they stood off from\r\nthe shore, and made their swift way back to Naples. They had not gone\r\nfar before the care of Ladislas revived his fair bride. Her wound was in\r\nher arm, and had merely grazed the skin. Terror for her husband, horror\r\nfor the mortal strife which had endangered his life, had caused her to\r\nfaint more than pain or loss of blood. She bound up her own arm; and\r\nthen, as there appeared no necessity for medical aid, Ladislas revoked\r\nhis orders for returning to Naples, but stretching out at once to sea,\r\nthey began their voyage to Marseilles.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, during a pause in the dance, the absence of Ladislas and\r\nIdalie was observed by the feasters in the archbishop\u2019s palace. It\r\nexcited some few sarcasms, which as it continued grow more bitter. The\r\nPrincess Dashkhoff joined in these, and yet she could not repress the\r\ndisquietude of her heart. Had Ladislas alone been absent, her knowledge\r\nof the presence of Giorgio, and his designs, had sufficiently explained\r\nits cause and its duration to her; but that Idalie also should not be\r\nfound might bring a witness to the crime committed, and discover her own\r\nguilty share in the deed of blood perpetrated at her instigation. At\r\nlength the rising of the moon announced the hour when they were to\r\nrepair to the shore. The horses and carriages were brought to the door,\r\nand then it was found that the steed of Ladislas was missing.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the Signora Idalie, had she not provided herself with a palfrey?\u201d\r\nasked the Englishman, sneering. They were now about to mount, when it\r\nwas proposed to take a last look of the temples by moonlight. The\r\nPrincess opposed this, but vainly; her conscience made her voice faint,\r\nand took from her the usual decision of her manner; so she walked on\r\nsilently, half fearful that her foot might strike against some object of\r\nterror, and at every word spoken by the party, anticipating an\r\nexclamation of horror; the fitful moonbeams seemed to disclose here and\r\nthere ghastly countenances and mangled limbs, and the dew of night\r\nappeared to her excited imagination as the slippery moisture of the\r\nlife-blood of her victim.\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely entered the temple, when a peasant brought the news\r\nthat the steamboat was gone;\u2014he led Ladislas\u2019 horse, who had put the\r\nbridle into the man\u2019s hands on embarking; and the fellow declared that\r\nthe fainting Idalie was his companion. Terror at the prospect of their\r\ndark ride, indignation at the selfish proceeding of the lovers, raised\r\nevery voice against them; and the Princess, whom conscience had before\r\nmade the most silent, hearing that the Pole was alive and safe, was now\r\nloudest and most bitter in her remarks. As they were thus all gathered\r\ntogether in dismay, debating what was to be done, and the Princess\r\nDashkhoff in no gentle terms railing at the impropriety and ingratitude\r\nof Idalie\u2019s behaviour, and declaring that Poles alone could conduct\r\nthemselves with such mingled deceit and baseness, a figure all bloody\r\narose from the ground at her feet, and as the moon cast its pale rays on\r\nhis yet paler countenance, she recognised Giorgio. The ladies shrieked,\r\nthe men rushed towards him, while the Princess, desiring the earth to\r\nopen and swallow her, stood transfixed, as by a spell, gazing on the\r\ndying man in terror and despair.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has escaped, lady,\u201d said Giorgio; \u201cLadislas has escaped your plots,\r\nand I am become their victim.\u201d He fell as he spoke these words, and when\r\nthe Englishman drew near to raise, and if possible assist him, he found\r\nthat life had entirely flown.\r\n\r\nThus ended the adventures of the Pole at Naples. The Princess returned\r\nin her cal\u00e8che alone, for none would bear her company; the next day she\r\nleft Naples, and was on her way to Russia, where her crime was unknown,\r\nexcept to those who had been accomplices in it. Marietta spread the\r\nintelligence of her sister\u2019s marriage, and thus entirely cleared\r\nIdalie\u2019s fair fame; and quitting Italy soon after, joined the happy\r\nLadislas and his bride at Paris.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XV.\r\n\r\n                              _EUPHRASIA._\r\n\r\n                           A TALE OF GREECE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was not long after the breaking out of the Greek Revolution that\r\nHarry Valency visited Greece. Many an Englishman was led thither at that\r\ntime by the spirit of adventure, and many perished. Valency was not\r\nnineteen; his spirit was wild and reckless;\u2014thought or care had never\r\ntouched his brow; his heart was too light for love. Restless and\r\nenergetic, he longed to try his powers, with the instinct that leads the\r\nyoung deer to butt against trees, or to wrestle with each other in the\r\nforest-dells. He was the only son of a widowed mother, whose life was\r\nwrapped in his, and he loved her fondly; yet left her, impelled by a\r\ndesire for adventure, unable to understand what anxiety and fear meant;\r\nand in his own person eager to meet even misfortune, so that it came in\r\na guise to call forth manly and active struggles. He longed to have the\r\npages of his young life written over by deeds that would hereafter be\r\nmemories, to which he could turn with delight. The cause of Greece\r\nwarmed his soul. He was in a transport of ecstasy when he touched the\r\nshores of that antique land, and looked around on mountain and\r\nmountain-stream, whose names were associated with the most heroic acts,\r\nand the most sublime poetry man ever achieved or wrote. Yes, he was now\r\nin Greece. He was about to fight in her cause against the usurping Turk.\r\nHe had prepared himself by a sedulous study of Romaic; he was on his way\r\nto the seat of Government, to offer his services. To proceed thither\r\nfrom the spot where he had disembarked was a matter of some difficulty;\r\nthe Turkish troops being then in possession of many of the passes. At\r\nlength he heard that a band of about fifty Greek soldiers, headed by a\r\nyoung but brave and renowned chief, was about to pursue the same road;\r\nhe asked, and obtained leave to accompany them.\r\n\r\nHow delightful was the commencement of the journey! How beautiful the\r\ncountry\u2014defile and steep hill-side, by which they proceeded; where the\r\ngrey olive clothed the upland, or vines, embracing elms, red now with\r\nlate summer tints, varied the scene. The mountain-tops were bare, or\r\ncrowned with pines, and torrents ran down the sides and fed a stream in\r\nthe dell. The air was balmy; the cicada loud and merry\u2014to live was to be\r\nhappy. Valency was mounted on a spirited horse; he made it leap and\r\ncaracole. He threw a spear against a tree, and dashed after to recover\r\nit. He fired at a mark as he hurried on at full gallop; every feat was\r\ninsufficient to tame his exhaustless spirits.\r\n\r\nThe chief marked him with eyes, whose deep melancholy expression\r\ndarkened as he gazed. He was known as bravest among the brave; yet\r\ngentle as a woman. He was young and singularly handsome; his countenance\r\nwas stamped with traces of intellectual refinement, while his person was\r\ntall, muscular, and strong, but so gracefully formed, that every\r\nattitude reminded you of some Praxitilean shape of his own native land.\r\nOnce he had been more beautiful; joy, as well as tenderness, and a\r\nsoldier\u2019s ardour had lighted up his dark eye; his lip had been the home\r\nof smiles, and the thoughts, which presided in his brow, had been as\r\nclear and soft and gladsome as that godlike brow itself. Now this was\r\nchanged. Grief had become a master passion: his cheeks were sunken; his\r\neye seemed to brood eternally over melancholy regrets; his measured\r\nharmonious voice was attuned to the utterance of no light fancy or gay\r\nsallies; he spoke only the necessary words of direction to his\r\nfollowers, and then silence and gloom gathered over his face. His sorrow\r\nwas respected; for it was known to be well founded, and to spring from a\r\nrecent disaster. If any of his troop desired to indulge in merriment,\r\nthey withdrew from his vicinity. It was strange to them to hear the\r\nlight laugh of the English youth ring through the grove, and to catch\r\nthe tones of his merry voice, as he sang some of their own gayest songs.\r\nThe chief gazed with interest. There was a winning frankness in the boy;\r\nhe was so very young, and all he did was in graceful accordance with his\r\nage. We are alike mere youths, thought the chief, and how different! Yet\r\nsoon he may become like me. He soars like an eagle; but the eagle may be\r\nwounded, and stoop to earth; because earth contains its secret and its\r\nregret.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Valency, who was some hundred yards in advance, was encountered\r\nby a Greek, riding at full speed towards the advancing troop.\r\n\r\n\u201cBack! back! silence!\u201d the man cried. He was a scout, who had been sent\r\non before, and now brought tidings that a troop of three or four hundred\r\nof the Turkish army were entering the defile, and would soon advance on\r\nthe handful of men which Valency accompanied. The scout rode directly up\r\nto the leader, and made his report, adding,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have yet time. If we fall back but a quarter of a mile, there is a\r\npath I know, by which I can guide you across the mountain; on the other\r\nside we shall be safe.\u201d\r\n\r\nA smile of scorn for a moment wreathed the lip of the chief at the word\r\nsafety, but his face soon reassumed its usual sad composure. The troop\r\nhad halted; each man bent his eye on the leader. Valency, in particular,\r\nmarked the look of scorn, and felt that he would never retreat before\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n\u201cComrades!\u201d the chief thus addressed his men, \u201cit shall never be said\r\nthat Greeks fell back to make way for the destroyers; we will betake\r\nourselves to our old warfare. Before we entered this olive wood, we\r\npassed a thick cover, where the dark jutting mountain-side threw a deep\r\nshadow across our path, and the torrent drowned all sound of voice or\r\nhoof. There we shall find ambush; there the enemy will meet death.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe turned his horse\u2019s head, and in a few minutes reached the spot he\r\nnamed; the men were mostly eager for the fray\u2014while one or two eyed the\r\nmountain-side, and then the path that led to the village, which they had\r\nquitted that morning. The chief saw their look, and he glanced also at\r\nthe English youth, who had thrown himself from his horse, and was busy\r\nloading and priming his arms. The chief rode up to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are our guest and fellow-traveller,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not our comrade\r\nin the fight. We are about to meet danger\u2014it may be that not one of us\r\nshall escape. You have no injuries to avenge, no liberty to gain; you\r\nhave friends\u2014probably a mother\u2014in your native land. You must not fall\r\nwith us. I am going to send a message to warn the village we last passed\r\nthrough\u2014do you accompany my messengers.\u201d\r\n\r\nValency had listened attentively at first; but as the chief continued,\r\nhis attention reverted to his task of loading his pistols. The last\r\nwords called a blush into his cheek.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou treat me as a boy,\u201d he cried; \u201cI may be one in aspect, but you\r\nshall find me a man in heart this day. You also young, I have not\r\ndeserved your scorn!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe chief caught the youth\u2019s flashing eye. He held out his hand to him,\r\nsaying, \u201cForgive me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will,\u201d said Valency, \u201con one condition; give me a post of danger\u2014of\r\nhonour. You owe it to me in reparation of the insult you offered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBe it so,\u201d said the chief; \u201cyour place shall be at my side.\u201d\r\n\r\nA few minutes more and his dispositions were made;\u2014two of the most\r\ndown-hearted of the troop were despatched to alarm the village, the rest\r\nwere placed behind the rocks; beneath the bushes, wherever broken\r\nground, or tuft of underwood, or fragment from the cliff, afforded\r\nshelter and concealment, a man was placed; while the chief himself took\r\nhis stand on an elevated platform, and, sheltered by a tree, gazed upon\r\nthe road. Soon the tramp of horses, the busy sound of feet and voices\r\nwere heard, overpowering the rushing of the stream; and turban and\r\nmusket could be distinguished as the enemy\u2019s troop threaded the defile.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe shout of battle\u2014the firing\u2014the clash of weapons were over. Above the\r\ncrest of the hill, whose side had afforded ambush to the Greeks, the\r\ncrescent moon hung, just about to dip behind; the stars in her train\r\nburnt bright as lamps floating in the firmament; while the fire-flies\r\nflashed among the myrtle underwood and up the mountain-side; and\r\nsometimes the steel of the arms strewn around, dropped from the hand of\r\nthe dead, caught and reflected the flashes of the celestial or earthly\r\nstars. The ground was strewn with the slain. Such of the enemy as had\r\ncut their way through were already far\u2014the sound of their horses\u2019 hoofs\r\nhad died away. The Greeks who had fled across the mountain had reached a\r\nplace of safety\u2014none lay there but the silent dead\u2014cold as the moonbeam\r\nthat rested for a moment on their pale faces. All were still and\r\nmotionless; some lay on the hill-side among the underwood\u2014some on the\r\nopen road\u2014horses and men had fallen, pell mell\u2014none moved\u2014none breathed.\r\n\r\nYet there was a sigh\u2014it was lost in the murmur of the stream; a groan\r\nsucceeded, and then a voice feeble and broken, \u201cMy mother, my poor\r\nmother!\u201d\u2014the pale lips that spoke these words could form no other, a\r\ngush of tears followed. The cry seemed to awake another form from among\r\nthe dead. One of the prostrate bodies raised itself slowly and painfully\r\non its arm, the eyes were filmy, the countenance pallid from approaching\r\ndeath, the voice was hollow, yet firm, that said, \u201cWho speaks?\u2014who\r\nlives?\u2014who weeps?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe question struck shame to the wounded man; he checked his overflow of\r\npassionate sobbings. The other spoke again, \u201cIt was not the voice of a\r\nGreek\u2014yet I thought I had saved that gallant boy\u2014the ball meant for him\r\nis now in my side.\u2014Speak again, young Englishman\u2014on whom do you call?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn her who will weep my death too bitterly\u2014on my mother,\u201d replied\r\nValency, and tears would follow the loved name.\r\n\r\n\u201cArt thou wounded to death?\u201d asked the chief.\r\n\r\n\u201cThus unaided I must die,\u201d he replied; \u201cyet, could I reach those waters,\r\nI might live\u2014I must try.\u201d And Valency rose; he staggered a few steps,\r\nand fell heavily at the feet of the chief. He had fainted. The Greek\r\nlooked on the ghastly pallor of his face; he half rose\u2014his own wound did\r\nnot bleed, but it was mortal, and a deadly sickness had gathered round\r\nhis heart, and chilled his brow, which he strove to master, that he\r\nmight save the English boy. The effort brought cold drops on his brow,\r\nas he rose on his knees and stooped to raise the head of Valency; he\r\nshuddered to feel the warm moisture his hand encountered. It is his\r\nblood; his life-blood he thought; and again he placed his head on the\r\nearth, and continued a moment still, summoning what vitality remained to\r\nhim to animate his limbs. Then with a determined effort he rose, and\r\nstaggered to the banks of the stream. He held a steel cap in his\r\nhand\u2014and now he stooped down to fill it; but with the effort the ground\r\nslid from under him, and he fell. There was a ringing in his ears\u2014a cold\r\ndew on his brow\u2014his breath came thick\u2014the cap had fallen from his\r\nhand\u2014he was dying. The bough of a tree, shot off in the morning\u2019s mel\u00e9e,\r\nlay near;\u2014the mind, even of a dying man, can form swift, unerring\r\ncombinations of thought;\u2014it was his last chance\u2014the bough was plunged in\r\nthe waters, and he scattered the grateful, reviving drops over his face;\r\nvigour returned with the act, and he could stoop and fill the cap, and\r\ndrink a deep draught, which for a moment restored the vital powers. And\r\nnow he carried water to Valency; he dipped the unfolded turban of a Turk\r\nin the stream, and bound the youth\u2019s wound, which was a deep sabre cut\r\nin the shoulder, that had bled copiously. Valency revived\u2014life gathered\r\nwarm in his heart\u2014his cheeks, though still pale, lost the ashy hue of\r\ndeath\u2014his limbs again seemed willing to obey his will\u2014he sat up, but he\r\nwas too weak, and his head dropped. As a mother tending her sick\r\nfirst-born, the Greek chief hovered over him; he brought a cloak to\r\npillow his head; as he picked up this, he found that some careful\r\nsoldier had brought a small bag at his saddle-bow, in which was a loaf\r\nand a bunch or two of grapes; he gave them to the youth, who ate.\r\nValency now recognised his saviour; at first he wondered to see him\r\nthere, tending on him, apparently unhurt; but soon the chief sank to the\r\nground, and Valency could mark the rigidity of feature, and ghastliness\r\nof aspect, that portended death. In his turn he would have assisted his\r\nfriend; but the chief stopped him\u2014\u201cYou die if you move,\u201d he said; \u201cyour\r\nwound will bleed afresh, and you will die, while you cannot aid me. My\r\nweakness does not arise from mere loss of blood. The messenger of death\r\nhas reached a vital part\u2014yet a little while and the soul will obey the\r\nsummons. It is slow, slow is the deliverance; yet the long creeping hour\r\nwill come at last, and I shall be free.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not speak thus,\u201d cried Valency; \u201cI am strong now\u2014I will go for\r\nhelp.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no help for me,\u201d replied the chief, \u201csave the death I desire.\r\nI command you, move not.\u201d\r\n\r\nValency had risen, but the effort was vain: his knees bent under him,\r\nhis head spun round; before he could save himself he had sunk to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy torture yourself?\u201d said the chief. \u201cA few hours and help will come:\r\nit will not injure you to pass this interval beneath this calm sky. The\r\ncowards who fled will alarm the country; by dawn succour will be here:\r\nyou must wait for it. I too must wait\u2014not for help, but for death. It is\r\nsoothing even to me to die here beneath this sky, with the murmurs of\r\nyonder stream in my ear, the shadows of my native mountains thrown\r\nathwart. Could aught save me, it would be the balmy airs of this most\r\nblessed night; my soul feels the bliss, though my body is sick and fast\r\nstiffening in death. Such was not the hour when she died whom soon I\r\nshall meet, my Euphrasia, my own sweet sister, in heaven!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was strange, Valency said, that at such an hour, but half saved from\r\ndeath, and his preserver in the grim destroyer\u2019s clutches, that he\r\nshould feel curiosity to know the Greek chief\u2019s story. His youth, his\r\nbeauty, his valour\u2014the act, which Valency well remembered, of his\r\nspringing forward so as to shield him with his own person\u2014his last words\r\nand thoughts devoted to the soft recollection of a beloved\r\nsister,\u2014awakened an interest beyond even the present hour, fraught as it\r\nwas with the chances of life and death. He questioned the chief.\r\nProbably fever had succeeded to his previous state of weakness, imparted\r\na deceitful strength, and even inclined him to talk; for thus dying,\r\nunaided and unsheltered, with the starry sky overhead, he willingly\r\nreverted to the years of his youth and to the miserable event which a\r\nfew months before had eclipsed the sun of his life and rendered death\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey\u2014brother and sister, Constantine and Euphrasia\u2014were the last of\r\ntheir race. They were orphans; their youth was passed under the\r\nguardianship of the brother by adoption of their father, whom they named\r\nfather, and who loved them. He was a glorious old man, nursed in classic\r\nlore, and more familiar with the deeds of men who had glorified his\r\ncountry several thousand years before than with any more modern names.\r\nYet all who had ever done and suffered for Greece were embalmed in his\r\nmemory, and honoured as martyrs in the best of causes. He had been\r\neducated in Paris, and travelled in Europe and America, and was aware of\r\nthe progress made in the science of politics all over the civilised\r\nworld. He felt that Greece would soon share the benefits to arise from\r\nthe changes then operating, and he looked forward at no distant day to\r\nits liberation from bondage. He educated his young ward for that day.\r\nHad he believed that Greece would have continued hopelessly enslaved, he\r\nhad brought him up as a scholar and a recluse: but, assured of the\r\nimpending struggle, he made him a warrior; he implanted a detestation of\r\nthe oppressor, a yearning love for the sacred blessings of freedom, a\r\nnoble desire to have his name enrolled among the deliverers of his\r\ncountry. The education he bestowed on Euphrasia was yet more singular.\r\nHe knew that though liberty must be bought and maintained by the sword,\r\nyet that its dearest blessings must be derived from civilisation and\r\nknowledge; and he believed women to be the proper fosterers of these.\r\nThey cannot handle a sword nor endure bodily labour for their country,\r\nbut they could refine the manners, exalt the souls\u2014impart honour, and\r\ntruth, and wisdom to their relatives and their children. Euphrasia,\r\ntherefore, he made a scholar. By nature she was an enthusiast and a\r\npoet. The study of the classic literature of her country corrected her\r\ntaste and exalted her love of the beautiful. While a child, she\r\nimprovised passionate songs of liberty; and as she grew in years and\r\nloveliness, and her heart opened to tenderness, and she became aware of\r\nall the honour and happiness that a woman must derive from being held\r\nthe friend of man, not his slave, she thanked God that she was a Greek\r\nand a Christian; and holding fast by the advantages which these names\r\nconferred, she looked forward eagerly to the day when Mohammedanism\r\nshould no longer contaminate her native land, and when her countrywomen\r\nshould be awakened from ignorance and sloth in which they were plunged,\r\nand learn that their proper vocation in the creation was that of mothers\r\nof heroes and teachers of sages.\r\n\r\nHer brother was her idol, her hope, her joy. And he who had been taught\r\nthat his career must be that of deeds, not words, yet was fired by her\r\npoetry and eloquence to desire glory yet more eagerly, and to devote\r\nhimself yet more entirely and with purer ardour to the hope of one day\r\nliving and dying for his country. The first sorrow the orphans knew was\r\nthe death of their adopted father. He descended to the grave full of\r\nyears and honour. Constantine was then eighteen; his fair sister had\r\njust entered her fifteenth year. Often they spent the night beside the\r\nrevered tomb of their lost friend, talking of the hopes and aspirations\r\nhe had implanted. The young can form such sublime, such beautiful\r\ndreams. No disappointment, no evil, no bad passion shadows their\r\nglorious visions. To dare and do greatly for Greece was the ambition of\r\nConstantine. To cheer and watch over her brother, to regulate his wilder\r\nand more untaught soul, to paint in celestial colours the bourne he\r\ntended towards by action, were Euphrasia\u2019s tasks.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a heaven,\u201d said the dying man as he told his tale,\u2014\u201cthere is a\r\nparadise for those who die in the just cause. I know not what joys are\r\nthere prepared for the blest; but they can scarcely transcend those that\r\nwere mine as I listened to my own sweet sister, and felt my heart swell\r\nwith patriotism and fond, warm affection.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt length there was a stir through the land, and Constantine made a\r\njourney of some distance, to confer with the capitani of the mountains,\r\nand to prepare for the outbreak of the revolution. The moment came,\r\nsooner even than he expected. As an eagle chained when the iron links\r\ndrop from him, and with clang of wing and bright undazzled eye he soars\r\nto heaven, so did Constantine feel when freedom to Greece became the\r\nwar-cry. He was still among the mountains when first the echoes of his\r\nnative valleys repeated that animating, that sacred word. Instead of\r\nreturning, as he intended, to his Athenian home, he was hurried off to\r\nWestern Greece, and became a participator in a series of warlike\r\nmovements, the promised success of which filled him with transport.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a pause came in the delirium of joy which possessed his soul.\r\nHe received not the accustomed letters from his sister\u2014missives which\r\nhad been to him angelic messengers, teaching him patience with the\r\nunworthy\u2014hope in disappointment\u2014certainty of final triumph. Those dear\r\nletters ceased; and he thought he saw in the countenances of his friends\r\naround a concealed knowledge of evil. He questioned them: their answers\r\nwere evasive. At the same time, they endeavoured to fill his mind with\r\nthe details of some anticipated exploit in which his presence and\r\nco-operation was necessary. Day after day passed; he could not leave his\r\npost without injury to the cause, without even the taint of dishonour.\r\nHe belonged to a band of Albanians, by whom he had been received as a\r\nbrother and he could not desert them in the hour of danger. But the\r\nsuspense grew too terrible; and at length, finding that there was an\r\ninterval of a few days which he might call his own, he left the camp,\r\nresting neither day nor night; dismounting from one horse only to\r\nbestride another, in forty-eight hours he was in Athens, before his\r\nvacant, desecrated home. The tale of horror was soon told. Athens was\r\nstill in the hands of the Turks; the sister of a rebel had become the\r\nprey of the oppressor. She had none to guard her. Her matchless beauty\r\nhad been seen and marked by the son of the pasha; she had for the last\r\ntwo months been immured in his harem.\r\n\r\n\u201cDespair is a cold, dark feeling,\u201d said the dying warrior; \u201cif I may\r\nname that despair which had a hope\u2014a certainty\u2014an aim. Had Euphrasia\r\ndied I had wept. Now my eyes were horn\u2014my heart stone. I was silent. I\r\nneither expressed resentment nor revenge. I concealed myself by day; at\r\nnight I wandered round the tyrant\u2019s dwelling. It was a pleasure-palace,\r\none of the most luxurious in our beloved Athens. At this time it was\r\ncarefully guarded: my character was known, and Euphrasia\u2019s worth; and\r\nthe oppressor feared the result of his deed. Still, under shadow of\r\ndarkness I drew near. I marked the position of the women\u2019s apartments\u2014I\r\nlearned the number\u2014the length of the watch\u2014the orders they received, and\r\nthen I returned to the camp. I revealed my project to a few select\r\nspirits. They were fired by my wrongs, and eager to deliver my\r\nEuphrasia.\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\nConstantine broke off\u2014a spasm of pain shook his body. After this had\r\npassed he lay motionless for a few minutes; then starting up, as fever\r\nand delirium, excited by the exertion of speaking, increased by the\r\nagonies of recollection, at last fully possessed him. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d he\r\ncried. \u201cFire! Yes, the palace burns. Do you not hear the roaring of the\r\nflames, and thunder too\u2014the artillery of Heaven levelled against the\r\nunblest? Ha! a shot\u2014he falls\u2014they are driven back\u2014now fling the\r\ntorches\u2014the wood crackles\u2014there, there are the women\u2019s rooms\u2014ha! poor\r\nvictims! lo! you shudder and fly! Fear not; give me only my\r\nEuphrasia!\u2014my own Euphrasia! No disguise can hide thee, dressed as a\r\nTurkish bride crowned with flowers, thy lovely face, the seat of\r\nunutterable woe\u2014still, my sweet sister, even in this smoke and tumult of\r\nthis house, thou art the angel of my life! Spring into my arms, poor,\r\nfrightened bird; cling to me\u2014it is herself\u2014her voice\u2014her fair arms are\r\nround my neck\u2014what ruin\u2014what flame\u2014what choking smoke\u2014what driving storm\r\ncan stay me? Soft! the burning breach is passed\u2014there are\r\nsteps\u2014gently\u2014dear one, I am firm\u2014fear not!\u2014what eyes glare?\u2014fear not,\r\nEuphrasia, he is dead\u2014the miserable retainers of the tyrant fell beneath\r\nour onset\u2014ha! a shot\u2014gracious Panagia, is this thy protection?\u201d Thus did\r\nhe continue to rave: the onset, the burning of the palace, the\r\ndeliverance of his sister, all seemed to pass again vividly as if in\r\npresent action. His eyes glared; he tossed up his arms; he shouted as if\r\ncalling his followers around him; and then in tones of heartfelt\r\ntenderness he addressed the fair burden he fancied that he bore\u2014till,\r\nwith a shriek, he cried again, \u201cA shot!\u201d and sank to the ground as if\r\nhis heartstrings had broken.\r\n\r\nAn interval of calm succeeded; he was exhausted; his voice was broken.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have I told thee?\u201d he continued feebly; \u201cI have said how a mere\r\nhandful of men attacked the palace, and drove back the guards\u2014how we\r\nstrove in vain to make good our entrance\u2014fresh troops were on their\r\nway\u2014there was no alternative; we fired the palace. Deep in the seclusion\r\nof the harem the women had retreated, a herd of frightened deer. One\r\nalone stood erect. Her eyes bent on the intruders\u2014a dagger in her\r\nhand\u2014majestic and fearless, her face was marked with traces of passed\r\nsuffering, but at the moment the stern resolution her soft features\r\nexpressed was more than human. The moment she saw me, all was changed;\r\nthe angel alone beamed in her countenance. Her dagger fell from her\r\nhand\u2014she was in my arms\u2014I bore her from the burning roof\u2014the rest you\r\nknow; have I not said it? Some miscreant, who survived the slaughter,\r\nand yet lay as dead on the earth, aimed a deadly shot. She did not\r\nshriek. At first she clung closer to my neck, and then I felt her frame\r\nshiver in my arms and her hold relax. I trusted that fear alone moved\r\nher; but she knew not fear\u2014it was death. Horses had been prepared, and\r\nwere waiting; a few hours more and I hoped to be on our way to the west,\r\nto that portion of Greece that was free. But I felt her head fall on my\r\nshoulder. I heard her whisper, \u2018I die, my brother! carry me to our\r\nfather\u2019s tomb.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cMy soul yearned to comply with her request; but it was impossible. The\r\ncity was alarmed; troops gathering from all quarters. Our safety lay in\r\nflight, for still I thought that her wound was not mortal. I bore her to\r\nthe spot where we had left our horses. Here two or three of my comrades\r\nspeedily joined me; they had rescued the women of the harem from the\r\nflames, but the various sounds denoting the advance of the Turkish\r\nsoldiery caused them to hurry from the scene. I leapt on my horse, and\r\nplaced my sweet sister before me, and we fled amain through desert\r\nstreets, I well knew how to choose, and along the lanes of the suburbs\r\ninto the open country, where, deviating from the high-road, along which\r\nI directed my companions to proceed in all haste\u2014alone with my beloved\r\nburden, I sought a solitary, unsuspected spot among the neighbouring\r\nhills. The storm which had ceased for a time, now broke afresh; the\r\ndeafening thunder drowned every other sound, while the frequent glare of\r\nthe lightning showed us our path; my horse did not quail before it.\r\nEuphrasia still lay clinging to me; no complaint escaped her; a few\r\nwords of fondness, of encouragement, of pious resignation, she now and\r\nthen breathed forth. I knew not she was dying, till at last entering a\r\nretired valley, where an olive wood afforded shelter, and still better\r\nthe portico of a fallen ancient temple, I dismounted and bore her to the\r\nmarble steps, on which I placed her. Then indeed I felt how near the\r\nbeloved one was to death, from which I could not save her. The lightning\r\nshowed me her face\u2014pale as the marble which pillowed it. Her dress was\r\ndabbled in warm blood, which soon stained the stones on which she lay. I\r\ntook her hand; it was deathly cold. I raised her from the marble; I\r\npillowed her cheek upon my heart. I repressed my despair, or rather my\r\ndespair in that hour was mild and soft as herself. There was no help\u2014no\r\nhope. The life-blood oozed fast from her side; scarce could she raise\r\nher heavy eyelids to look on me; her voice could no longer articulate my\r\nname. The burden of her fair limbs grew heavier and more chill; soon it\r\nwas a corpse only that I held. When I knew that her sufferings were\r\nover, I raised her once more in my arms, and once more I placed her\r\nbefore me on my horse, and betook me to my journey. The storm was over\r\nnow, and the moon bright above. Earth glittered under the rays, and a\r\nsoft breeze swept by, as if heaven itself became clear and peaceful to\r\nreceive her stainless soul, and present it to its Maker. By morning\u2019s\r\ndawn, I stopped at a convent gate, and rang. To the holy maidens within\r\nI consigned my own fair Euphrasia. I kissed but once again her dear\r\nbrow, which spoke of peace in death; and then saw her placed upon a\r\nbier, and was away, back to my camp, to live and die for Greece.\u201d\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe grew more silent as he became weaker. Now and then he spoke a few\r\nwords to record some other of Euphrasia\u2019s perfections, or to repeat some\r\nof her dying words; to speak of her magnanimity, her genius, her love,\r\nand his own wish to die.\r\n\r\n\u201cI might have lived,\u201d he said, \u201ctill her image had faded in my mind, or\r\nbeen mingled with less holy memories. I die young, all her own.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis voice grew more feeble after this; he complained of cold. Valency\r\ncontinued: \u201cI contrived to rise, and crawl about, and to collect a\r\ncapote or two, and a pelisse from among the slain, with some of which I\r\ncovered him; and then I drew one over myself, for the air grew chill, as\r\nmidnight had passed away and the morning hour drew near. The warmth\r\nwhich the coverings imparted calmed the aching of my wound, and, strange\r\nto say, I felt slumber creep over me. I tried to watch and wake. At\r\nfirst the stars above and the dark forms of the mountains mingled with\r\nmy dreamy feelings; but soon I lost all sense of where I was, and what I\r\nhad suffered, and slept peacefully and long.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe morning sunbeams, as creeping down the hill-side they at last fell\r\nupon my face, awoke me. At first I had forgotten all thought of the\r\nevents of the past night, and my first impulse was to spring up, crying\r\naloud, where am I? but the stiffness of my limbs and their weakness,\r\nsoon revealed the truth. Gladly I now welcomed the sound of voices, and\r\nmarked the approach of a number of peasants along the ravine. Hitherto,\r\nstrange to say, I had thought only of myself; but with the ideas of\r\nsuccour came the recollection of my companion, and the tale of the\r\nprevious night. I glanced eagerly to where he lay; his posture disclosed\r\nhis state; he was still, and stiff, and dead. Yet his countenance was\r\ncalm and beautiful. He had died in the dear hope of meeting his sister,\r\nand her image had shed peace over the last moment of life.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am ashamed to revert to myself. The death of Constantine is the true\r\nend of my tale. My wound was a severe one. I was forced to leave Greece,\r\nand for some months remained between life and death in Cefalonia, till a\r\ngood constitution saved me, when at once I returned to England.\u201d\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XVI.\r\n\r\n                            _THE ELDER SON._\r\n\r\n\r\nMY father was the second son of a wealthy baronet. As he and his elder\r\nbrother formed all the family of my grandfather, he inherited the whole\r\nof his mother\u2019s fortune, which was considerable, and settled on the\r\nyounger children. He married a lady whom he tenderly loved; and having\r\ntaken orders, and procured preferment, retired to his deanery in the\r\nnorth of Ireland, and there took up his abode. When I was about ten\r\nyears old he lost my mother. I was their only child.\r\n\r\nMy father was something of an ascetic, if such name can be given to a\r\nrigid adherence to the precepts of morality, which arose from the\r\nexcess, and not the absence of feeling. He adored my mother; he mourned\r\nfor her to the verge of insanity; but his grief was silent, devouring,\r\nand gloomy. He never formed another matrimonial engagement: secluding\r\nhimself entirely from society, and given up to the duties of his sacred\r\ncalling, he passed his days in solitude, or in works of charity among\r\nthe poor.\r\n\r\nEven now I cannot remember him without awe. He was a tall and, I\r\nthought, a venerable-looking man; for he was thin and pale, and he was\r\npartly bald. His manners were cold and reserved; he seldom spoke, and\r\nwhen he did it was in such measured phrase, in so calm and solemn a\r\nvoice, and on such serious topics, as resembled rather oracular\r\nenunciation than familiar conversation. He never caressed me; if ever he\r\nstroked my head or drew me on his knee, I felt a mingled alarm and\r\ndelight difficult to describe. Yet, strange to say, my father loved me\r\nalmost to idolatry; and I knew this and repaid his affection with\r\nenthusiastic fondness, notwithstanding his reserve and my awe. He was\r\nsomething greater, and wiser, and better, in my eyes, than any other\r\nhuman being. I was the sole creature he loved; the object of all his\r\nthoughts by day and his dreams by night. Abstracted and even severe as\r\nhe seemed, he has visited my bedside at night, subdued by womanly fears,\r\nand hung over me for hours, to assure himself of my life and well-being.\r\nHe has watched by me in sickness night after night with unwearied\r\nassiduity. He never spoke harshly to me, and treated me at once with a\r\ndistance and gentleness hard to be understood.\r\n\r\nWhen I was eighteen he died. During his last illness the seal was taken\r\nfrom his lips, and his heart threw off that husk within which he had\r\nhitherto concealed its true nature. He died of a rapid consumption,\r\nwhich terminated his existence within six months of his being first\r\ntaken ill. His body wasted under the effects of mortal disease; but his\r\nsoul assumed new life and energy, and his temper became as soft and\r\ndemonstrative as it had hitherto been repulsive and concentrated. He\r\nbecame my father, friend, and brother all in one; a thousand dear\r\nrelationships combined in one stronger than any. This sudden melting,\r\nthis divine sensibility, which expanded at once, having been so long\r\nshut up and hid, was like a miracle. It fascinated and entranced me. I\r\ncould not believe that I was about to lose him at the moment when we\r\ndiscovered each other\u2019s worth: I mean by that expression, as regards\r\nmyself, all the happiness that he derived from the truth and vivacity of\r\nmy filial affection.\r\n\r\nIt were vain to attempt to refer even to our conversations: the sublime\r\nmorality he inculcated; the tenderness and charity of his expressions;\r\nthe overflowing and melting eloquence with which he talked of the\r\naffections of this world, and his aspirations after a better. He died\r\nsuddenly at last, as I was playing to him a simple air my mother loved.\r\nIt was a moment of horror, yet of solemn and pious resignation: his soul\r\nhad sought its native heaven and congenial companion\u2014might it be blest!\r\nYet I had lost him, and grief immeasurable was the result. The\r\nimpression of the misery I suffered can never be entirely worn from my\r\nmind: I often wonder my heart did not break with the violence of my\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nI had been brought up at the deanery, apart from all acquaintances. I\r\nhad had a governess, a most worthy woman, who married just before my\r\nfather was taken ill, and who kindly came to me when all was over, to\r\nendeavour to console the inconsolable. One of my father\u2019s objects in\r\nlife had been to accumulate a fortune for me; not for the sake of\r\nplacing me in the dangerous situation of an heiress, but to render me\r\nindependent. It thus happened that by his ever-lamented death I\r\ninherited considerable wealth. His own fortune, my mother\u2019s, and his\r\nsavings, formed the sum of fifty thousand pounds. He left me under the\r\nguardianship of his elder brother, Sir Richard Gray, with only one\r\nrestriction, that I was not to marry, even with my uncle\u2019s consent, till\r\nI was twenty-one. He wished thus to secure me freedom of choice, and\r\ntime for deliberation. To this sagacious clause I owe the happiness of\r\nmy life.\r\n\r\nAs soon as my health and the first agony of my grief would permit, I\r\nleft the deanery. My kind governess accompanied me to Dublin, and Sir\r\nRichard Gray came hither himself to fetch me, and to carry me to his\r\nseat in England. I was beyond measure surprised when I saw my uncle. He\r\nwas a year older than my father\u2014my venerable father\u2014and he looked in\r\ncomparison a boy. He was indeed under fifty, and had at first sight a\r\njuvenility of aspect quite astonishing. On examination, the traces of\r\nyears and care became perceptible; and there was a haggardness in his\r\nface which contrasted strangely with its expression of thoughtlessness.\r\nNo one could be kinder than he was to me, and yet his very kindness was\r\nrevolting, from the contrast he formed with my lost parent. The world,\r\nsociety, and pleasure occupied his time and thoughts. Solitude and\r\nmisery were synonymous terms with him; and he called everything solitude\r\nthat did not include the idea of a crowd. He rattled away during our\r\njourney, thinking his anecdotes and good stories would enliven me. He\r\nwas so sorry that it was not the season that I could go to London\u2014he\r\nwould have invited his daughter, Lady Hythe, to his seat, that he might\r\narrange a party to enliven it for me; but she was on the Continent, and\r\nhis other married daughter was resident in Scotland. What was to be\r\ndone? He had engagements himself during the shooting season at various\r\ngentlemen\u2019s houses; and I should be moped to death at Beech Grove. This\r\naccount of the seclusion of my retreat was all my comfort. I declared\r\nthat nothing should induce me to go into society for several years. He\r\nstared, and then smiled, and in his usual caressing gallant manner said,\r\nI should do as I liked; he would never contradict me in anything: he\r\nonly hoped that he should be always able to please and gratify me.\r\n\r\nMy uncle\u2019s story is soon told. He married, very early in life, a girl of\r\ninferior rank. His relations were exceedingly enraged, and discarded\r\nhim. His father died; and his grandfather, fearing that he would sell\r\nhis expectations and squander the whole property, offered him a large\r\nimmediate income, upon condition that he would entail the estate upon\r\nhis eldest son. He consented. A few years after, his grandfather died,\r\nand he came into the titles and estate. The new Lady Gray made herself\r\nmany friends from the extreme propriety of her conduct. They had a large\r\nfamily, but lost many children; and she died in childbed of her\r\nyoungest. Five only survived. The eldest son was abroad: two daughters\r\nwere well married, and the youngest, a girl of only twelve years of age,\r\nlived with her governess at the family seat at Hampshire. Sir Richard\r\ntalked kindly of his children, but chiefly of his eldest son, against\r\nwhom therefore I conceived a prejudice; because, from his father\u2019s\r\ndescription, I considered him dissipated and worthless. Such, indeed,\r\nwas my uncle; but I did not dislike him, for by the charm of manner he\r\nvanquished aversion, and I transferred to his favourite son the\r\ndisapprobation he had at first excited. I was glad to hear that my\r\ncousin was at Vienna, and that I was not likely to see him.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Beech Grove on the 29th August. It was a fine summer day,\r\nand the country in all its glory. The house was spacious and elegant,\r\nand situated in an extensive park, laid out with infinite taste, and\r\nkept up with extreme care. All looked so gay and smiling, so unlike the\r\nsombre scenes I had left on the shores of the dark northern ocean, that\r\nI contemplated my new abode with distaste: such is the force of habit.\r\nMy uncle had expected that I should be enchanted with the novel beauty\r\nof an English park and mansion, and was disappointed at my languid\r\npraise. There were no rocks, no sea, no extensive moors. Groves of\r\nbeech, a river threading verdant wooded banks, a variety of upland and\r\nvalley, glade and copse, did not command my admiration; so true it is\r\nthat we seldom admire that which is absolutely new. A few months totally\r\naltered this first impression. The cheerfulness of the scene\r\nimperceptibly acted on my spirits. I became reconciled to its (to a\r\ncertain degree) tameness, and learnt at last to love its refined and\r\nelegant beauty.\r\n\r\nSir Richard talked of visiting and company. He would have called his\r\nneighbours round us, and forced me to accept invitations at the various\r\nhouses where, in the shooting season, were assembled large parties of\r\nthe rich and gay. I earnestly assured him that my depressed spirits and\r\ndeep-rooted sorrow needed tranquillity\u2014that the seclusion which his\r\nhouse promised was its principal attraction\u2014that I was most happy to be\r\nalone. He could not believe my assertions; it hurt his feelings to leave\r\nme in this desert; he actually delayed his departure for two days, not\r\nliking to quit me. At last he went; and speedily, in the pursuit of\r\npleasure, forgot my existence.\r\n\r\nI was not absolutely alone in his house; my cousin Marianne inhabited it\r\nwith me. She was a pretty, agreeable girl, of twelve years of age; and\r\nwe got on very well together. I had recourse to her society when\r\nover-weary of thought; and she was so young that I could leave her, and\r\nbetake myself to my mournful, lonely reveries, whenever I liked, without\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\nI had not been at Beech Grove more than a week, when late one afternoon,\r\non returning from a drive, we distinguished lights in the dining-room.\r\n\u201cCan it be my brother?\u201d cried Marianne; \u201ccan Clinton have arrived?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope not,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, do not say so,\u201d replied the little girl; \u201cyou would love Clinton;\r\nhe is so lively and dear\u2014everybody loves him.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe scarce waited for the steps to be let down, but jumped from the\r\ncarriage. She returned to me in a minute with an air of disappointment,\r\n\u201cIt is only my brother Vernon,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you do not care about him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d she replied, \u201cVernon is very good, and all that; but he is\r\nquite different from Clinton; he may stay a month in the house and I not\r\nsee him twice.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe habit of solitude had rendered me a little bashful I had dined early\r\nwith my cousin, and the new-comer was at dinner. I went into the\r\ndrawing-room therefore, and made her stay with me, and awaited his\r\nentrance with some alarm. He soon joined us. As he entered, I was struck\r\nwith his being the handsomest man I had ever seen. His complexion was a\r\nclear olive; his eyes a dark blue; his head small and well shaped; his\r\nfigure scarcely above the middle size, but slender and elegant. I\r\nexpected the courteous manners of my uncle to correspond with the grace\r\nof his appearance; but Vernon had no vivacity, no softness. His words\r\nwere pregnant with meaning, and his eyes flashed fire as he spoke; but\r\nhis address was abrupt, his conversation pointed and sarcastic, and a\r\ndisagreeable ironical smile in which he indulged deteriorated greatly\r\nfrom his good looks. Still, he was very handsome, very clever, and very\r\nentertaining.\r\n\r\nOne part of Marianne\u2019s description at least was erroneous. He spent\r\nevery day and all day with us. He rode or walked with us in the morning;\r\nread to us in the evening; conversed as we worked or painted; and did\r\nall that a person most sedulous to please could do, except turning over\r\nthe leaves of our music-books. He did not like music\u2014of which my father\r\nwas so passionately fond; in all else his tastes seemed mine. He gave me\r\nItalian lessons; and, except when I drove him away, was never absent\r\nfrom our side. Marianne declared that her brother Vernon was an altered\r\nman. I thought that I knew whence the alteration sprung.\r\n\r\nWhat girl of eighteen, just emerged from solitude, could perceive the\r\nbirth of love in the heart of a young, accomplished, and handsome man,\r\nand not feel her vanity gratified? My peculiar education had prevented\r\nmy having any of the coquettishness of beauty or the insolence of\r\nwealth. I own I felt elated. I became of consequence in my own eyes; and\r\nmy silly heart swelled with conscious triumph. Vernon grew each day more\r\nopenly devoted to me, more solicitous to please, more flattering and\r\nattentive. He advanced with imperceptible steps to the desired bourne,\r\nand no impatience of temper disturbed for a moment his progress.\r\nStealthy as a serpent, and as wily, he became necessary to my comfort;\r\nand I had compromised myself by displaying my vain triumph in my\r\nconquest before he betrayed himself by a word.\r\n\r\nWhen I found that he sought a return for his love, I was frightened. I\r\ndiscovered that with all his talents and agreeable qualities I scarcely\r\nliked him, and certainly could never feel a sentiment more tender than\r\nfriendship. I reproached myself for my ingratitude\u2014I felt ashamed of my\r\nvacillation. He saw my struggles\u2014he was all humility\u2014he did not deserve\r\nbetter\u2014he was satisfied if I would only be a sister to him\u2014pity\r\nhim\u2014endure his presence. I agreed, and reassumed my familiarity and\r\ngood-humour.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe his refined artifice, or the wonderful\r\nassiduity with which he watched by his concealed net till I was\r\ncompletely immeshed. He contrived first that I should consent to listen\r\nto him talking of his passion; then he excited my pity for his\r\nsufferings\u2014he was eloquent in describing them and in exalting my merits.\r\nHe asked for so little, he seemed so humble; but he was importunate, and\r\nnever gave up the smallest advantage he had once gained. Forgotten by my\r\nuncle, unknown and unregarded by the rest of the world, I was delivered\r\nover to his machinations. Day after day he renewed them. He discerned\r\nand worked upon every weakness of my character. My fear to do wrong; my\r\nalarm at the idea of being the occasion of pain; my desire to preserve\r\nmy integrity without a flaw,\u2014these might be termed virtues; but,\r\ndistorted and exaggerated by natural conceit and youthful inexperience,\r\nthey rendered me a too easy prey. At last he extracted from me a promise\r\nto marry him when I should be of age. This pledge seemed the only method\r\nleft me to prove my delicacy and truth. I gave it the more readily\r\nbecause I admired his talents, and believed that he deserved a better\r\nwife than I, and that my want of love was a fault in me for which I\r\nought to compensate to him. With all the rashness and inexperience of my\r\nage, I confess that I even tried to conceal my latent aversion; so that\r\nwhen, after having obtained my promise, he went away for a week, I\r\nwillingly assented to his request that I should correspond with him, and\r\nmy letters were full of affection. I found it easier to write than speak\r\nwhat I did not really feel, and was glad to show my gratitude and my\r\nsense of his attachment at an easy rate. At the same time, I consented\r\nto keep our engagement secret, that thus I might have an excuse for\r\npreserving the reserve of my conduct. I took advantage of this wish on\r\nhis part to insist on his leaving me for a time. I was glad when he\r\nwent, yet mortified at the readiness of his obedience.\r\n\r\nI must not be unjust. Vernon had many faults, but coldness of feeling\r\nwas not among them. Vehemence and passion were his characteristics,\r\nthough he could unite them to a deliberation in design, and a wiliness\r\nin execution, without example. He had determined before he saw me to win\r\nme and my fortune; but such was the violence of his disposition, that he\r\nwas unavoidably caught in his own toils; and the project that was\r\nfounded on self-interest ended in making him the slave of love\u2014of a girl\r\nwhom he despised. He went when I bade him eagerly; but he fulfilled his\r\naim better by so doing. My letters were to be confirmations strong\r\nagainst me\u2014in case that hereafter, as he too justly feared, I should\r\nwish to retract my vows. I heedlessly accomplished his ends, beyond his\r\nmost sanguine expectations. My letters were those of a betrothed bride;\r\nand what they might want in tenderness was made up by their\r\nuncompromising acknowledgment of our relative position. Having obtained\r\nthese testimonies, he returned. I was not sorry. I was too little\r\npleased with myself to be in love with solitude. His presence kept alive\r\nthe feeling of irresistible fate to which I had yielded; and his society\r\nenlivened the monotonous quiet of Beech Grove.\r\n\r\nAt length Christmas came, and my uncle returned and filled his house\r\nwith visitors. Then the darker shades of Vernon\u2019s character became\r\napparent. He was as jealous as an Italian. His disposition was sombre\r\nand averse to sociable pleasures. God knows grief sat too heavy at my\r\nheart to allow me to be very vivacious; still, I wished to please my\r\nuncle, and thought that I had no right to cloud the good-humour of the\r\ncompany; and added to this was the elastic spirit of youth, which sprung\r\neagerly and spontaneously from the gloom and mystery of Vernon\u2019s\r\nartifices into the more congenial atmosphere of friendly intercourse. He\r\nsaw me unlike anything he had ever seen in me before\u2014sprightly, and\r\nready to share the amusement of the hour. He groaned in bitterness of\r\nspirit. He reproached\u2014reprehended\u2014and became a very taskmaster. I was\r\nnaturally timid and docile\u2014in vain did my spirit revolt from his\r\ninjustice: he gained and kept complete ascendency over me. Yet my soul\r\nwas in arms against him even while I submitted to his control, and\r\ndislike began to develop itself in my bosom. I tasked myself severely\r\nfor my ingratitude. I became in appearance kinder than ever; but every\r\ninternal struggle and every outward demonstration had unfortunately one\r\nresult\u2014to alienate my affections more and more from my lover-cousin.\r\n\r\nOur guests left us. My uncle went up to town. He told me he hoped I\r\nwould accompany him there as soon as Lady Hythe returned to chaperon me.\r\nBut I was more averse than ever to visiting London. Bound to Vernon by\r\nmy promises, and wishing to keep my faith with him, I did not like to\r\nexpose myself to the temptation of seeing others I should like better.\r\nBesides, the memory of my father was still unfaded, and I resolved not\r\nto appear in public till the year of mourning was expired. Vernon\r\naccompanied his father to town, but returned again to us almost\r\nimmediately. We appeared to revert to our former mode of life; but the\r\nessence of it was changed. He was moody\u2014I anxious. I almost ventured to\r\naccuse him of ill-temper and tyranny, till, reading in my own heart its\r\nindifference, I was inclined to consider myself the cause of his\r\ndiscontent. I tried to restore his complacency by kindness, and in some\r\ndegree succeeded.\r\n\r\nOne day Sir Richard suddenly appeared at Beech Grove. He seemed\r\nsurprised to find Vernon, and care and even anxiety clouded his usual\r\nhilarity. He told us that he expected Clinton daily, and should\r\nimmediately on his arrival bring him down to Hampshire.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo celebrate my birthday?\u201d asked Vernon, with a sardonic smile; \u201cI am\r\nof age on Friday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said his father; \u201che will not be here so soon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor I so honoured,\u201d said Vernon; \u201cClinton\u2019s coming of age was\r\ncelebrated by tumultuous rejoicings; but he is the Elder Son.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir Richard gave Vernon, who spoke sneeringly, a quick glance\u2014an\r\nindescribable expression of pain crossed his countenance.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you been staying here since Christmas?\u201d he asked at last. Vernon\r\nwould have replied evasively, but Marianne said,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes! he is always here now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou appear to have become very fond of Beech Grove of a sudden,\u201d\r\ncontinued his father. I felt that Sir Richard\u2019s eye was fixed on me as\r\nhe spoke, and I was conscious that not only my cheeks, but my temples\r\nand neck were crimsoned with blushes. Some time after I saw my uncle in\r\nthe shrubbery; he was alone, and the want of society was always so\r\npainful to him, that I thought it but a mark of duteous kindness to join\r\nhim. I wondered, as I approached, to see every token of haggard care on\r\na face usually so smiling. He saw me, and smoothed his brow; he began\r\ntalking of London, of my elder cousin, of his desire that I should\r\nconquer my timidity, and consent to be presented this spring. At length\r\nhe suddenly stopped short, and scrutinizing me as he spoke, said,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cPardon me, dear Ellen, if I annoy you; but I am your guardian, your\r\nsecond father\u2014am I not? Do not be angry, therefore, if I ask you, are\r\nyou attached to my son Vernon?\u201d\r\n\r\nMy natural frankness prompted one reply, but a thousand feelings,\r\ninexplicable but powerful, hung on my tongue. I answered, stammering:\r\n\u201cNo\u2014I believe so\u2014I like him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you do not love him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a question, dear uncle!\u201d I replied, covered with confusion.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it even so?\u201d cried Sir Richard; \u201cand is he to succeed in all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mistake,\u201d I said; for I had a horror of confessing an attachment\r\nwhich, after all, I did not feel, and so of making our engagement more\r\nbinding. But I blushed deeply as I spoke, and my uncle looked\r\nincredulous, and said,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYet it would make you very unhappy if he married another.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d I cried, \u201che has my free leave. I should wish him joy with all\r\nmy heart.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe idea\u2014the hope that he was playing me false, and might release me\r\nfrom my trammels, darted through my mind with a quick thrill of delight.\r\nSir Richard saw that I was in earnest, and his countenance cleared.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a strange thing is maiden coyness,\u201d he observed; \u201cyou blushed so\r\nprettily, Ellen, that I could have sworn you had given your heart to\r\nVernon. But I see I was mistaken; I am glad of it, for he would not suit\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\nNo more was said, but I felt conscience-stricken and miserable. I had\r\ndeceived my uncle, and yet I had not. I had declared that I did not love\r\nhim to whom I had pledged my hand; and the whole was a mystery and an\r\nentanglement that degraded me in my own eyes. I longed to make a full\r\nconfession; yet then all would be over\u2014we should both be inextricably\r\nbound. As it was, some caprice might cause Vernon to transfer his\r\naffection to another, and I could give him entire freedom, without any\r\nhuman being knowing how foolishly I had acted.\r\n\r\nWe had no guests at dinner; Sir Richard was to leave us early the next\r\nmorning. After dinner I speedily retired to the drawing-room, leaving\r\nfather and son together; they remained two hours. I was on the point of\r\nwithdrawing to my own room, to avoid a meeting which alarmed me, I knew\r\nnot why, when they entered. It seemed as if, in the interval of my\r\nabsence, they had received sudden intelligence of a dear friend\u2019s death;\r\nand yet not quite so, for though Vernon looked absorbed in thought, his\r\ngloom was strangely interspersed with glances of swelling triumph; his\r\nsmiles were no longer sneers\u2014yet they did not betray a sunshine of the\r\nheart, but rather joy on a bad victory. He looked on me askance, with a\r\nkind of greedy satisfaction, and at his father with scorn. I trembled,\r\nand turned to my uncle; but sadness and confusion marked his features\u2014he\r\nwas stamped as with disgrace, and quailed beneath my eye; though\r\npresently he rallied, drew a chair near, and was kinder than ever. He\r\ntold me that he was going up to town on the morrow, and that Vernon was\r\nto accompany him; he asked me if there was anything he could do for me,\r\nand testified his affection by a thousand little attentions. Vernon said\r\nnothing, and took leave of me so coldly, that I thought his manner\r\nimplied that he expected to see me in the morning. Thinking it right to\r\nindulge him, I rose early; but he did not come down till long after Sir\r\nRichard, who thanked me for my kindness in disturbing myself on his\r\naccount. They went away immediately after breakfast, and Vernon\u2019s formal\r\nadieu again struck me with wonder. Was it possible that he was indeed\r\ngoing to marry another? This doubt was all my comfort, for I was\r\npainfully agitated by the false position in which I had entangled\r\nmyself, by the mystery that enveloped my actions, and the falsehood\r\nwhich my lips perpetually implied, if they did not utter.\r\n\r\nI was habitually an early riser. On the third morning after the\r\ndeparture of my relations, before I rose, and while I was dressing, I\r\nthought that pebbles were thrown at my window; but my mind was too\r\nengrossed to pay attention, till at last, after my toilette had been\r\nleisurely completed, I looked from my window, and saw Vernon below, in\r\nthe secluded part of the park which it overlooked. I hurried down, my\r\nheart palpitating with anxiety.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been waiting for you these two hours,\u201d he said angrily; \u201cdid you\r\nnot hear my signal?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know of no signal,\u201d I replied; \u201cI am not accustomed to clandestine\r\nappointments.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet you can carry on a clandestine engagement excellently well! You\r\ntold Sir Richard that you did not love me\u2014that you should be glad if I\r\nmarried another.\u201d\r\n\r\nAn indignant reply was bursting from my lips, but he saw the rising\r\nstorm and hastened to allay it. He changed his tone at once from\r\nreproach to tender protestations.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt broke my heart to leave you as I did,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I could do no\r\nless. Sir Richard insisted on my accompanying him\u2014I was obliged to\r\ncomply. Even now he believes me to be in town. I have travelled all\r\nnight. He half-suspected me, because I refused to dine with him to-day;\r\nand I was forced to promise to join him at a ball to-night. I need not\r\nbe there till twelve or one, and so can stay two hours with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why this hurried journey?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy do you come?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe answered by pleading the vehemence of his affection, and spoke of the\r\nrisk he ran of losing me for ever. \u201cDo you not know,\u201d he said, \u201cthat my\r\nfather has set his heart upon your marrying my brother?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is very good,\u201d I replied disdainfully. \u201cBut I am not a slave, to be\r\nbought and sold. My cousin Clinton is the last person in the world whom\r\nyou need fear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Ellen, how much do you comfort\u2014transport me, by this generous\r\ncontempt for wealth and rank! You ask why I am here\u2014it were worth the\r\nfatigue, twice ten thousand times told, to have these assurances. I have\r\ntrembled\u2014I have feared\u2014but you will not love this favoured of\r\nfortune\u2014this elder son!\u201d\r\n\r\nI cannot describe Vernon\u2019s look as he said this. Methought envy, malice,\r\nand demoniac exultation were all mingled. He laughed aloud\u2014I shrunk from\r\nhim dismayed. He became calmer a moment after.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy life is in your hands, Ellen,\u201d he said;\u2014but why repeat his glossing\r\nspeeches, in which deceit and truth were so kneaded into one mass, that\r\nthe poison took the guise of the wholesome substance, while the whole\r\nwas impregnated with destruction. I felt that I liked him less than\r\never; yet I yielded to his violence. I believed myself the victim of a\r\nvenial but irreparable mistake of my own. I confirmed my promises, and\r\npledged my faith most solemnly. It is true that I undeceived him as much\r\nas I could with regard to the extent of my attachment; at first he was\r\nfurious at my coldness, then overwhelmed me with entreaties for\r\nforgiveness\u2014tears even streamed from his eyes\u2014and then again he\r\nhaughtily reminded me that I forfeited every virtue of my sex, and\r\nbecame a monument of falsehood, if I failed him. We separated at last\u2014I\r\npromised to write every day, and saw him ride away with a sensation as\r\nif relieved from the infliction of the torture.\r\n\r\nA week after this scene\u2014my spirits still depressed, and often weeping my\r\ndear father\u2019s death, which I considered the root of every evil\u2014I was\r\nreading, or rather trying to read, in my dressing-room, but in reality\r\nbrooding over my sorrows, when I heard Marianne\u2019s cheerful laugh in the\r\nshrubbery, and her voice calling me to join her. I roused myself from my\r\nsad reverie, and resolved to cast aside care and misery, while Vernon\u2019s\r\nabsence afforded me a shadow of freedom; and, in fulfilment of this\r\ndetermination, went down to join my young light-hearted cousin. She was\r\nnot alone. Clinton was with her. There was no resemblance between him\r\nand Vernon. His countenance was all sunshine; his light-blue eyes\r\nlaughed in their own gladness and purity; his beaming smile, his\r\nsilver-toned voice, his tall, manly figure, and, above all, his\r\nopen-hearted engaging manners, were all the reverse of his dark\r\nmysterious brother. I saw him, and felt that my prejudices had been\r\nridiculous; we became intimate in a moment. I know not how it was, but\r\nwe seemed like brother and sister\u2014each feeling, each thought, being laid\r\nbare to the other. I was naturally frank, but rendered timid by\r\neducation; so that it charmed me doubly when the unreserve of another\r\ninvited me to indulge in the unguarded confidence of my disposition. How\r\nspeedily the days now flew! they contained but one drawback, my\r\ncorrespondence with my cousin\u2014not that I felt myself unfaithful towards\r\nhim; my affection for my new-found relation did not disturb my\r\nconscience\u2014that was pure, undisguised, sisterly. We had met from across\r\nthe ocean of life\u2014two beings who formed a harmonized whole; but the\r\nsympathy was too perfect, too untinged by earthly dross, to be compared\r\nwith the selfish love given and exacted by Vernon. Yet I feared that his\r\njealousy might be awakened, while I felt less inclined than ever to\r\nbelie my own heart; and with aversion and hesitation penned letters\r\ncontaining the formula of affection and engaged vows.\r\n\r\nSir Richard came down to Beech Grove. He was highly pleased to see the\r\ncordial friendship that subsisted between his son and me.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid I not tell you that you would like him?\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery one must,\u201d I replied; \u201che is formed to win all hearts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd suits you much better than Vernon?\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not know what to answer; it was a tender string that he touched;\r\nbut I resolved not to feel or think. Sir Richard\u2019s were all flying\r\nvisits; he was to leave us in the evening. He had, during the morning, a\r\nlong conversation with Clinton; and immediately after he sought for an\r\nopportunity to talk to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cEllen,\u201d he said, \u201cI have not been a wise but I am a fond father. I have\r\ndone Clinton many injuries, of which he, poor fellow, is wholly\r\nunconscious; and I have wished to compensate for all in giving him a\r\nwife worthy of him. His temper is generous; his spirit clear and noble.\r\nBy my soul, I think he has every virtue under heaven; and you alone\r\ndeserve him. Do not interrupt me, I beseech you; hear me this once. I\r\nconfess that ever since you became my ward this has been my favourite\r\nproject. There have been several obstacles; but the most serious ones\r\nseem to vanish. You have seen each other, and I flatter myself have each\r\ndiscovered and appreciated the good qualities of the other. Is it so,\r\nEllen? I know not whence my fears arise, and yet they intrude\r\nthemselves. I fear, while I have been endeavouring to secure my boy\u2019s\r\nhappiness, I may have been adding to the ruin already heaped on his head\r\nby my means. I have talked with him to-day. He has no disguise in his\r\nnature, and he avows that he loves you. I know that this confession\r\nwould come better from himself; but your fortune, your beauty, make him\r\nfear to be misinterpreted. Do not mistake\u2014he is wholly unaware of my\r\nintention of speaking to you. I see your distress, dear Ellen; have\r\npatience but for one word more\u2014do not trifle with Clinton\u2019s feelings, as\r\nsometimes\u2014forgive me\u2014it has appeared to me that you have trifled with\r\nVernon\u2019s\u2014do not foster hopes not to be fulfilled. Be frank, be honest,\r\ndespite the bashfulness and coquetry of your sex.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter these words, fearful of having offended\u2014overcome by more agitation\r\nthan I could have imagined him capable of feeling\u2014my uncle drew me\r\ntowards him, pressed me convulsively to his bosom, and then rushed from\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nI cannot describe the state in which he left me\u2014a spasm of pain passed\r\nthrough my frame; I became sick and faint, till a flood of tears\r\nrelieved my bursting heart. I wept long\u2014I sobbed in agony\u2014I felt the\r\nveriest wretch that ever trod the earth.\r\n\r\nMy uncle had rent the veil that concealed me from myself. I loved\r\nClinton\u2014he was the whole world to me\u2014all the world of light and joy, and\r\nI had shut myself out from him for ever. And he also was my victim. I\r\nbeheld his dear face beaming with hope; I heard his thrilling voice\r\nharmonized by love; and saw the fearless cordiality of his manners,\r\nwhich bespoke his confidence in my sympathy; while I knew that I held a\r\npoisoned dagger which I was about to plunge into his heart. Sometimes I\r\nthought to treat him coldly, sometimes\u2014oh! I cannot tell the various\r\nimaginations that haunted me\u2014some self-sacrificing, others wicked and\r\nfalse\u2014all ended in one way. My uncle departed; we were left together,\r\nour full hearts beating to respond to each other without any division or\r\nreserve. I felt that every moment might cause Clinton to open his soul\r\nto me, and to seek in mine for a feeling too truly and too fondly alive\r\nthere, but which was sinful and fatal to both. To prevent his\r\nconfession, my own preceded it. I revealed to him my engagement to\r\nVernon, and declared my resolve not to swerve from my faith. He\r\ncommended me. I saw despair at losing me painted in his countenance,\r\nmingled with horror at supplanting his brother; and alarm that he, the\r\nelder born, gifted by fortune with every blessing, should be suspected\r\nof the intention of stealing the sole remaining good, which Vernon had\r\nwon by his diligence, perhaps by his deserts. Forbid it, Heaven! I saw\r\nin the clear mirror of his expressive countenance the struggle of\r\npassion and principle, and the triumph of honour and virtue exalted over\r\nthe truest love that ever warmed man\u2019s breast.\r\n\r\nOur gaiety was flown; our laughter stilled. We talked sadly and\r\nseriously together, neither lamenting our fate nor acknowledging our\r\nsufferings; tamed to endurance, and consoling each other by such\r\ndemonstrations of affection as were permitted to our near relationship.\r\nWe read clearly each other\u2019s hearts, and supported each other in the\r\njoint sacrifice; and this without any direct acknowledgment. Clinton\r\ntalked of returning to the Continent; I of my seclusion and tranquillity\r\nat Beech Grove. The time was distant\u2014two years was an eternity at our\r\nage\u2014before Vernon could claim my hand; and we did not advert to that\r\nfatal consummation. We gave up each other; and that single misery\r\nsufficed without a more cruel addition. I was calm, pale, and tearless.\r\nI had brought it all on myself, and must submit. I could not cast aside\r\nthe younger son to select the elder; and if in my secret thoughts I\r\ncherished a hope to induce Vernon to forego his claims, that very\r\ncircumstance would the more entirely divide me from Clinton. As my\r\nbrother-in-law, I might see him\u2014in some sort, our fortunes were shared;\r\nbut as a rival to Vernon, a stream of blood separated us for ever.\r\n\r\nThe hours of sad sympathy which we passed were very dear to us. We knew\r\nthat they were brief. Clinton had fixed the day and hour of his\r\ndeparture\u2014each moment it drew nearer. We should never meet again till\r\nafter my marriage; but till the hour of separation, for two short days,\r\nwe were all in all to each other, despite the wall of adamant which was\r\nraised between us. We tried each to pretend to think and talk of\r\nindifferent subjects; and we _never_ spoke of that nearest our\r\nhearts;\u2014but how superfluous are words as interpreters between lovers! As\r\nwe walked or rode, and spent hours in each other\u2019s society, we exchanged\r\nthoughts more intimately during long periods of absolute silence, than\r\nVernon with his vehemence and eloquence could have conceived. Had we\r\nspoken folio volumes, we could have said no more. Our looks\u2014the very\r\ncasting down of our eyes and mutual tacit avoidance, told our resolve to\r\nfulfil our duties and to conquer our love; and yet how, by a glance or a\r\nfaltering word, when the future was alluded to, did we promise never to\r\nforget, but to cherish mutual esteem and tenderness as all that was left\r\nof the paradise from which we were so ruthlessly driven! Now and then a\r\nplayful expression on his part, or a blush on mine, betrayed more\r\nfeeling than we considered right; the one was checked by a sigh, the\r\nother by an assumption of indifference.\r\n\r\nI had been spending many hours in tears and anguish, when, resolved to\r\novercome my weakness, and to recover an appearance of serenity before my\r\ncousin returned from his ride, I went into Marianne\u2019s schoolroom and\r\ntook up a book. The exhaustion of weeping had calmed me; and I thought\r\nof my kinsman\u2014his endearing qualities, and of the tie between us, with\r\nsoftened feelings. As I indulged in reverie, my head resting on my hand,\r\nmy book falling from my fingers, my eyes closed, I passed from the\r\nagitated sense of life and sorrow into the balmy forgetfulness of sleep.\r\nClinton had wished to make a portrait of me, yet had not ventured to ask\r\nme to sit\u2014he came in at this moment; Marianne, whispering, told him not\r\nto disturb me. He took her drawing materials, and made a hasty sketch,\r\nwhich genius and love united to render a perfect likeness. I awoke and\r\nsaw his work; it was beyond our contract; I asked him for it; he felt\r\nthat I was right, and gave it. This sacrifice on his part proved that he\r\ndid not palter with his sense of right. On the morrow we were to part;\r\nand he would preserve no memorial beyond a remembrance which he could\r\nnot destroy.\r\n\r\nThat morrow came. Clinton asked me and his sister to walk through the\r\npark with him, to join his chariot at the farther lodge. We consented;\r\nbut, at the moment of going, Marianne, who knew nothing certainly, but\r\nwho darkly guessed that all was not right, excused herself. I joined him\r\nalone. There was something in his person and manner that so promised\r\nprotection and tenderness, that I felt it doubly hard to be torn from\r\nhim. A dignified reserve, foreign to his usual nature, founded on a\r\nresolve to play only the brother\u2019s part, checked me somewhat; yet I\r\nloved him the more for it; while I would have laid down my existence so\r\nthat it had only been permitted us to throw aside the mask but for one\r\nshort hour, and to use the language of nature and troth. It could not\r\nbe; and our conversation was upon indifferent subjects. When we\r\napproached the lodge, we found that the chariot had not come, and we\r\nretreated a little, and sat down on a turfy bank; then Clinton said a\r\nfew words, the only ones that at all revealed the agitation he was\r\nenduring.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have a little more experience than you, Ellen,\u201d he said; \u201cand,\r\nbesides, I am haunted by strange presentiments; we seem to know what we\r\nought to do, and what we are to do, and act accordingly\u2014yet life is a\r\nstrange, wild thing. I wish to ensure for you a friend more willing and\r\nactive than Sir Richard. I have a sister to whom I am fondly attached;\r\nshe is now on the Continent, but I shall hasten to her, and entreat her\r\nto afford you a friendship you so richly deserve. You will love Lady\r\nHythe for her own sake as well as for mine.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was desirous of thanking him for this mark of kindness, but my voice\r\nfailed me, and I burst into tears, overcome by the excess of anguish\r\nthat deluged my heart I tried to conceal my tears\u2014I could not.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not, Ellen, dear Ellen, I beseech you\u2014command yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nClinton spoke in a voice so broken, so full of misery, that he inspired\r\nme at once with fear and courage. The tread of a horse roused us\u2014a horse\r\nat swift gallop. I raised my eyes, and uttered a shriek; for, reining in\r\nthe animal with a sudden strong pull, Vernon halted close to us. The\r\nmost violent passions convulsed his countenance. He threw himself from\r\nthe horse, and, casting the bridle from him, came up. What he meant to\r\nsay or do I cannot tell; perhaps to conceal the workings of his\r\nheart\u2014and the quick departure of Clinton would have smoothed all; but I\r\nsaw the barrel of a pistol peep from the pocket of his coat. I was\r\nseized with terror\u2014I shrieked aloud. Clinton, terrified at my alarm,\r\nwould have supported me, but Vernon pushed him rudely away.\r\n\r\n\u201cDare not to approach or touch her, as you value your life!\u201d he cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy life! you talk idly, Vernon. I value her security\u2014one moment of\r\npeace to her\u2014far more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou confess it!\u201d exclaimed Vernon; \u201cand you, too, false and treacherous\r\ngirl! Ha! did you think to betray me, and be unpunished? Do you think,\r\nif I so chose it, that I would not force you to look on till the blood\r\nof one of the brothers flowed at your feet? But there are other\r\npunishments in store for you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe expressions of menace used towards myself restored my courage, and I\r\nexclaimed, \u201cBeware that you do not break the tie that binds us\u2014at least,\r\nthat bound us a moment ago\u2014perhaps it is already broken.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoubtless,\u201d he cried, grinding his teeth with rage, \u201cit is broken, and\r\na new one created to bind you to the elder son. Oh yes! you would fain\r\ncast aside the poor, miserable beggar, who has vainly fawned on you, and\r\nmadly loved\u2014you would take the rich, the honourable, and honoured Sir\r\nClinton! Base, hollow-hearted fool!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVernon,\u201d said Clinton, \u201cwhatever your claims are on our cousin, I\r\ncannot stand by and see her insulted. You forget yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe forgetfulness, sir, is on your part; proud in your seniority, to\r\nrival your brother, to drive him from his all, has been a May-game for\r\nyou; but know, proud fool, or villain\u2014take which name you will\u2014your hour\r\nis passed by\u2014your reign at an end! Your station is a fiction, your very\r\nexistence a disgrace!\u201d\r\n\r\nClinton and I both began to think that Vernon was really mad\u2014a suspicion\r\nconfirmed by his violent gestures. We looked at each other in alarm.\r\n\r\n\u201cStay!\u201d exclaimed the infuriated man, seizing my arm with a fierce\r\ngrasp; while, fearful to induce Clinton\u2019s interference, I yielded.\r\n\u201cStay, and listen to what your lover is\u2014or shall I wound your delicate\r\nears? There are soft phrases and silken words to adorn that refuse of\r\nthe world\u2014a bastard!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVernon, dare not!\u2014beware, sir, and begone!\u201d\r\n\r\nClinton\u2019s face crimsoned; his voice, his majestic indignation almost\r\nforced the ruffian to quail; he threw my arm from him.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake him, fair Ellen! it is true you take what I say\u2014a natural son. Do\r\nyou think that my information is not correct? Ask our father, for he is\r\nyours, Clinton, and our mother is the same; you are the first-born of\r\nRichard Gray and Matilda Towers; but I am the eldest son of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nGray.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt could not have been that Vernon would have acted this cowardly and\r\nfoolish part had he not been driven by a kind of madness. In truth, Sir\r\nRichard had, to quench his hopes for ever, with that carelessness of\r\ntruth\u2014his fatal propensity\u2014affirmed that Clinton and I were acknowledged\r\nlovers; and he came goaded by worse than jealousy\u2014by a spirit of hatred\r\nand revenge. Seeing us together, obviously engaged by the most\r\nengrossing feelings, his temper, which had been worked into fury during\r\nhis journey, burst forth beyond the bounds he had prescribed for\r\nhimself. I have called him a serpent, and such he was in every respect;\r\nhe could crawl and coil, and hide his wily advance; but he could erect\r\nhis crest, dart out his forked tongue, and infix the deadly venom, when\r\nroused as he now was. Clinton turned alternately pale and red.\r\n\r\n\u201cBe it as you will,\u201d he said; \u201cmy fortunes and yours are of slight\r\nmoment in comparison to Ellen\u2019s safety. If there is any truth in this\r\ntale of yours, there will be time enough to discover it and to act upon\r\nit. Meanwhile, dear cousin, I see they have brought my chariot to the\r\nlodge. You cannot walk home\u2014get into it; it will drive you to the house,\r\nand come back for me.\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked at him inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not fear to be deserted by me,\u201d he said, \u201cor that I shall do\r\nanything rashly. Vernon must accompany me to town\u2014to our father\u2019s\r\npresence, there to expiate this foul calumny, or to prove it. Be assured\r\nhe shall not approach you without your leave. I will watch over him, and\r\nguard you.\u201d\r\n\r\nClinton spoke aloud, and Vernon became aware that he must yield to this\r\narrangement, and satisfied that he had divided us. Clinton led me to his\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will hear soon from some one of us, Ellen,\u201d he said; \u201cand let me\r\nimplore you to be patient\u2014to take care of yourself\u2014to fear nothing. I\r\ncan make no remark\u2014affirm, deny nothing now; but you shall not be kept\r\nin suspense. Promise me to be patient and calm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd do you,\u201d I said at last, commanding my trembling voice, \u201cpromise\r\nnot to be rash; and promise not to leave England without seeing me\r\nagain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI promise not to leave England for any time without your leave. Oh,\r\ntrust me, my dear cousin; it is not in such storms as these that you\r\nshall be ashamed of me; one sentiment may subdue me, but poverty,\r\ndisgrace, and every angry passion I can master.\u201d\r\n\r\nVernon did not dare interrupt us. He felt that he had destroyed his\r\ncarefully woven web through his own rashness, and gnawed his lips in\r\nsilent rage. I looked at him once, and turned away my eyes in contempt.\r\nI got into the chariot; it drove me to the house, and went back to take\r\nClinton up to town. Thus we were separated, as we intended; and yet, how\r\ndifferently! Hope was reborn in my heart, out of the very ashes of its\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nTwo mortal days passed, and I was still in my solitude, receiving no\r\nintelligence, except, indeed, such as was contained in a letter from\r\nVernon. In this he demanded me as a right, and fiercely insisted that I\r\nshould keep my faith with him; but he did not allude to the scene in the\r\npark, nor to his strange assertions there. I threw the letter from me as\r\nunworthy of notice or thought. The third morning brought me one from my\r\nuncle. I tore it open with uncontrollable impatience: these were the\r\ncontents:\u2014\r\n\r\n    \u201cClinton, my dear Ellen, insists that I should join you at Beech\r\n    Grove; but I cannot persuade myself to do so till I have your\r\n    leave\u2014till I have confessed my villainy, and besought your\r\n    forgiveness, in addition to that of my noble-hearted boy, whom I\r\n    devoted to ruin before his birth, and who has pardoned me. It is a\r\n    hateful subject\u2014unfit for your ears, my gentle, virtuous girl, and I\r\n    must hurry it over. When I first knew Miss Towers, I had no idea of\r\n    marrying her; for she was poor and of humble birth. We loved each\r\n    other, and she was willing to become mine on my own terms. Our\r\n    intercourse was betrayed to her parents; and to appease them, and\r\n    please Matilda, I declared that we were married. My assertion was\r\n    credited; Matilda assumed my name, and all the world, all her little\r\n    world, was deceived; while at the same time I declared to my father\r\n    that she was merely my mistress. He did not believe me. Thus I\r\n    became entangled. A little before the birth of our second boy my\r\n    father died, and my grandfather offered me two thousand a year on\r\n    condition that I would secure the whole estate to my eldest son. I\r\n    loved Matilda; my fears were dissipated by my father\u2019s death, and by\r\n    this acknowledgment of my union by my grandfather. I married her;\r\n    and, three days after Vernon\u2019s birth, signed the settlement of\r\n    entail. Such is my story. Lady Gray\u2019s character necessitated the\r\n    concealment from every human being of the period when the marriage\r\n    was celebrated. My noble, beloved Clinton assumed the elder son\u2019s\r\n    place. I dared not reveal the truth; nay, I fancied that I benefited\r\n    him by allowing him to fill this false position till my death. He\r\n    has undeceived me; but he has not cursed me. From the moment I saw\r\n    you, I designed that you should repair my faults towards him, as you\r\n    alone could. I believed that you were formed for each other; I was\r\n    not mistaken there. I meant to acknowledge all before your marriage,\r\n    but I believed that if once your affections were engaged, you would\r\n    not reject my son from base and worldly-minded considerations. Am I\r\n    not right also in this? Meanwhile, Clinton was abroad, and I became\r\n    uneasy at observing the pains which Vernon took to ingratiate\r\n    himself with you, and the intimacy which you encouraged. I forbade\r\n    him to remain with you at Beech Grove\u2014he defied me. Then I tried to\r\n    entice him away from you; and, as a last bribe, disclosed the secret\r\n    of his birth: he, in return, promised to leave the field open to\r\n    Clinton. You know the rest. He never meant to give you up; he was my\r\n    heir, and he grasped at your fortune besides\u2014shall he succeed?\r\n    Clinton is all kindness, and soothing angelic goodness\u2014but he\r\n    insists on no longer filling a situation to which he has no claim,\r\n    and\u2014is gone abroad. He fears to leave you exposed to Vernon\u2019s\r\n    violence, and has made me promise to go down to Beech Grove, and to\r\n    prevent his brother from seeing you without your free and entire\r\n    consent. As I have said, I cannot prevail on myself to visit you\r\n    till you are in full possession of all the facts. Now they are in\r\n    your hands. You may expect me to-morrow. Do not fear Vernon; I will\r\n    take care that he shall not commit further outrage on you, nor\r\n    injure the interest which I fondly trust that you preserve for my\r\n    godlike, my beloved Clinton.\u201d\r\n\r\nI read and reread this letter a thousand times; my soul was in tumults.\r\nAt first I could only think of the facts that it contained, and proudly\r\nand joyfully determined to compensate to Clinton, as I believed I could,\r\nfor every evil; and then again I read the letter, and many parts of it\r\nfilled me with wonder and dismay. Clinton was gone abroad\u2014against his\r\npromise\u2014without a word; and there was something so indelicate in the way\r\nin which my uncle espoused his cause. It was strange\u2014unlike any conduct\r\nI had expected on my dear cousin\u2019s part. Of course he would write\u2014and\r\nyet he was gone, and no letter came! And then I dreaded to see Sir\r\nRichard, the wrongful, penitent father: the total indifference which he\r\ndisplayed to moral principle\u2014not founded, like Vernon\u2019s, on selfishness,\r\nbut on weakness of character and natural callousness to truth\u2014revolted\r\nme. Where was my own dear father? He had thrown me from the sacred\r\nshelter of his virtue into a system of dissimulation and guilt, which\r\neven Clinton, I thought, deserting me as he did, did not redeem. I\r\nstruggled with these feelings, but their justice confounded and overcame\r\nme. Yet, even in the midst of these disquieting reflections, a deep\r\nsense of happiness pervaded my soul. The mystery, the tyranny which had\r\nenveloped me, was brushed away like a spider\u2019s web. I was free\u2014I might\r\nfollow the dictates of my feelings, and it was no longer sin to love him\r\nto whom my heart was irrevocably given. The hours of the day flew on,\r\nwhile I lived as in a dream, absorbed by wonder, hope, doubt, and joy.\r\nAt length, at six in the evening, a carriage drove up the avenue; a kind\r\nof terror at the expectation of seeing my uncle seized me, and I\r\nretreated hastily to my own room, gasping for breath. In a few minutes\r\nmy servant tapped at my door; she told me that it was Lady Hythe who had\r\narrived, and delivered me a letter. The letter was from Clinton; it was\r\ndated the same day, in London. I pressed it passionately to my lips and\r\nheart, and devoured its contents with eagerness. \u201cAt length, dear\r\nEllen,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI am satisfied; I was long uneasy on your account. I\r\nbesought my father to go down to you, yet even that did not content\r\nme\u2014for you did not so much need protection as sympathy and true\r\ndisinterested friendship. My thoughts turned towards my earliest and\r\ndearest friend, my sister Caroline. She was on the Continent\u2014I set out\r\nimmediately to meet her, to tell everything, and to ask her advice and\r\nassistance. Fortune befriended me\u2014I found her at Calais\u2014she is now with\r\nyou. She is my better self. Her delicacy of character, her accurate\r\njudgment and warm heart, joined to her position as a woman, married to\r\nthe best and most generous fellow breathing, render her the very person\r\nto whom I can intrust your happiness. I do not speak of myself\u2014fortune\r\ncannot overcome my spirits, and my way is clear before me. I pity my\r\nfather and family; but Caroline will explain to you better than I can my\r\nviews and hopes. Adieu, dear cousin! Heaven bless you as you deserve!\r\nYour fortitude, I am sure, has not deserted you; yet I am very anxious\r\nto hear that your health has not suffered by my brother\u2019s violence.\r\nCaroline will write to me, and rejoice me by telling me of your\r\nwell-being.\u201d\r\n\r\nI hurried down immediately to welcome Clinton\u2019s sister; and from that\r\nmoment my perplexities and sorrows vanished. Lady Hythe was a feminine\r\nlikeness of Clinton; the same active kindness of heart, gentleness of\r\ntemper, and adorable frankness. We were friends and sisters on the\r\ninstant, and her true affection repaid me for every suffering; none of\r\nwhich I should have experienced had she been in England on my arrival.\r\nClinton had told her of his love, but left me to reveal my own\r\nsentiments, detailing only the artifices and jealousy of Vernon. I was\r\nwithout disguise, for we were all one family, with the same objects,\r\nhopes, and pleasures. We went up to town immediately, and there I saw\r\nClinton, and we exchanged our reserved, sad intercourse for a full\r\nacknowledgment of every thought and feeling.\r\n\r\nThe only piece of prudence that Sir Richard had practised was placing\r\nClinton in the army, and purchasing promotion for him. He was so beloved\r\nby his fellow-officers that, on the discovery of his unfortunate birth,\r\nthey all united in giving him the support of their friendship and good\r\nopinion. Clinton resolved, therefore, to enter at once on active\r\nservice, and to follow up his profession with energy. Two years were to\r\nelapse before I could marry, and he expressed a wish that we should\r\nneither of us consider ourselves under any engagement. How vain are such\r\nwords! Heaven designed us for each other, and the mere phrase of\r\nengagement or freedom could not affect a tie founded on affection,\r\nesteem, or, beyond this, the passion that caused us to find happiness in\r\neach other only. He went with his regiment to Ireland, and we were a\r\ngood deal divided during the two years that elapsed before I was\r\ntwenty-one. I continued to reside with Lady Hythe, and enjoyed with her\r\nthat peace of mind which true friendship affords.\r\n\r\nAt length the day came when I completed my twenty-first year. Sir\r\nRichard had wished to be present at our nuptials, but was unable from\r\nill-health. I went to him, and saw him for the first time since the\r\nfatal discovery; for, on finding that I was happily placed with his\r\ndaughter, he had carefully avoided seeing me. His character, indeed, was\r\nwholly changed. While carrying on a system of dissimulation, he had\r\nappeared gay; he was extravagant; given up to pleasure, and spending\r\neven beyond his large income, despite the ruin in which he knew that his\r\nson would be involved on his death. He made him indeed a princely\r\nallowance, as if that was to compensate to him; while, in fact, Clinton\r\nwas only thus habituated to expense. As soon as the discovery was made,\r\nSir Richard, by one of those inconceivable changes which sometimes occur\r\nin the history of human nature, set his heart on saving a fortune for\r\nhis beloved boy. He thought that I might be fickle; he feared his own\r\ndeath and the loss of power to benefit him. He gave up his establishment\r\nin town\u2014he let Beech Grove\u2014he saved every farthing that he could, and\r\nwas enabled to settle twenty thousand pounds on Clinton on the day of\r\nour marriage.\r\n\r\nI went to see him in a little lodging at Camberwell, whither he had\r\nretreated. He was emaciated and ill; his eyes brightened a little on\r\nseeing Clinton and me together.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would fain live a little longer,\u201d he said, \u201cto increase my son\u2019s\r\nfortune; but God\u2019s will be done\u2014you will make him happy, Ellen.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe were inexpressibly shocked. He had concealed his penurious style of\r\nlife and declining health all this time; and nothing but his illness,\r\nand our insisting upon seeing him, caused him to betray it now. Our\r\nfirst care after our marriage was to oblige him to take up his abode\r\nwith us; and we devoted ourselves to calming his remorse and smoothing\r\nhis path to the grave. He survived only four months; but he had the\r\ncomfort of knowing that Clinton was satisfied and happy; and that we\r\nboth from our hearts forgave the errors which he at last expiated so\r\ndearly.\r\n\r\nWe never saw Vernon again; nor can I tell what has happened to him,\r\nexcept that he lives the life of the rich in England, apparently\r\nattended by prosperity. Lady Hythe stood between me and him, and\r\nscreened me from his violence and reproaches. He has never married. I\r\nhave never seen him since the day when, in the park at Beech Grove, he\r\nunawares conferred on me every blessing of life, by releasing me from\r\nthe ties that bound me to him.\r\n\r\nThe happiness of Clinton and myself has been unclouded. I at last\r\npersuaded him to give up his profession, and we live principally abroad.\r\nLord and Lady Hythe frequently visit us; and every event of our\r\nlives\u2014the unimportant events of domestic life\u2014tends to increase our\r\nprosperity, and the entire affection we cherish for each other.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XVII.\r\n\r\n                            _THE PILGRIMS._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE twilight of one of those burning days of summer whose unclouded sky\r\nseems to speak to man of happier realms, had already flung broad shadows\r\nover the valley of Unspunnen; whilst the departing rays of a gorgeous\r\nsunset continued to glitter on the summits of the surrounding hills.\r\nGradually, however, the glowing tints deepened; then grew darker and\r\ndarker; until they finally yielded to the still more sober hues of\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nBeneath an avenue of lime-trees, which, from their size and luxuriance,\r\nappeared almost coeval with the soil in which they grew, Burkhardt of\r\nUnspunnen wandered to and fro with uneasy step, as if some recent sorrow\r\noccupied his troubled mind. At times he stood with his eyes stedfastly\r\nfixed on the earth, as if he expected to see the object of his\r\ncontemplation start forth from its bosom; at other times he would raise\r\nhis eyes to the summits of the trees, whose branches, now gently\r\nagitated by the night breeze, seemed to breathe sighs of compassion in\r\nremembrance of those happy hours which had once been passed beneath\r\ntheir welcome shade. When, however, advancing from beneath them, he\r\nbeheld the deep blue heavens with the bright host of stars, hope sprang\r\nup within him at the thoughts of that glory to which those heavens and\r\nthose stars, all lovely and beauteous as they seem, are but the faint\r\nheralds, and for a time dissipated the grief which had so long weighed\r\nheavily upon his heart.\r\n\r\nFrom these reflections he was suddenly aroused by the tones of a manly\r\nvoice addressing him. Burkhardt advancing, beheld, standing in the light\r\nof the moon, two pilgrims, clothed in the usual coarse and sombre garb,\r\nwith their broad hats drawn over their brows.\r\n\r\n\u201cPraise be to God!\u201d said the pilgrim who had just before awakened\r\nBurkhardt\u2019s attention, and who, from his height and manner, appeared to\r\nbe the elder of the two. His words were echoed by a voice whose gentle\r\nand faultering accents showed the speaker to be still but of tender\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhither are you going, friends? what seek you here, at this late hour?\u201d\r\nsaid Burkhardt. \u201cIf you wish to rest you after your journey enter, and\r\nwith God\u2019s blessing, and my hearty welcome, recruit yourselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNoble sir, you have more than anticipated our petition,\u201d replied the\r\nelder pilgrim; \u201cour duty has led us far from our native land, being\r\nbound on a pilgrimage to fulfil the vow of a beloved parent. We have\r\nbeen forced during the heat of the day to climb the steep mountain\r\npaths; and the strength of my brother, whose youth but ill befits him\r\nfor such fatigues, began to fail, when the sight of your castle\u2019s\r\ntowers, which the moon\u2019s clear beams discovered to us, revived our\r\nhopes. We resolved to beg a night\u2019s lodging under your hospitable roof,\r\nthat we might be enabled, on to-morrow\u2019s dawn, to pursue our weary way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFollow me, my friends,\u201d said Burkhardt, as he, with quickened step,\r\npreceded them, that he might give some orders for their entertainment\r\nThe pilgrims rejoicing in so kind a reception, followed the knight in\r\nsilence into a high-vaulted saloon, over which the tapers that were\r\nplaced in branches against the walls cast a solemn but pleasing light,\r\nwell in accordance with the present feelings of the parties.\r\n\r\nThe knight then discerned two countenances, the pleasing impression of\r\nwhich was considerably heightened by the modest yet easy manner with\r\nwhich the youthful pair received their host\u2019s kind attentions. Much\r\nstruck with their appearance and demeanour, Burkhardt was involuntarily\r\nled back into the train of thoughts from which their approach had\r\naroused him; and the scenes of former days flitted before him as he\r\nrecollected that in this hall his beloved child was ever wont to greet\r\nhim with her welcome smile on his return from the battle or the chase;\r\nbrief scenes of happiness, which had been followed by events that had\r\ncankered his heart, and rendered memory but an instrument of bitterness\r\nand chastisement.\r\n\r\nSupper was soon after served, and the pilgrims were supplied with the\r\ngreatest attention, yet conversation wholly languished; for his\r\nmelancholy reflections occupied Burkhardt, and respect, or perhaps a\r\nmore kindly feeling, towards their host and benefactor, seemed to have\r\nsealed the lips of his youthful guests. After supper, however, a flask\r\nof the baron\u2019s old wine cheered his flagging spirits, and emboldened the\r\nelder pilgrim to break through the spell which had chained them.\r\n\r\n\u201cPardon me, noble sir,\u201d said he, \u201cfor I feel it must seem intrusive in\r\nme to seek the cause of that sorrow which renders you so sad a spectator\r\nof the bounty and happiness which you liberally bestow upon others.\r\nBelieve me, it is not the impulse of a mere idle curiosity that makes me\r\nexpress my wonder that you can thus dwell alone in this spacious and\r\nnoble mansion, the prey to a deeply-rooted sorrow. Would that it were in\r\nour power to alleviate the cares of one who with such bounteous hand\r\nrelieves the wants of his poorer brethren!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thank you for your sympathy, good pilgrim,\u201d said the old noble, \u201cbut\r\nwhat can it avail you to know the story of those griefs which have made\r\nthis earth a desert? and which are, with rapid pace, conducting me where\r\nalone I can expect to find rest. Spare me, then, the pain of recalling\r\nscenes which I would fain bury in oblivion. As yet, you are in the\r\nspring of life, when no sad remembrance gives a discordant echo of past\r\nfollies, or of joys irrecoverably lost. Seek not to darken the sunshine\r\nof your youth with a knowledge of those fierce, guilty beings who, in\r\nlistening to the fiend-like suggestions of their passions, are led\r\nastray from the paths of rectitude, and tear asunder the ties of\r\nnature.\u201d\r\n\r\nBurkhardt thus sought to avoid the entreaty of the pilgrim. But the\r\nrequest was still urged with such earnest though delicate persuasion,\r\nand the rich tones of the stranger\u2019s voice awoke within him so many\r\nthoughts of days long, long past, that the knight felt himself almost\r\nirresistibly impelled to unburden his long-closed heart to one who\r\nseemed to enter into its feelings with a sincere cordiality.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour artless sympathy has won my confidence, my young friends,\u201d said\r\nhe, \u201cand you shall learn the cause of my sorrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see me here, lonely and forsaken. But fortune once looked upon me\r\nwith her blandest smiles; and I felt myself rich in the consciousness of\r\nmy prosperity, and the gifts which bounteous Heaven had bestowed. My\r\npowerful vassals made me a terror to those enemies which the protection\r\nthat I was ever ready to afford to the oppressed and helpless brought\r\nagainst me. My broad and fertile possessions enabled me, with liberal\r\nhand, to relieve the wants of the poor, and to exercise the rights of\r\nhospitality in a manner becoming my state and my name. But of all the\r\ngifts which Heaven had showered upon me, that which I most prized was a\r\nwife, whose virtues had made her the idol of both the rich and the poor.\r\nBut she who was already an angel, and unfitted for this grosser world,\r\nwas too soon, alas! claimed by her kindred spirits. One brief year alone\r\nhad beheld our happiness.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy grief and anguish were most bitter, and would soon have laid me in\r\nthe same grave with her, but that she had left me a daughter, for whose\r\ndear sake I struggled earnestly against my affliction. In her were now\r\ncentred all my cares, all my hopes, all my happiness. As she grew in\r\nyears, so did her likeness to her sainted mother increase; and every\r\nlook and gesture reminded me of my Agnes. With her mother\u2019s beauty I\r\nhad, with fond presumption, dared to cherish the hope that Ida would\r\ninherit her mother\u2019s virtues.\r\n\r\n\u201cGreatly did I feel the void that my irreparable loss had made; but the\r\nvery thought of marrying again seemed to me a profanation. If, however,\r\neven for a single instant I had entertained this disposition, one look\r\nat our child would have crushed it, and made me cling with still fonder\r\nhope to her, in the fond confidence that she would reward me for every\r\nsacrifice that I could make. Alas! my friends, this hope was built on an\r\nunsure foundation! and my heart is even now tortured when I think on\r\nthose delusive dreams.\r\n\r\n\u201cIda, with the fondest caresses, would dispel each care from my brow; in\r\nsickness and in health she watched me with the tenderest solicitude; her\r\nwhole endeavour seemed to be to anticipate my wishes. But, alas! like\r\nthe serpent, which only fascinates to destroy, she lavished these\r\ncaresses and attentions to blind me, and wrap me in fatal security.\r\n\r\n\u201cMany and deep were the affronts, revenged indeed, but not forgotten,\r\nwhich had long since caused (with shame I avow it) a deadly hatred\r\nbetween myself and Rupert, Lord of W\u00e4dischwyl, which the slightest\r\noccasion seemed to increase to a degree of madness. As he dared no\r\nlonger throw down the gauntlet, he found means, much harder than steel\r\nor iron, to glut his revenge upon me.\r\n\r\n\u201cDuke Berchtold of Z\u00e4hringen, one of those wealthy and powerful tyrants\r\nwho are the very pests of that society of whose rights they ought to be\r\nthe ready guardians, had made a sudden irruption on the peaceful\r\ninhabitants of the mountains, seizing their herds and flocks, and\r\ninsulting their wives and daughters. Though possessed of great courage,\r\nyet being not much used to warfare, these unhappy men found it\r\nimpossible to resist the tyrant, and hastened to entreat my instant\r\nsuccour. Without a moment\u2019s delay, I assembled my brave vassals, and\r\nmarched against the spoiler. After a long and severe struggle, God\r\nblessed our cause, and our victory was complete.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the morning that I was to depart on my return to my castle, one of\r\nmy followers announced to me that the duke had arrived in my camp, and\r\nwished an immediate interview with me. I instantly went forth to meet\r\nhim; and Berchtold, hastening towards me with a smile, offered me his\r\nhand in token of reconciliation. I frankly accepted it, not suspecting\r\nthat falsehood could lurk beneath so open and friendly an aspect.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My friend,\u2019 said he, \u2018for such I must call you; your valour in this\r\ncontest has won my esteem, although I could at once convince you that I\r\nhave just cause of quarrel with the insolent mountaineers. But, in spite\r\nof your victory in this unjust strife, into which doubtless you were\r\ninduced to enter by the misrepresentations of those villains, yet as my\r\nnature abhors to prolong dissensions, I would willingly cease to think\r\nthat we are enemies, and commence a friendship which, on my part, at\r\nleast, shall not be broken. In token, therefore, that you do not\r\nmistrust a fellow-soldier, return with me to my castle, that we may\r\nthere drown all remembrance of our past dissensions.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cDuring a long time I resisted his importunity, for I had now been more\r\nthan a year absent from my home, and was doubly impatient to return, as\r\nI fondly imagined that my delay would occasion much anxiety to my\r\ndaughter. But the duke, with such apparent kindness and in such a\r\ncourteous manner, renewed and urged his solicitations, that I could\r\nresist no longer.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis Highness entertained me with the greatest hospitality and\r\nunremitted attention. But I soon perceived that an _honest_ man is more\r\nin his element amidst the toils of the battle than amongst the\r\nblandishments of a Court, where the lip and the gesture carry welcome,\r\nbut where the heart, to which the tongue is never the herald, is\r\ncorroded by the unceasing strifes of jealousy and envy. I soon, too, saw\r\nthat my rough and undisguised manners were an occasion of much mirth to\r\nthe perfumed and essenced nothings who crowded the halls of the duke. I\r\nhowever stifled my resentment, when I considered that these creatures\r\nlived but in his favour, like those swarms of insects which are warmed\r\ninto existence from the dunghill, by the sun\u2019s rays.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had remained the unwilling guest of the duke during some days, when\r\nthe arrival of a stranger of distinction was announced with much\r\nceremony; this stranger I found to be my bitterest foe, Rupert of\r\nW\u00e4dischwyl. The duke received him with the most marked politeness and\r\nattention, and more than once I fancied that I perceived the precedence\r\nof me was studiously given to my enemy. My frank yet haughty nature\r\ncould ill brook this disparagement; and, besides, it seemed to me that I\r\nshould but play the hypocrite if I partook of the same cup with the man\r\nfor whom I entertained a deadly hatred.\r\n\r\n\u201cI resolved therefore to depart, and sought his Highness to bid him\r\nfarewell. He appeared much distressed at my resolution, and earnestly\r\npressed me to avow the cause of my abrupt departure. I candidly\r\nconfessed that the undue favour which I thought he showed to my rival,\r\nwas the cause.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am hurt, deeply hurt,\u2019 said the duke, affecting an air of great\r\nsorrow, \u2018that my friend, and that friend the valiant Unspunnen, should\r\nthink thus unjustly, dare I add, thus meanly of me. No, I have not even\r\nin thought wronged you; and to prove my sincerity and my regard for your\r\nwelfare, know that it was not chance which conducted your adversary to\r\nmy court. He comes in consequence of my eager wish to reconcile two men\r\nwhom I so much esteem, and whose worth and excellence place them amongst\r\nthe brightest ornaments of our favoured land. Let me, therefore,\u2019 said\r\nhe, taking my hand and the hand of Rupert, who had entered during our\r\ndiscourse, \u2018let me have the satisfaction of reconciling two such men,\r\nand of terminating your ancient discord. You cannot refuse a request so\r\ncongenial to that holy faith which we all profess. Suffer me therefore\r\nto be the minister of peace, and to suggest that, in token and in\r\nconfirmation of an act which will draw down Heaven\u2019s blessing on us all,\r\nyou will permit our holy Church to unite in one your far-famed lovely\r\ndaughter with Lord Rupert\u2019s only son, whose virtues, if reports speak\r\ntruly, render him no undeserving object of her love.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cA rage, which seemed in an instant to turn my blood into fire, and\r\nwhich almost choked my utterance, took possession of me.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What!\u2019 exclaimed I, \u2018what, think you that I would thus sacrifice,\r\n_thus_ cast away my precious jewel! thus debase my beloved Ida? No, by\r\nher sainted mother, I swear that rather than see her married to _his_\r\nson, I would devote her to the cloister! Nay, I would rather see her\r\ndead at my feet than suffer her purity to be sullied by such\r\ncontamination!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018But for the presence of his Highness,\u2019 cried Rupert wrathfully, \u2018your\r\nlife should instantly answer for this insult! Nathless, I will well mark\r\nyou, and watch you, too, my lord; and if you escape my revenge, you are\r\nmore than man.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Indeed, indeed, my Lord of Unspunnen,\u2019 said the duke, \u2018you are much\r\ntoo rash. Your passion has clouded your reason; and, believe me, you\r\nwill live to repent having so scornfully refused my friendly proposal.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You may judge me rash, my Lord Duke, and perhaps think me somewhat too\r\nbold, because I dare assert the truth in the courts of princes. But\r\nsince my tongue cannot frame itself to speak that which my heart does\r\nnot dictate, and my plain but honest manner seems to displease you, I\r\nwill, with your Highness\u2019s permission, withdraw to my own domain, whence\r\nI have been but too long absent.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Undoubtedly, my lord, you have my permission,\u2019 said the duke\r\nhaughtily, and at the same time turning coldly from me.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy horse was brought, I mounted him with as much composure as I could\r\ncommand, and I breathed more freely as I left the castle far behind.\r\n\r\n\u201cDuring the second day\u2019s journey I arrived within a near view of my own\r\nnative mountains, and I felt doubly invigorated as their pure breezes\r\nwere wafted towards me. Still the fond anxiety of a father for his\r\nbeloved child, and that child his only treasure, made the way seem\r\ndoubly long. But as I approached the turn of the road which is\r\nimmediately in front of my castle, I almost then wished the way\r\nlengthened; for my joy, my hopes, and my apprehensions crowded upon me\r\nalmost to suffocation. \u2018A few short minutes, however,\u2019 I thought, \u2018and\r\nthen the truth, ill or good, will be known to me.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I came in full sight of my dwelling, all seemed in peace; nought\r\nexhibited any change since I had left it. I spurred my horse on to the\r\ngate, but as I advanced the utter stillness and desertion of all around\r\nsurprised me. Not a domestic, not a peasant, was to be seen in the\r\ncourts; it appeared as if the inhabitants of the castle were still\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Merciful Heaven!\u2019 I thought, \u2018what can this stillness forebode! Is\r\nshe, is my beloved child dead?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI could not summon courage to pull the bell. Thrice I attempted, yet\r\nthrice the dread of learning the awful truth prevented me. One moment,\r\none word, even one sign, and I might be a forlorn, childless, wretched\r\nman, for ever! None but a father can feel or fully sympathize in the\r\nagony of those moments! none but a father can ever fitly describe them!\r\n\r\n\u201cI was aroused from this inactive state by my faithful dog springing\r\ntowards me to welcome my return with his boisterous caresses, and deep\r\nand loud-toned expressions of his joy. Then the old porter, attracted by\r\nthe noise, came to the gate, which he instantly opened; but, as he was\r\nhurrying forward to meet me, I readily perceived that some sudden and\r\npainful recollection checked his eagerness. I leaped from my horse\r\nquickly, and entered the hall. All the other domestics now came forward,\r\nexcept my faithful steward Wilfred, he who had been always the foremost\r\nto greet his master.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where is my daughter? where is your mistress?\u2019 I eagerly exclaimed;\r\n\u2018let me but know that she lives!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe faithful Wilfred, who had now entered the hall, threw himself at my\r\nfeet, and with the tears rolling down his furrowed cheeks, earnestly\r\npressed my hand, and hesitatingly informed me that my daughter _lived_:\r\nwas well, he believed, but\u2014had quitted the castle.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Now, speak more quickly, old man,\u2019 said I hastily, and passionately\r\ninterrupting him. \u2018What is it you can mean? my daughter lives; my Ida is\r\nwell, but she is _not here_. Now, have you and my vassals proved\r\nrecreants, and suffered my castle in my absence to be robbed of its\r\ngreatest treasure? Speak! speak plainly, I command ye!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is with anguish, as great almost as your own can be, my beloved\r\nmaster, that I make known to you the sad truth that your daughter has\r\nquitted her father\u2019s roof to become the wife of Conrad, the son of the\r\nLord of W\u00e4dischwyl.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The wife of Lord Rupert\u2019s son! my Ida the wife of the son of him whose\r\nvery name my soul loathes!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cMy wrath now knew no bounds; the torments of hell seemed to have\r\nchanged the current of my blood. In the madness of my passion I even\r\ncursed my own dear daughter! Yes, pilgrim, I even cursed her on whom I\r\nso fondly doted; for whose sake alone life for me had any charms. Oh!\r\nhow often since have I attempted to recall that curse! and these bitter\r\ntears, which even now I cannot control, witness how severe has been my\r\nrepentance of that awful and unnatural act!\r\n\r\n\u201cDreadful were the imprecations which I heaped upon my enemy; and deep\r\nwas the revenge I swore. I know not to what fearful length my unbridled\r\npassion would have hurried me, had I not, from its very excess, sunk\r\nsenseless into the arms of my domestics. When I recovered, I found\r\nmyself in my own chamber, and Wilfred seated near me. Some time,\r\nhowever, elapsed before I came to a clear recollection of the past\r\nevents; and when I did, it seemed as if an age of crime and misery had\r\nweighed me down, and chained my tongue. My eye involuntarily wandered to\r\nthat part of the chamber where hung my daughter\u2019s portrait. But this the\r\nfaithful old man\u2014who had not removed it, no doubt thinking that to do so\r\nwould have offended me\u2014had contrived to hide, by placing before it a\r\npiece of armour, which seemed as though it had accidentally fallen into\r\nthat position.\r\n\r\n\u201cMany more days elapsed ere I was enabled to listen to the particulars\r\nof my daughter\u2019s flight, which I will, not to detain you longer with my\r\ngriefs, now briefly relate.\u2014It appeared that, urged by the fame of her\r\nbeauty, and by a curiosity most natural, I confess to youth, Conrad of\r\nW\u00e4dischwyl had, for a long time sought, but sought in vain, to see my\r\nIda. Chance at length, however, favoured him. On her way to hear mass at\r\nour neighbouring monastery, he beheld her; and beheld her but to love.\r\nHer holy errand did not prevent him from addressing her; and well he\r\nknew how to gain the ear of one so innocent, so unsuspicious as my Ida!\r\nToo soon, alas! did his flatteries win their way to her guiltless heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy child\u2019s affection for her father was unbounded; and readily would\r\nshe have sacrificed her life for mine. But when love has once taken\r\npossession of the female heart, too quickly drives he thence those\r\nsterner guests, reason and duty. Suffice it therefore to say she was\r\nwon, and induced to unite herself to W\u00e4dischwyl, before my return, by\r\nhis crafty and insidious argument that I should be more easily persuaded\r\nto give them my pardon and my blessing, when I found that the step that\r\nshe had taken was irrevocable. With almost equal art, he pleaded too\r\nthat their union would doubtless heal the breach between the families of\r\nW\u00e4dischwyl and Unspunnen; and thus terminate that deadly hatred which my\r\ngentle Ida, ever the intercessor for peace, had always condemned. By\r\nthis specious of sophistry my poor child was prevailed upon to tear\r\nherself from the heart of a fond parent, to unite herself with the son\r\nof that parent\u2019s most bitter enemy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe pain of these recollections so overcame Burkhardt, that some time\r\nelapsed ere he could master his feelings. At length he proceeded.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy soul seemed now to have but one feeling, _revenge_. All other\r\npassions were annihilated by this master one; and I instantly prepared\r\nmyself and my vassals to chastise this worse than robber. But such\r\nsatisfaction was (I now thank God) denied me; for the Duke of Z\u00e4hringen\r\nsoon gave me memorable cause to recollect his parting words. Having\r\nattached himself with his numerous followers to my rival\u2019s party, these\r\npowerful chiefs suddenly invaded my domain. A severe struggle against\r\nmost unequal numbers ensued. But, at length, though my brave retainers\r\nwould fain have prolonged the hopeless strife, resolved to stop a\r\nneedless waste of blood, I left the field to my foes; and, with the\r\nremnant of my faithful soldiers, hastened, in deep mortification, to\r\nbury myself within these walls. This galling repulse prevented all\r\npossibility of reconciliation with my daughter, whom I now regarded as\r\nthe cause of my disgrace; and, consequently, I forbade her name even to\r\nbe mentioned in my presence.\r\n\r\n\u201cYears rolled on; and I had no intelligence of her until I learned by a\r\nmere chance that she had with her husband quitted her native land.\r\nAltogether, more than twenty, to me long, long years, have now passed\r\nsince her flight; and though, when time brought repentance, and my anger\r\nand revenge yielded to better feelings, I made every effort to gain\r\ntidings of my poor child, I have not yet been able to discover any\r\nfurther traces of her. Here therefore have I lived a widowed, childless,\r\nheart-broken old man. But I have at least learned to bow to the\r\ndispensations of an all-wise Providence, which has in its justice\r\nstricken me, for thus remorselessly cherishing that baneful passion\r\nwhich Holy Law so expressly forbids. Oh! how I have yearned to see my\r\nbeloved child! how I have longed to clasp her to this withered, blighted\r\nheart! With scalding tears of the bitterest repentance have I revoked\r\nthose deadly curses, which, in the plenitude of my unnatural wrath, I\r\ndared to utter daily. Ceaselessly do I now weary Heaven with my prayers\r\nto obliterate all memory of those fatal imprecations; or to let them\r\nfall on my own head, and shower down only its choicest blessings on that\r\nof my beloved child! But a fear, which freezes my veins with horror,\r\nconstantly haunts me lest the maledictions which I dared to utter in my\r\nmoments of demoniac vindictiveness, should, in punishment for my\r\nimpiety, have been fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\u201cOften, in my dreams, do I behold my beloved child; but her looks are\r\nalways in sadness, and she ever seems mildly but most sorrowfully to\r\nupbraid me for having so inhumanly cast her from me. Yet she must, I\r\nfear, have died long ere now; for, were she living, she would not, I\r\nthink, have ceased to endeavour to regain the affections of a father who\r\nonce loved her so tenderly. It is true that at first she made many\r\nefforts to obtain my forgiveness. Nay, I have subsequently learned that\r\nshe even knelt at the threshold of my door, and piteously supplicated to\r\nbe allowed to see me. But my commands had been so peremptory, and the\r\nsteward who had replaced Wilfred, after his death, was of so stern and\r\nunbending a disposition, that, just and righteous as was this her last\r\nrequest, it was unfeelingly denied to her. Eternal Heaven! she whom I\r\nhad loved as perhaps never father loved before\u2014she whom I had fondly\r\nwatched almost hourly lest the rude breeze of winter should chill her,\r\nor the summer\u2019s heat should scorch her\u2014she whom I had cherished in\r\nsickness through many a livelong night, with a mother\u2019s devotion, and\r\nmore than a mother\u2019s solicitude, even _she_, the only child of my\r\nbeloved Agnes, and the anxious object of the last moments of her life,\r\nwas spurned from my door! from this door whence no want goes unrelieved,\r\nand where the very beggar finds rest! And now, when I would bless the\r\nlips that even could say to me \u2018she lives,\u2019 I can nowhere gather the\r\nslightest tidings of my child. Ah, had I listened to the voice of\r\nreason, had I not suffered my better feelings to be mastered by the\r\nwildest and fellest passions, I might have seen herself, and perhaps her\r\nchildren, happy around me, cheering the evening of my life. And when my\r\nlast hour shall come, they would have closed my eyes in peace, and, in\r\nunfeigned sorrow have daily addressed to Heaven their innocent prayers\r\nfor my soul\u2019s eternal rest.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou now know, pilgrims, the cause of my grief; and I see by the tears\r\nwhich you have so abundantly shed, that you truly pity the forlorn being\r\nbefore you. Remember him and his sorrows therefore ever in your prayers;\r\nand when you kneel at the shrine to which you are bound, let not those\r\nsorrows be forgotten.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe elder pilgrim in vain attempted to answer; the excess of his\r\nfeelings overpowered his utterance. At length, throwing himself at the\r\nfeet of Burkhardt, and casting off his pilgrim\u2019s habits, he with\r\ndifficulty exclaimed,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here, thine Ida\u2019s son! and behold in my youthful companion, thine\r\nIda\u2019s daughter! Yes, before you kneel the children of her whom you so\r\nmuch lament. We came to sue for that pardon, for that love, which we had\r\nfeared would have been denied us. But, thanks be to God, who has\r\nmollified your heart, we have only to implore that you will suffer us to\r\nuse our poor efforts to alleviate your sorrows, and render more bright\r\nand cheerful your declining years.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn wild and agitated surprise, Burkhardt gazed intently upon them. It\r\nseemed to him as if a beautiful vision were before him, which he feared\r\neven a breath might dispel. When, however, he became assured that he was\r\nunder the influence of no delusion, the tumult of his feelings\r\noverpowered him, and he sank senselessly on the neck of the elder\r\npilgrim; who, with his sister\u2019s assistance, quickly raised the old man,\r\nand by their united efforts restored him, ere long, to his senses. But\r\nwhen Burkhardt beheld the younger pilgrim, the very image of his lost\r\nIda, bending over him with the most anxious and tender solicitude, he\r\nthought that death had ended all his worldly sufferings, and that heaven\r\nhad already opened to his view.\r\n\r\n\u201cGreat God!\u201d at length he exclaimed, \u201cI am unworthy of these Thy\r\nmercies! Grant me to receive them as I ought! I need not ask,\u201d added he\r\nafter a pause, and pressing the pilgrims to his bosom, \u201cfor a\r\nconfirmation of your statement, or of my own sensations of joy. All, all\r\ntells me that you are the children of my beloved Ida. Say, therefore, is\r\nyour mother dead? or dare I hope once more to clasp her to my heart?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe elder pilgrim, whose name was Hermann, then stated to him that two\r\nyears had passed since his parent had breathed her last in his arms. Her\r\nlatest prayer was, that Heaven would forgive her the sorrow she had\r\ncaused her father, and forbear to visit her own error on her children\u2019s\r\nheads. He then added that his father had been dead many years.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy mother,\u201d continued Hermann, drawing from his bosom a small sealed\r\npacket, \u201ccommanded me, on her deathbed, to deliver this into your own\r\nhands. \u2018My son,\u2019 she said, \u2018when I am dead, if my father still lives,\r\ncast yourself at his feet, and desist not your supplications until you\r\nhave obtained from him a promise that he will read this prayer. It will\r\nacquaint him with a repentance that may incite him to recall his curse;\r\nand thus cause the earth to lie lightly on all that will shortly remain\r\nof his once loved Ida. Paint to him the hours of anguish which even your\r\ntender years have witnessed. Weary him, my son, with your entreaties;\r\ncease them not until you have wrung from him his forgiveness.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you may suppose, I solemnly engaged to perform my mother\u2019s request;\r\nand as soon as our grief for the loss of so dear, so fond a parent,\r\nwould permit us, my sister and myself resolved, in these pilgrim\u2019s\r\nhabits, to visit your castle; and, by gradual means, attempt to win your\r\naffections, if we found you still relentless, and unwilling to listen to\r\nour mother\u2019s prayer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPraise be to God, my son,\u201d said Burkhardt, \u201cat whose command the waters\r\nspring from the barren rock, that He has bidden the streams of love and\r\nrepentance to flow once more from my once barren and flinty heart. But\r\nlet me not delay to open this sad memorial of your mother\u2019s griefs. I\r\nwish you, my children, to listen to it, that you may hear both her\r\nexculpation and her wrongs.\u201d\r\n\r\nBurkhardt hid his face in his hands, and remained for some moments\r\nearnestly struggling with his feelings. At length he broke the seal,\r\nand, with a voice which at times was almost overpowered, read aloud the\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\u201cMy beloved father,\u2014if by that fond title your daughter may still\r\naddress you,\u2014feeling that my sad days are now numbered, I make this last\r\neffort, ere my strength shall fail me, to obtain at least your pity for\r\nher you once so much loved; and to beseech you to recall that curse\r\nwhich has weighed too heavily upon her heart. Indeed, my father, I am\r\nnot quite that guilty wretch you think me. Do not imagine that,\r\nneglecting every tie of duty and gratitude, I could have left the\r\ntenderest of parents to his widowed lonely home, and have united myself\r\nwith the son of his sworn foe, had I not fondly, most ardently, hoped,\r\nnay, had cherished the idea almost to certainty, that you would, when\r\nyou found that I was a wife, have quickly pardoned a fault, which the\r\nfears of your refusal to our union had alone tempted me to commit. I\r\nfirmly believed that my husband would then have shared with me my\r\nfather\u2019s love, and have, with his child, the pleasing task of watching\r\nover his happiness and comfort. But never did I for an instant imagine\r\nthat I was permanently wounding the heart of that father. My youth, and\r\nthe ardour of my husband\u2019s persuasions, must plead some extenuation of\r\nmy fault.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe day that I learnt the news of your having pronounced against me\r\nthat fatal curse, and your fixed determination never more to admit me to\r\nyour presence, has been marked in characters indelible on my memory. At\r\nthat moment it appeared as if Heaven had abandoned me, had marked me for\r\nits reprobation as a parricide! My brain and my heart seemed on fire,\r\nwhilst my blood froze in my veins. The chillness of death crept over\r\nevery limb, and my tongue refused all utterance. I would have wept, but\r\nthe source of my tears was dried within me.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long I remained in this state I know not, as I became insensible,\r\nand remained so for some days. On returning to a full consciousness of\r\nmy wretchedness, I would instantly have rushed to you, and cast myself\r\nat your feet, to wring from you, if possible, your forgiveness; but my\r\nlimbs were incapable of all motion. Soon, too, I learned that the\r\nletters which I dictated were returned unopened; and my husband at last\r\ninformed me that all his efforts to see you had been utterly fruitless.\r\n\r\n\u201cYet the moment I had gained sufficient strength, I went to the castle,\r\nbut, unfortunately for me, even as I entered, I encountered a stern\r\nwretch, to whom my person was not unknown; and he instantly told me that\r\nmy efforts to see his master would be useless. I used prayers and\r\nentreaties; I even knelt upon the bare ground to him. But so far from\r\nlistening to me, he led me to the gate, and, in my presence, dismissed\r\nthe old porter who had admitted me, and who afterwards followed my\r\nfortunes until the hour of his death. Finding that all my attempts were\r\nfruitless, and that several of the old servants had been discarded on my\r\naccount, with a heart completely broken, I succumbed to my fate, and\r\nabandoned all further attempt.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter the birth of my son (to whose fidelity and love I trust this sad\r\nmemorial), my husband, with the tenderest solicitude, employed every\r\nmeans in his power to divert my melancholy, and having had a valuable\r\nproperty in Italy bequeathed to him, prevailed upon me to repair to that\r\nfavoured and beauteous country. But neither the fond attentions of my\r\nbeloved Conrad, nor the bright sunshine and luxurious breezes, could\r\novercome a grief so deeply rooted as mine; and I soon found that Italy\r\nhad less charms for me than my own dear native land, with its dark\r\npine-clad mountains.\r\n\r\n\u201cShortly after we had arrived at Rome, I gave birth to a daughter;\u2014an\r\nevent which was only too soon followed by the death of my affectionate\r\nhusband. The necessity of ceaseless attention to my infant in some\r\nmeasure alleviated the intense anguish which I suffered from that most\r\nsevere loss. Nevertheless, in the very depth of this sorrow, which\r\nalmost overcharged my heart, Heaven only knows how often, and how\r\nremorsefully, while bending over my own dear children in sickness, have\r\nI called to mind the anxious fondness with which the tenderest and best\r\nof fathers used to watch over me!\r\n\r\n\u201cI struggled long and painfully with my feelings, and often did I\r\nbeseech God to spare my life, that I might be enabled to instruct my\r\nchildren in His holy love and fear, and teach them to atone for the\r\nerror of their parent. My prayer has in mercy been heard; the boon I\r\nsupplicated has been granted; and I trust, my beloved father, that if\r\nthese children should be admitted to your affections, you will find that\r\nI have trained up two blessed intercessors for your forgiveness, when it\r\nshall have pleased Heaven to have called your daughter to her account\r\nbefore that dread tribunal where a sire\u2019s curse will plead so awfully\r\nagainst her. Recall then, oh, father! recall your dreadful malediction\r\nfrom your poor repentant Ida! and send your blessing as an angel of\r\nmercy to plead for her eternal rest. Farewell, my father, for ever! for\r\never, farewell! By the cross, whose emblem her fevered lips now press;\r\nby Him, who in His boundless mercy hung upon that cross, your daughter,\r\nyour once much loved Ida, implores you, supplicates you, not to let her\r\nplead in vain!\u201d\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\u201cMy child, my child!\u201d sobbed Burkhardt, as the letter dropped from his\r\nhand, \u201cmay the Father of All forgive me as freely as I from the depths\r\nof my wrung heart forgive you! Would that your remorseful father could\r\nhave pressed you to his heart, with his own lips have assured you of his\r\naffection, and wiped away the tears of sorrow from your eyes! But he\r\nwill cherish these beloved remembrances of you, and will more jealously\r\nguard them than his own life.\u201d\r\n\r\nBurkhardt passed the whole of the following day in his chamber, to which\r\nthe good Father Jerome alone was admitted, as the events of the\r\npreceding day rendered a long repose absolutely necessary. The following\r\nmorning, however, he entered the hall, where Hermann and Ida were\r\nimpatiently waiting for him. His pale countenance still exhibited deep\r\ntraces of the agitation he had experienced; but having kissed his\r\nchildren most affectionately, he smilingly flung round Ida\u2019s neck a\r\nmassive gold chain, richly wrought, with a bunch of keys appended to it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must duly install our Lady of the Castle,\u201d said he, \u201cand invest her\r\nwith her appropriate authorities.\u2014But, hark! from the sound of the\r\nporter\u2019s horn it seems as if our hostess would have early calls upon her\r\nhospitality. Whom have we here?\u201d continued he, looking out up the\r\navenue. \u201cBy St. Hubert, a gay and gallant knight is approaching, who\r\nshall be right welcome\u2014that is, if my lady approve. Well, Willibald,\r\nwhat bring you?\u2014a letter from our good friend the Abbot of St. Anselm.\r\nWhat says he?\u201d\r\n\r\n    \u201cI am sure that you will not refuse your welcome to a young knight,\r\n    who is returning by your castle to his home, from the Emperor\u2019s\r\n    wars. He is well known to me, and I can vouch for his being a guest\r\n    worthy of your hospitality, which will not be the less freely\r\n    granted to him because he does not bask in the _golden_ smiles of\r\n    fortune.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, that it shall not, my good friend; and if fortune frown upon\r\nhim, he shall be doubly welcome. Conduct him hither instantly, good\r\nWillibald.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe steward hastened to usher in the stranger, who advanced into the\r\nhall with a modest but manly air. He was apparently about twenty-five\r\nyears of age; his person was such as might well, in the dreams of a\r\nyoung maiden, occupy no unconspicuous place.\r\n\r\n\u201cSir Knight,\u201d said Burkhardt, taking him cordially by the hand, \u201cyou are\r\nright welcome to my castle, and such poor entertainment as it can\r\nafford. We must make you forget your wounds, and the rough usage of a\r\nsoldier\u2019s life. But, soft, I already neglect my duty in not first\r\nintroducing our hostess,\u201d added the aged knight, presenting Ida. \u201cBy my\r\nfaith,\u201d he continued, \u201cjudging from my lady\u2019s blushing smile, you seem\r\nnot to have met for the first time. Am I right in my conjecture?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe _have_ met, sir,\u201d replied Ida, with such confusion as pleasantly\r\nimplied that the meeting was not indifferently recollected, \u201cin the\r\nparlour of the abbess of the Ursulines, at Munich, where I have\r\nsometimes been to visit a much valued friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe abbess,\u201d said the young knight, \u201cwas my cousin; and my good fortune\r\nmore than once gave me the happiness of seeing in her convent this lady.\r\nBut little did I expect that amongst these mountains the fickle goddess\r\nwould again have so favoured a homeless wanderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Sir Knight,\u201d replied Burkhardt, \u201cwe trust that fortune has been\r\nequally favourable to us. And now we will make bold to ask your name;\r\nand then, without useless and tedious ceremony, on the part of ourselves\r\nand our hostess, bid you again a hearty welcome.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name,\u201d said the stranger, \u201cis Walter de Blumfeldt; though humble, it\r\nhas never been disgraced; and with the blessing of Heaven, I hope to\r\nhand it down as honoured as I have received it.\u201d\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWeeks, months rolled on, and Walter de Blumfeldt was still the guest of\r\nthe Lord of Unspunnen; till, by his virtues, and the many excellent\r\nqualities which daily more and more developed themselves, he wound\r\nhimself around Burkhardt\u2019s heart, which the chastened life of the old\r\nknight had rendered particularly susceptible of the kindlier feelings.\r\nFrequently would he now, with tears in his eyes, declare that he wished\r\nhe could convince each and all with whom his former habits had caused\r\nany difference, how truly he forgave them, and desired their\r\nforgiveness.\r\n\r\n\u201cWould,\u201d said he one day, in allusion to this subject, \u201cthat I could\r\nhave met my old enemy, the Duke of Z\u00e4hringen, and with a truly heartfelt\r\npleasure and joy have embraced him, and numbered him amongst my friends.\r\nBut he is gathered to his fathers, and I know not whether he has left\r\nany one to bear his honours.\u201d\r\n\r\nEach time that Walter had offered to depart, Burkhardt had found some\r\nexcuse to detain him; for it seemed to him that in separating from his\r\nyoung guest he should lose a link of that chain which good fortune had\r\nso lately woven for him. Hermann, too, loved Walter as a brother; and\r\nIda fain would have imagined that she loved him as a sister; but her\r\nheart more plainly told her what her colder reasoning sought to hide.\r\nUnspunnen, who had for some time perceived the growing attachment\r\nbetween Walter and Ida, was not displeased at the discovery, as he had\r\nlong ceased to covet riches; and had learnt to prize the sterling worth\r\nof the young knight, who fully answered the high terms in which the\r\nPrior of St. Anselm always spoke of him. Walking one evening under the\r\nshade of that very avenue where he had first encountered Hermann and\r\nIda, he perceived the latter, at some little distance, in conversation\r\nwith Walter. It was evident to Burkhardt that the young knight was not\r\naddressing himself to a very unwilling ear, as Ida was totally\r\nregardless of the loud cough with which Burkhardt chose to be seized at\r\nthat moment; nor did she perceive him, until he exclaimed, or rather\r\nvociferated,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know, Walter, that, under this very avenue, two pilgrims, bound\r\nto some holy shrine, once accosted me; but that, in pity to my sins and\r\nforlorn condition, they exchanged their penitential journey for an act\r\nof greater charity, and have ever since remained to extend their kind\r\ncares to an aged and helpless relative. One, however, of these\r\naffectionate beings is now about to quit my abode, and to pass through\r\nthe rest of this life\u2019s pilgrimage with a helpmate, in the person of the\r\nfair daughter of the Baron de Leichtfeldt, and thus leave his poor\r\ncompanion with only the tedious society of an old man. Say, Sir Knight,\r\nwill thy valour suffer that such wrong be done; or wilt _thou_ undertake\r\nto conduct this forsaken pilgrim on her way, and guide her through the\r\nchequered paths of this variable life? I see by the lowliness with which\r\nyou bend, and the colour which mantles in your cheek, that I speak not\r\nto one insensible to an old man\u2019s appeal. But soft, soft, Sir Knight, my\r\nIda is not yet canonized, and therefore cannot afford to lose a hand,\r\nwhich inevitably must occur if you continue to press it with such very\r\nardent devotion. But what says our pilgrim; does she accept of thy\r\nconduct and service, Sir Knight?\u201d\r\n\r\nIda, scarcely able to support herself, threw herself on Burkhardt\u2019s\r\nneck. We will not raise the veil which covers the awful moment that\r\nrenders a man, as he supposes, happy or miserable for ever. Suffice it\r\nto say that the day which made Hermann the husband of the daughter of\r\nthe Baron de Leichtfeldt, saw Ida the wife of Walter de Blumfeldt.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSix months had passed rapidly away to the happy inhabitants of\r\nUnspunnen, and Burkhardt seemed almost to have grown young again. He was\r\none of the most active in the preparations which were necessary in\r\nconsequence of Walter suggesting that they should spend Ida\u2019s birthday\r\nin a favourite retreat of his and hers. This chosen spot was a beautiful\r\nmeadow, in front of which meandered a small limpid stream; at the back\r\nwas a gorgeous amphitheatre of trees, the wide-spreading branches of\r\nwhich cast a refreshing shade over the richly enamelled grass.\r\n\r\nIn this beauteous retreat were Burkhardt, Walter, and his Ida passing\r\nthe sultry hours of noon, when Walter, who had been relating some of his\r\nadventures at the court of the Emperor, and recounting the magnificence\r\nof the tournaments, turning to his bride, said,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what avails all that pomp, my Ida. How happy are we in this\r\npeaceful vale! we envy neither princes nor dukes their palaces or their\r\nstates. What say you, my Ida, could you brook the ceremony of a court,\r\nand the pride of royalty? Methinks even the coronet of a duchess would\r\nbut ill replace the wreath of blushing roses on your head.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGently, my good husband,\u201d replied Ida, laughing; \u201cthey say, you know,\r\nthat a woman loves these vanities too dearly in her heart ever to\r\ndespise them. Then how can you expect so frail a mortal as your poor\r\nwife to hold them in contempt? Indeed, I think,\u201d added she, assuming an\r\nair of burlesque dignity, \u201cthat I should make a lofty duchess, and wear\r\nmy coronet with most becoming grace. And now, by my faith, Walter, I\r\nrecollect that you have this day, like a true and gallant knight,\r\npromised to grant whatever boon I shall ask. On my bended knee,\r\ntherefore, I humbly sue that if you know any spell or magic wile, to\r\nmake a princess or a duchess for only a single day, that you will\r\nforthwith exercise your art upon me; just in order to enable me to\r\nascertain with how much or how little dignity I could sustain such\r\nhonours. It is no very difficult matter, Sir Knight: you have only to\r\ncall in the aid of Number Nip, or some such handy workman of the woods.\r\nAnswer, most chivalrous husband, for thy disconsolate wife rises not\r\nuntil her prayer is granted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Ida, you have indeed craved a rare boon,\u201d replied Walter; \u201cand how\r\nto grant it may well puzzle my brain till it becomes crazed with the\r\neffort. But, let me see, let me see,\u201d continued he musingly; \u201cI have\r\nit!\u2014Come hither, love, here is your throne,\u201d said he, placing her on a\r\ngentle eminence richly covered with the fragrant wild thyme and the\r\ndelicate harebell; \u201ckings might now envy you the incense which is\r\noffered to you. And you, noble sir,\u201d added he, addressing Burkhardt,\r\n\u201cmust stand beside her Highness, in quality of chief counsellor. There\r\nare your attendants around you; behold that tall oak, he must be your\r\nHighness\u2019s pursuivant; and yonder slender mountain ashes, your trusty\r\npages.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is but a poor fulfilment of the task you have undertaken, Sir\r\nmummer,\u201d said Ida, with a playful and arch affectation of\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave patience for a brief while, fair dame,\u201d replied Walter, laughing;\r\n\u201cfor now I must awaken your Highness\u2019s men-at-arms.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen, taking from his side a silver horn, he loudly sounded the\r\nmelodious reveille. As he withdrew the instrument from his lips, a\r\ntrumpet thrillingly answered to the call; and scarcely had its last\r\nnotes died away, when, from the midst of the woods, as if the very trees\r\nwere gifted with life, came forth a troop of horsemen, followed by a\r\nbody of archers on foot. They had but just entirely emerged, when\r\nnumerous peasants, both male and female, appeared in their gayest\r\nattire; and, together with the horsemen and the archers, rapidly and\r\npicturesquely ranged themselves in front of the astonished Ida, who had\r\nalready abdicated her throne, and clung to the arm of Walter. They then\r\nsuddenly divided, and twelve pages in richly-emblazoned dresses\r\nadvanced. After them followed six young girls, whose forms and features\r\nthe Graces might have envied, bearing two coronets placed on embroidered\r\ncushions. In the rear of these, supporting his steps with his abbatial\r\nstaff, walked the venerable Abbot of St. Anselm, who, with his white\r\nbeard flowing almost to his girdle, and his benign looks that showed the\r\npure commerce of the soul which gave life to an eye the brightness of\r\nwhich seventy years had scarcely diminished, seemed to Ida a being of\r\nanother world. The young girls then advancing, and kneeling before\r\nWalter and his wife, presented the coronets.\r\n\r\nIda, who had remained almost breathless with wonder, could now scarcely\r\narticulate,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDear, dear Walter, what is all this pomp\u2014what does\u2014what _can_ it mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMean! my beloved,\u201d replied her husband; \u201cdid you not bid me make you a\r\nduchess? I have but obeyed your high commands, and I now salute you,\r\n_Duchess_ of Z\u00e4hringen!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe whole multitude then made the woods resound with the acclamation,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201c_Long live the Duke and Duchess of Z\u00e4hringen!_\u201d\r\n\r\nWalter, having for some moments enjoyed the unutterable amazement of the\r\nnow breathless Ida, and the less evident but perhaps equally intense\r\nsurprise of Burkhardt, turning to the latter, said,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMy more than father, you see in me the son of your once implacable\r\nenemy, the Duke of Z\u00e4hringen. He has been many years gathered to his\r\nfathers; and I, as his only son, have succeeded to his title and his\r\npossessions. My heart, my liberty, were entirely lost in the parlour of\r\nthe Abbess of the Ursulines. But when I learnt whose child my Ida was,\r\nand your sad story, I resolved ere I would make her mine to win not only\r\nher love, but also your favour and esteem. How well I have succeeded,\r\nthis little magic circle on my Ida\u2019s finger is my witness. It will add\r\nno small measure to your happiness to know that my father had for many\r\nyears repented of the wrongs which he had done you; and, as much as\r\npossible to atone for them, entrusted the education of his son to the\r\ncare of this my best of friends, the Abbot of St. Anselm, that he might\r\nlearn to shun the errors into which his sire had unhappily fallen. And\r\nnow,\u201d continued he, advancing, and leading Ida towards the abbot, \u201cI\r\nhave only to beg your blessing, and that this lady, whom through\r\nHeaven\u2019s goodness I glory to call my wife, be invested with those\r\ninsignia of the rank which she is so fit to adorn.\u201d\r\n\r\nWalter, or, as we must now call him, the Duke of Z\u00e4hringen, with Ida,\r\nthen lowly knelt before the venerable abbot, whilst the holy man, with\r\ntears in his eyes, invoked upon them the blessings of Heaven. His\r\nHighness then rising, took one of the coronets, and placing it on Ida\u2019s\r\nhead, said,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMayst thou be as happy under this glittering coronet, as thou wert\r\nunder the russet hood in which I first beheld thee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGod and our Lady aid me!\u201d replied the agitated Ida; \u201cand may He grant\r\nthat I may wear it with as much humility. Yet thorns, they say, spring\r\nup beneath a crown.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue, my beloved,\u201d said the duke, \u201cand they also grow beneath the\r\npeasant\u2019s homely cap. But the rich alchemy of my Ida\u2019s virtues will ever\r\nconvert all thorns into the brightest jewels of her diadem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 FINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                MORRISON AND GIBB, PRINTERS, EDINBURGH.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PATERSON\u2019S\r\n                          NEW ENGLAND NOVELS.\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n      Cloth, gilt top, 2s. each; ornamental paper cover, 1s. each.\r\n\r\n                     Contain the following Works:\u2014\r\n\r\n                          NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE.\r\n\r\n         1.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\r\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\r\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\r\nlocations.

Newby\r\n    Chief Executive and Director\r\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n"
