He did not earn very much, and\r\nhad to be out in all weathers and all day long. But Toby was of a\r\ncheerful disposition, and looked on the bright side of everything. His\r\ngreatest joy was his dear daughter Meg, who loved him dearly.\r\n\r\nOne cold day Toby had been trotting up and down in his usual place\r\nbefore the church, when the bells chimed twelve o'clock, which made Toby\r\nthink of dinner.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing,\" he remarked, \"more regular in coming round than\r\ndinner-time, and nothing less regular in coming round than dinner.\r\nThat's the great difference between 'em.\" He went on talking to himself\r\nnever noticing who was coming near to him.\r\n\r\n\"Why, father, father,\" said a pleasant voice, and Toby turned to find\r\nhis daughter's sweet, bright eyes close to his.\r\n\r\n\"Why, pet,\" said he, kissing her, \"what's-to-do? I didn't expect you\r\nto-day, Meg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither did I expect to come, father,\" said Meg, smiling. \"But here I\r\nam! And not alone, not alone!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you don't mean to say,\" observed Trotty, looking curiously at the\r\ncovered basket she carried, \"that you?----\"\r\n\r\n\"Smell it, father dear,\" said Meg; \"only smell it, and guess what it\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\nToby took the shortest possible sniff at the edge of the basket. \"Why,\r\nit's hot,\" he said.\r\n\r\nBut to Meg's great delight he could not guess what it was that smelt so\r\ngood. At last he exclaimed in triumph, \"Why, what am I a-thinking of?\r\nIt's tripe!\"\r\n\r\nAnd it was.\r\n\r\nJust as Toby was about to sit down to his dinner on the doorsteps of a\r\nbig house close by, the chimes rang out again, and Toby took off his hat\r\nand said, \"Amen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen to the bells, father?\"\r\n\r\n\"They broke in like a grace, my dear,\" said Trotty, \"they'd say a good\r\none if they could, I'm sure. Many's the kind thing they say to me. How\r\noften have I heard them bells say, 'Toby Veck, Toby Veck, keep a good\r\nheart, Toby!' A millions times? More!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I never!\" cried Meg.\r\n\r\nWhile Toby ate his unexpected dinner with immense relish, Meg told him\r\nhow her lover Richard, a young blacksmith, had brought his dinner to\r\nshare with her, and had begged her to marry him on New Year's Day, \"the\r\nbest and happiest day of the whole year.\"\r\n\r\n\"So,\" went on Meg, \"I wanted to make this a sort of holiday to you, as\r\nwell as a dear and happy day to me, father, and I made a little treat\r\nand brought it to surprise you.\"\r\n\r\nJust then, Richard himself came up to persuade Toby to agree to their\r\nplan; and almost at the same moment, a footman came out of the house and\r\nordered them all off the steps, and some gentleman came out who called\r\nup Trotty, and gave him a letter to carry.\r\n\r\nToby trotted off to a very grand house, where he was told to take the\r\nletter in to the gentleman. While he was waiting, he heard the letter\r\nread. It was from Alderman Cute, to tell Sir Joseph Bowley that one of\r\nhis tenants named Will Fern who had come to London to try and get work,\r\nhad been brought before him charged with sleeping in a shed, and asking\r\nif Sir Joseph wished him to be dealt leniently with or otherwise. To\r\nToby's great disappointment the answer was given that Will Fern might be\r\nsent to prison as a vagabond, though his only fault was poverty. On his\r\nway home, Toby ran against a man dressed like a countryman, carrying a\r\nfair-haired little girl. The man asked him the way to Alderman Cute's\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\"It's impossible,\" cried Toby, \"that your name is Will Fern?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my name,\" said the man.\r\n\r\nThereupon Toby told him what he had just heard, and said \"Don't go\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TROTTY VECK'S DINNER.\r\n  TOBY TOOK A SNIFF AT THE EDGE OF THE BASKET.]\r\n\r\nPoor Will told him how he could not make a living in the country, and\r\nhad come to London with his orphan niece to try and find a friend of her\r\nmother's and to endeavor to get some work, and wishing Toby a happy\r\nNew Year, was about to trudge wearily off again, when Trotty caught his\r\nhand saying--\r\n\r\n\"Stay! The New Year never can be happy to me if I see the child and you\r\ngo wandering away without a shelter for your heads. Come home with me.\r\nI'm a poor man, living in a poor place, but I can give you lodging for\r\none night and never miss it,\" and lifting up the pretty little one, he\r\ntrotted towards home, and rushing in, he set the child down before his\r\ndaughter. The little girl ran into her arms at once, while Trotty ran\r\nround the room, saying, \"Here we are and here we go. Here, Uncle Will,\r\ncome to the fire. Meg, my precious darling, where's the kettle? Here it\r\nis and here it goes, and it'll bile in no time!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, father!\" said Meg, \"you're crazy to-night, I think. Poor little\r\nfeet, how cold they are!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they're warmer now!\" exclaimed the child. \"They're quite warm now!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no,\" said Meg. \"We haven't rubbed 'em half enough. And when\r\nthey're done, we'll brush out the damp hair; and we'll bring some color\r\nto the poor pale face with fresh water; and then we'll be so gay and\r\nbrisk and happy!\"\r\n\r\nThe child sobbing, clasped her round the neck, saying, \"O Meg, O dear\r\nMeg!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious me!\" said Meg, presently, \"father's crazy! He's put the\r\ndear child's bonnet on the kettle, and hung the lid behind the door!\"\r\n\r\nTrotty hastily repaired this mistake, and went off to find some tea and\r\na rasher of bacon he fancied \"he had seen lying somewhere on the\r\nstairs.\" He soon came back and made the tea, and before long they were\r\nall enjoying the meal.\r\n\r\nAfter tea Meg took Lilian to bed, and Toby showed Will Fern where he was\r\nto sleep. Then he went to sit by the fire and read his paper, and fell\r\nasleep, to have a wonderful dream so terrible and sad, that it was a\r\ngreat relief when he woke to find Meg sitting near him, putting some\r\nribbons on her simple gown for her wedding, and looking so happy and\r\nyoung and blooming, that he jumped up to clasp her in his arms.\r\n\r\nBut somebody came rushing in between them, crying,--\"No! Not even you.\r\nThe first kiss of Meg in the New Year is mine. Meg, my precious prize,\r\na happy year! A life of happy years, my darling wife!\"\r\n\r\nThen in came Lilian and Will Fern, and a band of music with a flock of\r\nneighbors burst into the room, shouting, \"A Happy New Year, Meg.\" \"A\r\nhappy wedding!\" \"Many of 'em,\" and the Drum stepped forward and said--\r\n\r\n\"Trotty Veck, it's got about that your daughter is to be married\r\nto-morrow. And there ain't a soul that knows you both that don't wish\r\nyou both all the happiness the New Year can bring. And here we are, to\r\nplay it in and dance it in accordingly.\" Then Mrs. Chickenstalker came\r\nin (a good-humored, comely woman, who, to the delight of all, turned out\r\nto be the friend of Lilian's mother for whom Will Fern had come to\r\nlook), to wish Meg joy, and then the music struck up, and Trotty, making\r\nMeg and Richard second couple, led off Mrs. Chickenstalker down the\r\ndance, and danced it in a step unknown before or since, founded on his\r\nown peculiar trot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTINY TIM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a man who did not like Christmas. His name was Scrooge,\r\nand he was a hard sour-tempered man of business, intent only on saving\r\nand making money, and caring nothing for anyone. He paid the poor,\r\nhard-working clerk in his office as little as he could possibly get the\r\nwork done for, and lived on as little as possible himself, alone, in two\r\ndismal rooms. He was never merry or comfortable, or happy, and he hated\r\nother people to be so, and that was the reason why he hated Christmas,\r\nbecause people will be happy at Christmas, you know, if they possibly\r\ncan.\r\n\r\nWell, it was Christmas eve, a very cold and foggy one, and Mr. Scrooge,\r\nhaving given his poor clerk unwilling permission to spend Christmas day\r\nat home, locked up his office and went home himself in a very bad\r\ntemper. After having taken some gruel as he sat over a miserable fire in\r\nhis dismal room, he got into bed, and had some wonderful and\r\ndisagreeable dreams, to which we will leave him, whilst we see how Tiny\r\nTim, the son of his poor clerk, spent Christmas day.\r\n\r\nThe name of this clerk was Bob Cratchet. He had a wife and five other\r\nchildren beside Tim, who was a weak and delicate little cripple, gentle\r\nand patient and loving, with a sweet face of his own, which no one could\r\nhelp looking at.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Cratchet's delight to carry his little boy out on his\r\nshoulder to see the shops and the people; and to-day he had taken him to\r\nchurch for the first time.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever has got your precious father, and your brother Tiny Tim!\"\r\nexclaimed Mrs. Cratchet, \"here's dinner all ready to be dished up. I've\r\nnever known him so late on Christmas day before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here he is, mother!\" cried Belinda, and \"here he is!\" cried the other\r\nchildren, as Mr. Cratchet came in, his long comforter hanging three feet\r\nfrom under his threadbare coat; for cold as it was the poor clerk had no\r\ntop-coat. Tiny Tim was perched on his father's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"And how did Tim behave?\" asked Mrs. Cratchet.\r\n\r\n\"As good as gold and better,\" replied his father. \"He told me, coming\r\nhome, that he hoped the people in church, who saw he was a cripple,\r\nwould be pleased to remember on Christmas day who it was who made the\r\nlame to walk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless his sweet heart!\" said the mother in a trembling voice.\r\n\r\nDinner was waiting to be dished up. Mrs. Cratchet proudly placed a goose\r\nupon the table. Belinda brought in the apple sauce, and Peter the mashed\r\npotatoes; the other children set chairs, Tim's as usual close to his\r\nfather's; and Tim was so excited that he rapped the table with his\r\nknife, and carried \"Hurrah.\" After the goose came the pudding, all\r\nablaze, with its sprig of holly in the middle, and was eaten to the last\r\nmorsel; then apples and oranges were set upon the table, and a shovelful\r\nof chestnuts on the fire, and Mr. Cratchet served round some hot sweet\r\nstuff out of a jug as they closed round the fire, and said, \"A Merry\r\nChristmas to us all, my dears, God bless us.\" \"God bless us, every one,\"\r\nechoed Tiny Tim, and then they drank each other's health, and Mr.\r\nScrooge's health, and told stories and sang songs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TINY TIM.\r\n  TINY TIM WAS PERCHED ON HIS FATHER'S SHOULDER.]\r\n\r\nNow in one of Mr. Scrooge's dreams on Christmas eve a Christmas spirit\r\nshowed him his clerk's home; he saw them all, heard them drink his\r\nhealth, and he took special note of Tiny Tim himself.\r\n\r\nHow Mr. Scrooge spent Christmas day we do not know; but on Christmas\r\nnight he had more dreams, and the spirit took him again to his clerk's\r\npoor home.\r\n\r\nUpstairs, the father, with his face hidden in his hands, sat beside a\r\nlittle bed, on which lay a tiny figure, white and still. \"Tiny Tim died\r\nbecause his father was too poor to give him what was necessary to make\r\nhim well; _you_ kept him poor,\" said the dream-spirit to Mr. Scrooge.\r\nThe father kissed the cold, little face on the bed, and went\r\ndown-stairs, where the sprays of holly still remained about the humble\r\nroom; and taking his hat, went out, with a wistful glance at the little\r\ncrutch in the corner as he shut the door. Mr. Scrooge saw all this, but,\r\nwonderful to relate, he woke the next morning feeling as he had never\r\nfelt in his life before.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I am as light as a feather, and as happy as an angel, and as merry\r\nas a schoolboy,\" he said to himself. \"I hope everybody had a merry\r\nChristmas, and here's a happy New Year to all the world.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Bob Cratchet crept into the office a few minutes late, expecting to\r\nbe scolded for it, but his master was there with his back to a good\r\nfire, and actually smiling, and he shook hands with his clerk, telling\r\nhim heartily he was going to raise his salary, and asking quite\r\naffectionately after Tiny Tim! \"And mind you make up a good fire in your\r\nroom before you set to work, Bob,\" he said, as he closed his own door.\r\n\r\nBob could hardly believe his eyes and ears, but it was all true. Such\r\ndoings as they had on New Year's day had never been seen before in the\r\nCratchet's home, nor such a turkey as Mr. Scrooge sent them for dinner.\r\nTiny Tim had his share too, for Tiny Tim did not die, not a bit of it.\r\nMr. Scrooge was a second father to him from that day, he wanted for\r\nnothing, and grew up strong and hearty. Mr. Scrooge loved him, and well\r\nhe might, for was it not Tiny Tim who had unconsciously, through the\r\nChristmas dream-spirit, touched his hard heart, and caused him to become\r\na good and happy man?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE DOMBEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle Dombey was the son of a rich city merchant, a cold, stern, and\r\npompous man, whose life and interests were entirely absorbed in his\r\nbusiness. He was so desirous of having a son to associate with himself\r\nin the business, and make the house once more Dombey & Son in fact, as\r\nit was in name, that the little boy who was at last born to him was\r\neagerly welcomed.\r\n\r\nThere was a pretty little girl six years old, but her father had taken\r\nlittle notice of her. Of what use was a girl to Dombey & Son? She could\r\nnot go into the business.\r\n\r\nLittle Dombey's mother died when he was born, but the event did not\r\ngreatly disturb Mr. Dombey; and since his son lived, what did it matter\r\nto him that his little daughter Florence was breaking her heart in\r\nloneliness for the mother who had loved and cherished her!\r\n\r\nDuring the first few months of his life, little Dombey grew and\r\nflourished; and as soon as he was old enough to take notice, there was\r\nno one he loved so well as his sister Florence.\r\n\r\nIn due time the baby was taken to church, and baptized by the name of\r\nPaul (his father's name). A grand and stately christening it was,\r\nfollowed by a grand and stately feast; and little Paul was declared by\r\nhis godmother to be \"an angel, and the perfect picture of his own papa.\"\r\n\r\nBut from that time Paul seemed to waste and pine; his healthy and\r\nthriving babyhood had received a check, and as for illnesses, \"There\r\nnever was a blessed dear so put upon,\" his nurse said.\r\n\r\nBy the time he was five years old, though he had the prettiest, sweetest\r\nlittle face in the world, there was always a patient, wistful look upon\r\nit, and he was thin and tiny and delicate. He soon got tired, and had\r\nsuch old-fashioned ways of speaking and doing things, that his nurse\r\noften shook her head sadly over him.\r\n\r\nWhen he sat in his little arm-chair with his father, after dinner, they\r\nwere a strange pair,--so like, and so unlike each other.\r\n\r\n\"What is money, papa?\" asked Paul on one of these occasions, crossing\r\nhis tiny arms as well as he could--just as his father's were crossed.\r\n\r\n\"Why, gold, silver and copper; you know what it is well enough, Paul,\"\r\nanswered his father.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes; I mean, what can money do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything, everything--almost,\" replied Mr. Dombey, taking one of his\r\nson's wee hands.\r\n\r\nPaul drew his hand gently away. \"It didn't save me my mamma, and it\r\ncan't make me strong and big,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you _are_ strong and big, as big as such little people usually\r\nare,\" returned Mr. Dombey.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Paul, sighing; \"when Florence was as little as me, she was\r\nstrong and tall, and did not get tired of playing as I do. I am so tired\r\nsometimes, papa.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dombey's anxiety was aroused, and the doctor was sent for to examine\r\nPaul.\r\n\r\n\"The child is hardly so stout as we could wish,\" said the doctor; \"his\r\nmind is too big for his body, he thinks too much--let him try sea\r\nair--sea air does wonders for children.\"\r\n\r\nSo it was arranged that Florence, Paul, and nurse should go to Brighton,\r\nand stay in the house of a lady named Mrs. Pipchin, who kept a very\r\nselect boarding-house for children.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that, apart from his importance to the house of Dombey\r\n& Son, little Paul had crept into his father's heart, cold though it\r\nstill was towards his daughter, colder than ever now, for there was in\r\nit a sort of unacknowledged jealousy of the warm love lavished on her by\r\nPaul, which he himself was unable to win.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pipchin was a marvellously ugly old lady, with a hook nose and\r\nstern cold eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Master Paul, how do you think you will like me?\" said Mrs.\r\nPipchin, seeing the child intently regarding her.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I shall like you at all,\" replied Paul, shaking his head.\r\n\"I want to go away. I do not like your house.\"\r\n\r\nPaul did not like Mrs. Pipchin, but he would sit in his arm-chair and\r\nlook at her. Her ugliness seemed to fascinate him.\r\n\r\nAs the weeks went by little Paul grew more healthy-looking, but he did\r\nnot seem any stronger, and could not run about out of doors. A little\r\ncarriage was therefore got for him, in which he could be wheeled down to\r\nthe beach, where he would pass the greater part of the day. He took a\r\ngreat fancy to a queer crab-faced old man, smelling of sea-weed, who\r\nwheeled his carriage, and held long conversations with him; but Florence\r\nwas the only child companion whom he ever cared to have with him, though\r\nhe liked to watch other children playing in the distance.\r\n\r\n\"I love you, Floy,\" he said one day to her.\r\n\r\nFlorence laid her head against his pillow, and whispered how much\r\nstronger he was growing.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I know, I am a great deal better,\" said Paul, \"a very great\r\ndeal better. Listen, Floy; what is it the sea keeps saying?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, dear, it is only the rolling of the waves you hear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but they are always saying something, and always the same thing.\r\nWhat place is over there, Floy?\"\r\n\r\nShe told him there was another country opposite, but Paul said he did\r\nnot mean that, he meant somewhere much farther away, oh, much farther\r\naway--and often he would break off in the midst of their talk to listen\r\nto the sea and gaze out towards that country \"farther away.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having lived at Brighton for a year, Paul was certainly much\r\nstronger, though still thin and delicate. And on one of his weekly\r\nvisits, Mr. Dombey explained to Mrs. Pipchin, with pompous\r\ncondescension, that Paul's weak health having kept him back in his\r\nstudies, he had made arrangements to place him at the educational\r\nestablishment of Dr. Blimber, which was close by. Florence was, for the\r\npresent, to remain under Mrs. Pipchin's care, and see her brother every\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nDr. Blimber's school was a great hot-house for the forcing of boy's\r\nbrains; and Dr. Blimber promised speedily to make a man of Paul.\r\n\r\n\"Shall you like to be made a man of, my son?\" asked Mr. Dombey.\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather be a child and stay with Floy,\" answered Paul.\r\n\r\nMiss Blimber, the doctor's daughter, a learned lady in spectacles, was\r\nhis special tutor, and from morning till night his poor little brains\r\nwere forced and crammed till his head was heavy and always had a dull\r\nache in it, and his small legs grew weak again--every day he looked a\r\nlittle thinner and a little paler, and became more old-fashioned than\r\never in his looks and ways--\"old-fashioned\" was a distinguishing title\r\nwhich clung to him. He was gentle and polite to every one--always\r\nlooking out for small kindnesses which he might do to any inmate of the\r\nhouse. \"The oddest and most old-fashioned child in the world,\" Dr.\r\nBlimber would say to his daughter; \"but bring him on, Cornelia--bring\r\nhim on.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Cornelia did bring him on; and Florence, seeing how pale and weary\r\nthe little fellow looked when he came to her on Saturdays, and how he\r\ncould not rest from anxiety about his lessons, would lighten his labors\r\na little, and ease his mind by helping him to prepare his week's work.\r\nBut one day, when his lessons were over, little Paul laid his weary and\r\naching head against the knee of a schoolfellow of whom he was very fond;\r\nand the first thing he noticed when he opened his eyes was that the\r\nwindow was open, his face and hair were wet with water, and that Dr.\r\nBlimber and the usher were both standing looking at him.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's well,\" said Dr. Blimber, as Paul opened his eyes, \"and how\r\nis my little friend now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, quite well, thank you, sir,\" answered Paul, but when he got up\r\nthere seemed something the matter with the floor, and the walls were\r\ndancing about, and Dr. Blimber's head was twice its natural size. He was\r\nput to bed, and presently the doctor came and said he was not to do any\r\nmore lessons for the present.\r\n\r\nIn a few days Paul was able to get up and creep about the house. He\r\nwondered sometimes why every one looked at and spoke so very kindly to\r\nhim, and was more than ever careful to do any little kindnesses he could\r\nthink of for them: even the rough, ugly dog Diogenes, who lived in the\r\nyard, came in for a share of his attentions.\r\n\r\nThere was a party at Dr. Blimber's on the evening before the boys went\r\nhome. Paul sat in a corner of the sofa all the evening, and every one\r\nwas very kind to him indeed, it was quite extraordinary, Paul thought,\r\nand he was very happy; he liked to see how pretty Florence was, and how\r\nevery one admired and wished to dance with her. After resting for a\r\nnight at Mrs. Pipchin's house, little Paul went home, and was carried\r\nstraight upstairs to his bed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LITTLE PAUL AND FLORENCE.\r\n  A LITTLE CARRIAGE WAS GOT FOR HIM.]\r\n\r\nHe lay in his bed day after day quite happily and patiently, content\r\nto watch and talk to Florence. He would tell her his dreams, and how he\r\nalways saw the sunlit ripples of a river rolling, rolling fast in front\r\nof him; sometimes he seemed to be rocking in a little boat on the water,\r\nand its motion lulled him to rest, and then he would be floating away,\r\naway to that shore farther off, which he could not see. One day he told\r\nFlorence that the water was rippling brighter and faster than ever, and\r\nthat he could not see anything else.\r\n\r\n\"My own boy, cannot you see your poor father?\" said Mr. Dombey, bending\r\nover him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, but don't be so sorry, dear papa. I am so happy,--good-bye,\r\ndear papa.\" Presently he opened his eyes again, and said, \"Floy, mamma\r\nis like you, I can see her. Come close to me, Floy, and tell them,\"\r\nwhispered the dying boy, \"that the face of the picture of Christ on the\r\nstaircase at school is not divine enough; the light from it is shining\r\non me now, and the water is shining too, and rippling so fast, so fast.\"\r\n\r\nThe evening light shone into the room, but little Paul's spirit had gone\r\nout on the rippling water, and the Divine Face was shining on him from\r\nthe farther shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUNAWAY COUPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Supposing a young gentleman not eight years old was to run away with a\r\nfine young woman of seven, would you consider that a queer start? That\r\nthere is a start as I--the boots at the Holly-Tree Inn--have seen with\r\nmy own eyes; and I cleaned the shoes they ran away in, and they was so\r\nlittle that I couldn't get my hand into 'em.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE RUNAWAY COUPLE.]\r\n\r\n\"Master Harry Walmers's father, he lived at the Elms, away by Shooter's\r\nHill, six or seven miles from London. He was uncommon proud of Master\r\nHarry, as was his only child; but he didn't spoil him neither. He was a\r\ngentleman that had a will of his own, and an eye of his own, and that\r\nwould be minded. Consequently, though he made quite a companion of\r\nthe fine bright boy, still he kept the command over him, and the child\r\n_was_ a child. I was under gardener there at that time I and one morning\r\nMaster Harry, he comes to me and says--\r\n\r\n\"'Cobbs, how should you spell Norah, if you were asked?' and he took out\r\nhis little knife and began cutting that name in print all over the\r\nfence. The next day as it might be, he stops, along with Miss Norah,\r\nwhere I was hoeing weeds in the gravel, and says, speaking up--\r\n\r\n\"'Cobbs, I like you! Why do I like you do you think, Cobbs? Because Norah\r\nlikes you.'\r\n\r\n\"'Indeed, sir,' says I. 'That's very gratifying.'\r\n\r\n\"'Gratifying, Cobbs?' says Master Harry. 'It's better than a million of\r\nthe brightest diamonds, to be liked by Norah. You're going away ain't\r\nyou, Cobbs? Then you shall be our head gardener when we're married.' And\r\nhe tucks her, in her little sky-blue mantle, under his arm, and walks\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"I was the boots at this identical Holly-Tree Inn when one summer\r\nafternoon the coach drives up, and out of the coach gets these two\r\nchildren. The young gentleman gets out; hands his lady out; gives the\r\nguard something for himself; says to my governor, the landlord: 'We're\r\nto stop here to-night, please. Sitting room and two bed-rooms will be\r\nrequired. Mutton chops and cherry pudding for two!' and tucks her under\r\nhis arm, and walks into the house, much bolder than brass.\r\n\r\n\"I had seen 'em without their seeing me, and I gave the governor my\r\nviews of the expedition they was upon. 'Cobbs,' says the governor, 'if\r\nthis is so, I must set off myself and quiet their friends' minds. In\r\nwhich case you must keep your eye upon 'em, and humor 'em, until I come\r\nback. But before I take these measures, Cobbs, I should wish you to find\r\nout from themselves whether your opinion is correct.'\r\n\r\n\"So I goes upstairs, and there I finds Master Harry on an e-nor-mous\r\nsofa a-drying the eyes of Miss Norah with his pocket handkercher. Their\r\nlittle legs was entirely off the ground, of course, and it really is not\r\npossible to express how small them children looked. 'It's Cobbs! it's\r\nCobbs!' cries Master Harry, and he comes a-runing to me, and catching\r\nhold of my hand. Miss Norah, she comes running to me on t'other side,\r\nand catching hold of my t'other hand, and they both jump for joy. And\r\nwhat I had took to be the case was the case.\r\n\r\n\"'We're going to be married, Cobbs, at Gretna Green,' says the boy.\r\n'We've run away on purpose. Norah has been in rather low spirits, Cobbs;\r\nbut she'll be happy now we have found you to be our friend.'\r\n\r\n\"'I give you my word and honor upon it that, by way of luggage the lady\r\nhad got a parasol, a smelling-bottle, a round and a half of cold\r\nbuttered toast, eight peppermint drops, and a doll's hair-brush. The\r\ngentleman had got about a dozen yards of string, a knife, three or four\r\nsheets of writing-paper folded up surprisingly small, a orange, and a\r\nchaney mug with his name on it.\r\n\r\n\"'What may be the exact nature of your plans, sir?' says I.\r\n\r\n\"'To go on,' replies the boy, 'in the morning, and be married\r\nto-morrow.'\r\n\r\n\"'Just so, sir. Well, sir, if you will excuse my having the freedom to\r\ngive an opinion, what I should recommend would be this. I'm acquainted\r\nwith a pony, sir, which would take you and Mrs. Harry Walmers junior to\r\nthe end of your journey in a very short space of time. I am not\r\naltogether sure, sir, that the pony will be at liberty to-morrow, but\r\neven if you had to wait for him it might be worth your while.'\r\n\r\n\"They clapped their hands and jumped for joy, and called me 'Good\r\nCobbs!' and 'Dear Cobbs!' and says I, 'Is there anything you want at\r\npresent, sir?'\r\n\r\n\"'We should like some cakes after dinner,' answers Mr. Harry, 'and two\r\napples--and jam. With dinner we should like to have toast and water. But\r\nNorah has always been accustomed to half a glass of currant wine at\r\ndessert, and so have I.'\r\n\r\n\"'They shall be ordered, sir,' I answered, and away I went; and the way\r\nin which all the women in the house went on about that boy and his bold\r\nspirit was a thing to see. They climbed up all sorts of places to get a\r\nlook at him, and they peeped, seven deep, through the keyhole.\r\n\r\n\"In the evening, after the governor had set off for the Elms, I went into\r\nthe room to see how the run-away couple was getting on. The gentleman\r\nwas on the window seat, supporting the lady in his arms. She had tears\r\nupon her face, and was lying very tired and half asleep, with her head\r\nupon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"'Mrs. Harry Walmers junior fatigued, sir?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, she's tired, Cobbs; she's been in low spirits again; she isn't\r\nused to being in a strange place, you see. Could you bring a Norfolk\r\nbiffin, Cobbs? I think that would do her good.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, I fetched the biffin, and Master Harry fed her with a spoon; but\r\nthe lady being heavy with sleep and rather cross, I suggested bed, and\r\ncalled a chambermaid, but Master Harry must needs escort her himself,\r\nand carry the candle for her. After embracing her at her own door he\r\nretired to his room, where I softly locked him in.\r\n\r\n\"They consulted me at breakfast (they had ordered sweet milk and water,\r\nand toast and currant jelly, over night) about the pony, and I told 'em\r\nthat it did unfortunately happen that the pony was half clipped, but\r\nthat he'd be finished clipping in the course of the day, and that\r\nto-morrow morning at eight o'clock he would be ready. My own opinion is\r\nthat Mrs. Harry Walmers junior was beginning to give in. She hadn't had\r\nher hair curled when she went to bed, and she didn't seem quite up to\r\nbrushing it herself, and it getting into her eyes put her out. But\r\nnothing put out Mr. Harry. He sat behind his breakfast cup tearing away\r\nat the jelly, as if he'd been his own father.\r\n\r\n\"In the course of the morning, Master Harry rung the bell,--it was\r\nsurprising how that there boy did carry on,--and said in a sprightly\r\nway, 'Cobbs, is there any good walks in the neighborhood?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, sir, there's Love Lane.'\r\n\r\n\"'Get out with you, Cobbs!'--that was that there mite's\r\nexpression--'you're joking.'\r\n\r\n\"'Begging your pardon, sir, there really is a Love Lane, and a pleasant\r\nwalk it is; and proud shall I be to show it to yourself and Mrs. Harry\r\nWalmers junior.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, I took him down Love Lane to the water meadows, and there Master\r\nHarry would have drowned himself in another minute a getting out a\r\nwater-lily for her. But they was tired out. All being so new and strange\r\nto them, they were as tired as tired could be. And they laid down on a\r\nbank of daisies and fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\"They woke up at last, and then one thing was getting pretty clear to\r\nme, namely, that Mrs. Harry Walmers junior's temper was on the move.\r\nWhen Master Harry took her round the waist, she said he 'teased her so';\r\nand when he says, 'Norah, my young May moon, your Harry tease you?' she\r\ntells him, 'Yes, and I want to go home.'\r\n\r\n\"A boiled fowl, and baked bread and butter pudding, brought Mrs. Walmers\r\nup a little; but I could have wished, I must privately own, to have seen\r\nher more sensible to the voice of love and less abandoning herself to\r\nthe currants in the pudding. However, Master Harry, he kep' up, and his\r\nnoble heart was as fond as ever. Mrs. Walmers turned very sleepy about\r\ndusk, and began to cry. Therefore, Mrs. Walmers went off to bed as per\r\nyesterday; and Master Harry ditto repeated.\r\n\r\n\"About eleven at night comes back the governor in a chaise, along of\r\nMaster Harry's father and a elderly lady. And Master Harry's door being\r\nunlocked by me, Master Harry's father goes in, goes up to the bedside,\r\nbends gently down, and kisses the little sleeping face. Then he stands\r\nlooking at it for a moment, looking wonderfully like it; and then he\r\ngently shakes the little shoulder. 'Harry, my dear boy! Harry!'\r\n\r\n\"Master Harry starts up and looks at his pa. Such is the honor of that\r\nmite, that he looks at me, too, to see whether he has brought me into\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\"'I am not angry, my child. I only want you to dress yourself and come\r\nhome.'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, Pa.' Master Harry dresses himself quick.\r\n\r\n\"'Please may I--please, dear pa--may I--kiss Norah before I go?'\r\n\r\n\"Master Harry's father he takes Master Harry in his hand, and I leads\r\nthe way with the candle to that other bedroom where the elderly lady is\r\nseated by the bed, and poor little Mrs. Harry Walmers junior is fast\r\nasleep. There the father lifts the boy up to the pillow, and he lays his\r\nlittle face down for an instant by the little warm face of poor little\r\nMrs. Harry Walmers junior, and gently draws it to him.\r\n\r\n\"And that's all about it. Master Harry's father drove away in the chaise\r\nhaving hold of Master Harry's hand. The elderly lady Mrs. Harry Walmers\r\njunior that was never to be (she married a captain long after and went\r\nto India) went off next day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOOR JO!\r\n\r\n\r\nJo was a crossing-sweeper; every day he swept up the mud, and begged for\r\npennies from the people who passed. Poor Jo wasn't pretty and he wasn't\r\nclean. His clothes were only a few poor rags that hardly protected him\r\nfrom the cold and the rain. He had never been to school, and he could\r\nneither write nor read--could not even spell his own name.\r\n\r\nPoor Jo! He was ugly and dirty and ignorant; but he knew one thing, that\r\nit was wicked to tell a lie, and knowing this, he always told the truth.\r\nOne other thing poor Jo knew too well, and that was what being hungry\r\nmeans. For little Jo was very poor. He lived in Tom-all-Alones, one of\r\nthe most horrible places in all London. The people who live in this\r\ndreadful den are the poorest of London poor. All miserably clad, all\r\ndirty, all very hungry. They know and like Jo, for he is always willing\r\nto go on errands for them, and does them many little acts of kindness.\r\n\r\nNo one in Tom-all-Alones is spoken of by his name. Thus it is that if\r\nyou inquired there for a boy named Jo, you would be asked whether you\r\nmeant Carrots, or the Colonel, or Gallows, or young Chisel, or Terrier\r\nTip, or Lanky, or the Brick.\r\n\r\nJo was generally called Toughy, although a few superior persons who\r\naffected a dignified style of speaking called him \"the tough subject.\"\r\n\r\nJo used to say he had never had but one friend.\r\n\r\nIt was one cold Winter night, when he was shivering in a door-way near\r\nhis crossing, that a dark-haired, rough-bearded man turned to look at\r\nhim, and then came back and began to talk to him.\r\n\r\n\"Have you a friend, boy?\" he asked presently.\r\n\r\n\"No, never 'ad none.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither have I. Not one. Take this, and Good-night,\" and so saying the\r\nman, who looked very poor and shabby, put into Jo's hand the price of a\r\nsupper and a night's lodging.\r\n\r\nOften afterwards the stranger would stop to talk with Jo, and give him\r\nmoney, Jo firmly believed, whenever he had any to give. When he had\r\nnone, he would merely say, \"I am as poor as you are to-day, Jo,\" and\r\npass on.\r\n\r\nOne day, Jo was fetched away from his crossing to a public-house, where\r\nthe Coroner was holding an Inquest--an \"Inkwich\" Jo called it.\r\n\r\n\"Did the boy know the deceased?\" asked the Coroner.\r\n\r\nIndeed Jo had known him; it was his only friend who was dead.\r\n\r\n\"He was very good to me, he was,\" was all poor Jo could say.\r\n\r\nThe next day they buried the dead man in the churchyard hard by.\r\n\r\nBut that night there came a slouching figure through the court to the\r\niron gate. It stood looking in for a little while, then with an old\r\nbroom it softly swept the step and made the archway clean. It was poor\r\nJo; and as he went away, he softly said to himself, \"He was very good to\r\nme, he was.\"\r\n\r\nNow, there happened to be at the Inquest a kind-hearted little man named\r\nSnagsby, and he pitied Jo so much that he gave him half-a-crown.\r\n\r\nJo was very sad after the death of his one friend. The more so as his\r\nfriend had died in great poverty and misery, with no one near him to\r\ncare whether he lived or not.\r\n\r\nA few days after the funeral, while Jo was still living on Mr. Snagsby's\r\nhalf-crown, he was standing at his crossing as the day closed in, when a\r\nlady, closely veiled and plainly dressed, came up to him.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the boy Jo who was examined at the Inquest?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"That's me,\" said Jo.\r\n\r\n\"Come farther up the court, I want to speak to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wot, about him as was dead? Did you know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"How dare you ask me if I knew him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No offence, my lady,\" said Jo humbly.\r\n\r\n\"Listen and hold your tongue. Show me the place where he lived, then\r\nwhere he died, then where they buried him. Go in front of me, don't look\r\nback once, and I'll pay you well.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: JO AND THE POLICEMAN.\r\n  \"I'M ALWAYS A MOVING ON.\"]\r\n\r\nJo takes her to each of the places she wants to see. Then she draws off\r\nher glove, and Jo sees that she has sparkling rings on her fingers. She\r\ndrops a coin into his hand and is gone. Jo holds the coin to the light\r\nand sees to his joy that it is a golden sovereign.\r\n\r\nBut people in Jo's position in life find it hard to change a sovereign,\r\nfor who will believe that they can come by it honestly? So poor little\r\nJo didn't get much of the sovereign for himself, for, as he afterwards\r\ntold Mr. Snagsby--\r\n\r\n\"I had to pay five bob down in Tom-all-Alones before they'd square it\r\nfor to give me change, and then a young man he thieved another five\r\nwhile I was asleep, and a boy he thieved ninepence, and the landlord he\r\nstood drains round with a lot more of it.\"\r\n\r\nAs time went on Jo's troubles began in earnest. The police turned him\r\naway from his crossing, and wheresoever they met him ordered him \"to\r\nmove on.\"\r\n\r\nOnce a policeman, angry to find that Jo hadn't moved on, seized him by\r\nthe arm and dragged him down to Mr. Snagsby's.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, constable?\" asked Mr. Snagsby.\r\n\r\n\"This boy's as obstinate a young gonoph as I know: although repeatedly\r\ntold to, he won't move on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm always amoving on,\" cried Jo. \"Oh, my eye, where am I to move to?\"\r\n\r\n\"My instructions don't go to that,\" the constable answered; \"my\r\ninstructions are that you're to keep moving on. Now the simple question\r\nis, sir,\" turning to Mr. Snagsby, \"whether you know him. He says you\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I leave him here; but mind you keep moving on.\"\r\n\r\nThe constable then moved on himself, leaving Jo at Mr. Snagsby's. There\r\nwas a little tea-party there that evening, and when Jo was at last\r\nallowed to go, Mr. Snagsby followed him to the door and filled his hands\r\nwith the remains of the little feast they had had upstairs.\r\n\r\nAnd now Jo began to find life harder and rougher than ever. He lost his\r\ncrossing altogether, and spent day after day in moving on. He remembered\r\na poor woman he had once done a kindness to, who had told him she lived\r\nat St. Albans, and that a lady there had been very good to her. \"Perhaps\r\nshe'll be good to me,\" thought Jo, and he started off to go to St.\r\nAlbans.\r\n\r\nOne Saturday night Jo reached that town very tired and very ill. Happily\r\nfor him the woman met him and took him into her cottage. While he was\r\nresting there a lady came in and asked him very kindly what was the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\"I'm abeing froze and then burnt up, and then froze and burnt up again,\r\never so many times over in an hour. And my head's all sleepy, and all\r\nagoing round like, and I'm so dry, and my bones is nothing half so much\r\nbones as pain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"Somewheres,\" replied Jo, \"I'm a-being moved on, I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, to-night you must come with me, and I'll make you comfortable.\"\r\nSo Jo went with the lady to a great house not far off, and there they\r\nmade a bed for him, and brought him tempting wholesome food. Everyone\r\nwas very kind to him, but something frightened Jo, and he felt he could\r\nnot stay there, and he ran out into the cold night air. Where he went he\r\ncould never remember, for when he next came to his senses he found\r\nhimself in a hospital. He stayed there for some weeks, and was then\r\ndischarged, though still weak and ill. He was very thin, and when he\r\ndrew a breath his chest was very painful. \"It draws,\" said Jo, \"as heavy\r\nas a cart.\"\r\n\r\nNow, a certain young doctor who was very kind to poor people, was\r\nwalking through Tom-all-Alones one morning, when he saw a ragged figure\r\ncoming along, crouching close to the dirty wall. It was Jo. The young\r\ndoctor took pity on Jo. \"Come with me,\" he said, \"and I will find you a\r\nbetter place than this to stay in,\" for he saw that the lad was very,\r\nvery ill. So Jo was taken to a clean little room, and bathed, and had\r\nclean clothes, and good food, and kind people about him once more, but\r\nhe was too ill now, far too ill, for anything to do him any good.\r\n\r\n\"Let me lie here quiet,\" said poor Jo, \"and be so kind anyone as is\r\npassin' nigh where I used to sweep, as to say to Mr. Snagsby as Jo, wot\r\nhe knew once, is amoving on.\"\r\n\r\nOne day the young doctor was sitting by him, when suddenly Jo made a\r\nstrong effort to get out of bed.\r\n\r\n\"Stay, Jo--where now?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's time for me to go to that there burying-ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"What burying-ground, Jo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where they laid him as was very good to me, very good to me indeed he\r\nwas. It's time for me to go down to that there burying-ground, sir, and\r\nask to be put along of him. I wants to go there and be buried. Will you\r\npromise to have me took there and laid along with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thankee, sir. There's a step there as I used to sweep with my broom.\r\nIt's turned very dark, sir, is there any light coming?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's coming fast, Jo.\"\r\n\r\nThen silence for a while.\r\n\r\n\"Jo, my poor fellow----!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can hear you, sir, in the dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jo, can you say what I say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll say anything you say, sir, for I knows it's good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our Father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our Father--yes, that's very good, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which art in Heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Art in Heaven. Is the light a-coming, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's close at hand. Hallowed be Thy name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hallowed be Thy\"--\r\n\r\nThe light had come. Oh yes! the light had come, for Jo was dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE KENWIGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Kenwigs was the wife of an ivory turner, and though they only had a\r\nvery humble home of two rooms in a dingy-looking house in a small\r\nstreet, they had great pretensions to being \"genteel.\" The little Miss\r\nKenwigs had their flaxen hair plaited into pig-tails and tied with blue\r\nribbons, and wore little white trousers with frills round their ankles,\r\nthe highest fashion of that day; besides being dressed with such\r\nelegance, the two eldest girls went twice a week to a dancing school.\r\nMrs. Kenwigs, too, had an uncle who collected the water rate, and she\r\nwas therefore considered a person of great distinction, with quite the\r\nmanners of a lady. On the eighth anniversary of their wedding day, Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Kenwigs invited a party of friends to supper to celebrate the\r\noccasion. The four eldest children were to be allowed to sit up to\r\nsupper, and the uncle, Mr. Lillyvick, had promised to come. The baby was\r\nput to bed in a little room lent by one of the lady guests, and a little\r\ngirl hired to watch him. All the company had assembled when a ring was\r\nheard, and Morleena, whose name had been _invented by Mrs. Kenwigs_\r\nspecially for her, ran down to open the door and lead in her\r\ndistinguished great-uncle, then the supper was brought in.\r\n\r\nThe table was cleared; Mr. Lillyvick established in the arm-chair by the\r\nfireside; the four little girls arranged on a small form in front of the\r\ncompany with their flaxen tails towards them; Mrs. Kenwigs was suddenly\r\ndissolved in tears and sobbed out--\r\n\r\n\"They are so beautiful!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear,\" said all the ladies, \"so they are; it's very natural you\r\nshould feel proud of that; but don't give way, don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can--not help it, and it don't signify,\" sobbed Mrs. Kenwigs: \"oh!\r\nthey're too beautiful to live, much too beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing this dismal prophecy, all four little girls screamed until\r\ntheir light flaxen tails vibrated again, and rushed to bury their heads\r\nin their mother's lap.\r\n\r\nAt length she was soothed, and the children calmed down; while the\r\nladies and gentlemen all said they were sure they would live for many\r\nmany years, and there was no occasion for their mother's distress: and\r\nas the children were not so remarkably lovely, this was quite true.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Lillyvick talked to the company about his niece's marriage, and\r\nsaid graciously that he had always found Mr. Kenwigs a very honest,\r\nwell-behaved, upright, and respectable sort of man, and shook hands with\r\nhim, and then Morleena and her sisters kissed their uncle and most of\r\nthe guests.\r\n\r\nThen Miss Petowker, who could sing and recite in a way that brought\r\ntears to Mrs. Kenwigs' eyes, remarked--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear Mrs. Kenwigs, while Mr. Noggs is making that punch to drink\r\nhappy returns in, do let Morleena go through that figure dance before\r\nMr. Lillyvick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll tell you what,\" said Mrs. Kenwigs. \"Morleena shall do the\r\nsteps, if uncle can persuade Miss Petowker to recite us the\r\n'Blood-Drinker's Burial' afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone clapped their hands and stamped their feet at this proposal,\r\nbut Miss Petowker said, \"You know I dislike doing anything professional\r\nat private parties.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but not here!\" said Mrs. Kenwigs. \"You might as well be going\r\nthrough it in your own room: besides, the occasion.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't resist that,\" interrupted Miss Petowker, \"anything in my humble\r\npower, I shall be delighted to do.\"\r\n\r\nIn reality Mrs. Kenwigs and Miss Petowker had arranged all the\r\nentertainment between them beforehand, but had settled that a little\r\npressing on each side would look more natural. Then Miss Petowker hummed\r\na tune, and Morleena danced. It was a very beautiful figure, with a\r\ngreat deal of work for the arms, and gained much applause. Then Miss\r\nPetowker was entreated to begin her recitation, so she let down her back\r\nhair, and went through the performance with great spirit, and died\r\nraving mad in the arms of a bachelor friend who was to rush out and\r\ncatch her at the words \"in death expire,\" to the great delight of the\r\naudience and the terror of the little Kenwigses, who were nearly\r\nfrightened into fits.\r\n\r\nJust as the punch was ready, a knock at the door startled them all. But\r\nit was only a friend of Mr. Noggs, who lived upstairs, and who had come\r\ndown to say that Mr. Noggs was wanted.\r\n\r\nMr. Noggs hurried out, saying he would be back soon, and presently\r\nstartled them all by rushing in, snatching up a candle and a tumbler of\r\nhot punch, and darting out again.\r\n\r\nNow, it happened unfortunately that the tumbler of punch was the very\r\none that Mr. Lillyvick was just going to lift to his lips, and the great\r\nman--the rich relation--who had it in his power to make Morleena and her\r\nsisters heiresses--and whom everyone was most anxious to please--was\r\noffended.\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Kenwigs endeavored to soothe him, but only made matters worse.\r\nMr. Lillyvick demanded his hat, and was only induced to remain by Mrs.\r\nKenwigs' tears and the entreaties of the entire company.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE LITTLE KENWIGS.\r\n  \"THEY ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.\"]\r\n\r\n\"There, Kenwigs,\" said Mr. Lillyvick, \"and let me tell you, to show you\r\nhow much out of temper I was, that if I had gone away without another\r\nword, it would have made no difference respecting that pound or two\r\nwhich I shall leave among your children when I die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Morleena Kenwigs,\" cried her mother, \"go down on your knees to your\r\ndear uncle, and beg him to love you all his life through; for he's more\r\nan angel than a man, and I've always said so.\"\r\n\r\nJust as all were happy again, everyone was startled by a rapid\r\nsuccession of the loudest and shrillest shrieks, apparently coming from\r\nthe room where the baby was asleep.\r\n\r\n\"My baby, my blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed baby! My own darling,\r\nsweet, innocent Lillyvick! Let me go-o-o-o,\" screamed Mrs. Kenwigs.\r\n\r\nMr. Kenwigs rushed out, and was met at the door of the bedroom by a\r\nyoung man with the baby (upside down) in his arms, who came out so\r\nquickly that he knocked Mr. Kenwigs down; handing the child to his\r\nmother, he said, \"Don't be alarmed, it's all out, it's all over--the\r\nlittle girl, being tired, I suppose, fell asleep and set her hair on\r\nfire. I heard her cries and ran up in time to prevent her setting fire\r\nto anything else. The child is not hurt: I took it off the bed myself\r\nand brought it here to convince you.\"\r\n\r\nAfter they had all talked over this last excitement, and discussed\r\nlittle Lillyvick's deliverer, the collector pulled out his watch and\r\nannounced that it was nearly two o'clock, and as the poor children had\r\nbeen for some time obliged to keep their little eyes open with their\r\nlittle forefingers, the company took leave, declaring they had never\r\nspent such a delightful evening, and that they wished Mr. and Mrs.\r\nKenwigs had a wedding-day once a week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE DORRIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany years ago, when people could be put in prison for debt, a poor\r\ngentleman, who was unfortunate enough to lose all his money, was brought\r\nto the Marshalsea prison. As there seemed no prospect of being able to\r\npay his debts, his wife and their two little children came to live there\r\nwith him. The elder child was a boy of three; the younger a little girl\r\nof two years old, and not long afterwards another little girl was born.\r\nThe three children played in the courtyard, and were happy, on the\r\nwhole, for they were too young to remember a happier state of things.\r\n\r\nBut the youngest child, who had never been outside the prison walls, was\r\na thoughtful little creature, and wondered what the outside world could\r\nbe like. Her great friend, the turnkey, who was also her godfather,\r\nbecame very fond of her, and as soon as she could walk and talk, he\r\nbought a little arm-chair and stood it by his fire at the lodge, and\r\ncoaxed her with cheap toys to come and sit with him.\r\n\r\nOne day, she was sitting in the lodge gazing wistfully up at the sky\r\nthrough the barred window. The turnkey, after watching her some time,\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"Thinking of the fields, ain't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are they?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Why, they're--over there, my dear,\" said the turnkey, waving his key\r\nvaguely, \"just about there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does anybody open them and shut them? Are they locked?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the turnkey, discomfited, \"not in general.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they pretty, Bob?\" She called him Bob, because he wished it.\r\n\r\n\"Lovely. Full of flowers. There's buttercups, and there's daisies, and\r\nthere's--\" here he hesitated, not knowing the names of many\r\nflowers--\"there's dandelions, and all manner of games.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it very pleasant to be there, Bob?\"\r\n\r\n\"Prime,\" said the turnkey.\r\n\r\n\"Was father ever there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hem!\" coughed the turnkey. \"O yes, he was there, sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he sorry not to be there now?\"\r\n\r\n\"N--not particular,\" said the turnkey.\r\n\r\n\"Nor any of the people?\" she asked, glancing at the listless crowd\r\nwithin. \"O are you quite sure and certain, Bob?\"\r\n\r\nAt this point, Bob gave in and changed the subject. But after this chat,\r\nthe turnkey and little Amy would go out on his free Sunday afternoons to\r\nsome meadows or green lanes, and she would pick grass and flowers to\r\nbring home, while he smoked his pipe.\r\n\r\nWhen Amy was only eight years old, her mother died, and the poor father\r\nwas more helpless and broken-down than ever, and as Fanny was a careless\r\nchild, and Edward idle, the little one, who had the bravest and truest\r\nheart, was inspired by her love and unselfishness to be the little\r\nmother of the forlorn family, and struggled to get some little education\r\nfor herself and her brother and sister. She went as often as she could\r\nto an evening school outside, and managed to get her brother and sister\r\nsent to a day-school at intervals, during three or four years. At\r\nthirteen, she could read and keep accounts. Once, amongst the debtors, a\r\ndancing-master came in, and as Fanny had a great desire to learn\r\ndancing, little Amy went timidly to the new prisoner, and said,\r\n\r\n\"If you please, I was born here, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! You are the young lady, are you?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what can I do for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing for me, sir, thank you; but if, while you stay here, you could\r\nbe so kind as to teach my sister cheap.\"\r\n\r\n\"My child, I'll teach her for nothing,\" said the dancing-master.\r\n\r\nFanny was a very apt pupil, and the good-natured dancing-master went on\r\ngiving her lessons even after his release, and Amy was so emboldened\r\nwith the success of her attempt that, when a milliner came in, she went\r\nto her on her own behalf, and begged her to teach her.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid you are so weak, you see,\" the milliner objected.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I am weak, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are so very, very little, you see,\" the milliner still\r\nobjected.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE BLIND TOY MAKER.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LITTLE DORRIT AND MAGGIE.\r\n  \"SHE HAS NEVER GROWN OLDER SINCE.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am afraid I am very little indeed,\" returned the child, and\r\nbegan to sob, so that the milliner was touched, and took her in hand and\r\nmade her a clever workwoman.\r\n\r\nBut the father could not bear the idea that his children should work for\r\ntheir living, so they had to keep it all secret. Fanny became a dancer,\r\nand lived with a poor old uncle, who played the clarionet at the small\r\ntheatre where Fanny was engaged. Amy, or little Dorrit as she was\r\ngenerally called, her father's name being Dorrit, earned small sums by\r\ngoing out to do needlework. She got Edward into a great many situations,\r\nbut he was an idle, careless fellow, and always came back to be a burden\r\nand care to his poor little sister. At last she saved up enough to send\r\nhim out to Canada.\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, dear Tip\" (his name had been shortened to Tip), \"don't\r\nbe too proud to come and see us when you have made your fortune,\" she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nBut Tip only went as far as Liverpool, and appeared once more before his\r\npoor little second mother, in rags, and with no shoes.\r\n\r\nIn the end, after another trial, Tip returned telling Amy, that this\r\ntime he was \"one of the regulars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Don't say you are a prisoner, Tip. Don't, don't!\"\r\n\r\nBut he was--and Amy nearly broke her heart. So with all these cares and\r\nworries struggling bravely on, little Dorrit passed the first twenty-two\r\nyears of her life. Then the son of a lady, Mrs. Clennem, to whose house\r\nAmy went to do needlework, was interested in the pale, patient little\r\ncreature, and learning her history resolved to do his best to try and\r\nget her father released, and to help them all.\r\n\r\nOne day when he was walking home with little Dorrit a voice was heard\r\ncalling, \"Little Mother, Little Mother,\" and a strange figure came\r\nbouncing up to them and fell down, scattering her basketful of potatoes\r\non the ground. \"Oh Maggie,\" said Little Dorrit, \"what a clumsy child you\r\nare!\"\r\n\r\nShe was about eight and twenty, with large bones, large features, large\r\nhands and feet, large eyes and no hair. Little Dorrit told Mr. Clennem\r\nthat Maggie was the grand-daughter of her old nurse, and that her\r\ngrandmother had been very unkind to her and beat her. \"When Maggie was\r\nten years old, she had a fever, and she has never grown older since.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten years old,\" said Maggie. \"But what a nice hospital! So comfortable\r\nwasn't it? Such a Ev'nly place! Such beds there is there! Such\r\nlemonades! Such oranges! Such delicious broth and wine! Such chicking!\r\nOh, AIN'T it a delightful place to stop at!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then when she came out, her grandmother did not know what to do with\r\nher, and was very unkind. But after some time, Maggie tried to improve,\r\nand was very attentive and industrious, and now she can earn her own\r\nliving entirely, sir!\"\r\n\r\nLittle Dorrit did not say who had taken pains to teach and encourage the\r\npoor half-witted creature, but Mr. Clennem guessed from the name Little\r\nMother, and the fondness of the poor creature for Amy.\r\n\r\nThanks to Mr. Clennem, a great change took place in the fortunes of the\r\nfamily, and not long after this wretched night, it was discovered that\r\nMr. Dorrit was owner of a large property, and they became very rich.\r\n\r\nWhen, in his turn, Mr. Clennem became a prisoner in the Marshalsea\r\nlittle Dorrit came to comfort and console him, and after many changes of\r\nfortune, she became his wife, and they lived happy ever after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLIND TOY-MAKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaleb Plummer and his blind daughter lived alone in a little cracked\r\nnutshell of a house. They were toy-makers, and their house was stuck\r\nlike a toadstool on to the premises of Messrs. Gruff & Tackleton, the\r\nToy Merchants for whom they worked,--the latter of whom was himself both\r\nGruff and Tackleton in one.\r\n\r\nI am saying that Caleb and his blind daughter lived here. I should say\r\nCaleb did, his daughter lived in an enchanted palace, which her father's\r\nlove had created for her. She did not know that the ceilings were\r\ncracked, the plaster tumbling down, and the wood work rotten; that\r\neverything was old and ugly and poverty-stricken about her and that her\r\nfather was a grey-haired stooping old man, and the master for whom they\r\nworked a hard and brutal taskmaster;--oh, dear no, she fancied a pretty,\r\ncosy, compact little home full of tokens of a kind master's care, a\r\nsmart, brisk, gallant-looking father, and a handsome and noble-looking\r\nToy Merchant who was an angel of goodness.\r\n\r\nThis was all Caleb's doings. When his blind daughter was a baby he had\r\ndetermined in his great love and pity for her, that her deprivation\r\nshould be turned into a blessing, and her life as happy as he could make\r\nit. And she was happy; everything about her she saw with her father's\r\neyes, in the rainbow-coloured light with which it was his care and\r\npleasure to invest it.\r\n\r\nBertha sat busily at work, making a doll's frock, whilst Caleb bent over\r\nthe opposite side of the table painting a doll's house.\r\n\r\n\"You were out in the rain last night in your beautiful new great-coat,\"\r\nsaid Bertha.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in my beautiful new great-coat,\" answered Caleb, glancing to where\r\na roughly made garment of sack-cloth was hung up to dry.\r\n\r\n\"How glad I am you bought it, father.\"\r\n\r\n\"And of such a tailor! quite a fashionable tailor, a bright blue cloth,\r\nwith bright buttons; it's a deal too good a coat for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too good!\" cried the blind girl, stopping to laugh and clap her\r\nhands--\"as if anything was too good for my handsome father, with his\r\nsmiling face, and black hair, and his straight figure.\"\r\n\r\nCaleb began to sing a rollicking song.\r\n\r\n\"What, you are singing, are you?\" growled a gruff voice, as Mr.\r\nTackleton put his head in at the door. \"_I_ can't afford to sing, I hope\r\nyou can afford to work too. Hardly time for both, I should say.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't see how the master is winking at me,\" whispered Caleb in his\r\ndaughter's ear--\"such a joke, pretending to scold, you know.\"\r\n\r\nThe blind girl laughed and nodded, and taking Mr. Tackleton's reluctant\r\nhand, kissed it gently. \"What is the idiot doing?\" grumbled the Toy\r\nMerchant, pulling his hand roughly away.\r\n\r\n\"I am thanking you for the beautiful little tree,\" replied Bertha,\r\nbringing forward a tiny rose-tree in blossom, which Caleb had made her\r\nbelieve was her master's gift, though he himself had gone without a meal\r\nor two to buy it.\r\n\r\n\"Here's Bedlam broke loose. What does the idiot mean?\" snarled Mr.\r\nTackleton; and giving Caleb some rough orders, he departed without the\r\npoliteness of a farewell.\r\n\r\n\"If you could only have seen him winking at me all the time, pretending\r\nto be so rough to escape thanking,\" exclaimed Caleb, when the door was\r\nshut.\r\n\r\nNow a very sad and curious thing had happened. Caleb, in his love for\r\nBertha, had so successfully deceived her as to the real character of Mr.\r\nTackleton, that she had fallen in love, not with her master, but with\r\nwhat she imagined him to be, and was happy in an innocent belief in his\r\naffection for her; but one day she accidently heard he was going to be\r\nmarried, and could not hide from her father the pain and bewilderment\r\nshe felt at the news.\r\n\r\n\"Bertha, my dear,\" said Caleb at length, \"I have a confession to make to\r\nyou; hear me kindly though I have been cruel to you.\" \"You cruel to me!\"\r\ncried Bertha, turning her sightless face towards him. \"Not meaning it,\r\nmy child! and I never suspected it till the other day. I have concealed\r\nthings from you which would have given pain, I have invented things to\r\nplease you, and have surrounded you with fancies.\"\r\n\r\n\"But living people are not fancies, father, you cannot change them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have done so, my child, God forgive me! Bertha, the man who is\r\nmarried to-day is a hard master to us both, ugly in his looks and in his\r\nnature, and hard and heartless as he can be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh heavens! how blind I have been, how could you father, and I so\r\nhelpless!\" Poor Caleb hung his head.\r\n\r\n\"Answer me father,\" said Bertha. \"What is my home like?\"\r\n\r\n\"A poor place, Bertha, a very poor and bare place! indeed as little able\r\nto keep out wind and weather as my sackcloth coat.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the presents that I took such care of, that came at my wish, and\r\nwere so dearly welcome?\" Caleb did not answer.\r\n\r\n\"I see, I understand,\" said Bertha, \"and now I am looking at you, at my\r\nkind, loving compassionate father, tell me what is he like?\"\r\n\r\n\"An old man, my child, thin, bent, grey-haired, worn-out with hard work\r\nand sorrow, a weak, foolish, deceitful old man.\"\r\n\r\nThe blind girl threw herself on her knees before him, and took his grey\r\nhead in her arms. \"It is my sight, it is my sight restored,\" she cried.\r\n\"I have been blind, but now I see, I have never till now truly seen my\r\nfather. Father, there is not a grey hair on your head that shall be\r\nforgotten in my prayers and thanks to Heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"My Bertha!\" sobbed Caleb, \"and the brisk smart father in the blue\r\ncoat--he's gone, my child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dearest father, no, he's not gone, nothing is gone. I have been happy\r\nand contented, but I shall be happier and more contented still, now that\r\nI know what you are. I am _not_ blind, father, any longer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE NELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe house was one of those receptacles for old and curious things, which\r\nseem to crouch in odd corners of the town; and in the old, dark, murky\r\nrooms, there lived alone together an old man and a child--his\r\ngrandchild, little Nell. Solitary and monotonous as was her life, the\r\ninnocent and cheerful spirit of the child found happiness in all things,\r\nand through the dim rooms of the old curiosity shop little Nell went\r\nsinging, moving with gay and lightsome step.\r\n\r\nBut gradually over the old man, to whom she was so tenderly attached,\r\nthere stole a sad change. He became thoughtful, dejected, and wretched.\r\nHe had no sleep or rest but that which he took by day in his easy chair;\r\nfor every night, and all night long, he was away from home.\r\n\r\nAt last a raging fever seized him, and as he lay delirious or insensible\r\nthrough many weeks, Nell learned that the house which sheltered them was\r\ntheirs no longer; that in the future they would be very poor; that they\r\nwould scarcely have bread to eat.\r\n\r\nAt length the old man began to mend, but his mind was weakened. As the\r\ntime drew near when they must leave the house, he made no reference to\r\nthe necessity of finding other shelter. But a change came upon him one\r\nevening, as he and Nell sat silently together.\r\n\r\n\"Let us speak softly, Nell,\" he said. \"Hush! for if they knew our\r\npurpose they would say that I was mad, and take thee from me. We will\r\nnot stop here another day. We will travel afoot through the fields and\r\nwoods, and trust ourselves to God in the places where He dwells.\"\r\n\r\nThe child's heart beat high with hope and confidence. To her it seemed\r\nthat they might beg their way from door to door in happiness, so that\r\nthey were together.\r\n\r\nWhen the day began to glimmer they stole out of the house, and passing\r\ninto the street stood still.\r\n\r\n\"Which way?\" asked the child.\r\n\r\nThe old man looked irresolutely and helplessly at her, and shook his\r\nhead. It was plain that she was thenceforth his guide and leader. The\r\nchild felt it, but had no doubts or misgivings, and putting her hand in\r\nhis, led him gently away.\r\n\r\nThey passed through the long, deserted streets, until these streets\r\ndwindled away, and the open country was about them. They walked all day,\r\nand slept that night at a small cottage where beds were let to\r\ntravellers. The sun was setting on the second day of their journey,\r\nwhen, following a path which led to the town where they were to spend\r\nthe night, they fell in with two travelling showmen, bound for the races\r\nat a neighboring town.\r\n\r\nThey made two long days' journey with their new companions. The men were\r\nrough and strange in their ways, but they were kindly, too; and in the\r\nbewildering noise and movement of the race-course, where she tried to\r\nsell some little nosegays, Nell would have clung to them for protection,\r\nhad she not learned that these men suspected that she and the old man\r\nhad left their home secretly, and that they meant to take steps to have\r\nthem sent back and taken care of. Separation from her grandfather was\r\nthe greatest evil Nell could dread. She seized her opportunity to evade\r\nthe watchfulness of the two men, and hand in hand she and the old man\r\nfled away together.\r\n\r\nThat night they reached a little village in a woody hollow. The village\r\nschoolmaster, attracted by the child's sweetness and modesty, gave them\r\na lodging for the night; nor would he let them leave him until two days\r\nmore had passed.\r\n\r\nThey journeyed on when the time came that they must wander forth again,\r\nby pleasant country lanes. The afternoon had worn away into a beautiful\r\nevening, when they came to a caravan drawn up by the road. It was a\r\nsmart little house upon wheels, and at the door sat a stout and\r\ncomfortable lady, taking tea. The tea-things were set out upon a drum,\r\ncovered with a white napkin. And there, as if at the most convenient\r\ntable in the world, sat this roving lady, taking her tea and enjoying\r\nthe prospect. Of this stout lady Nell ventured to ask how far it was to\r\nthe neighboring town. And the lady, noticing that the tired child could\r\nhardly repress a tear at hearing that eight weary miles lay still before\r\nthem, not only gave them tea, but offered to take them on in the\r\ncaravan.\r\n\r\nNow this lady of the caravan was the owner of a wax-work show, and her\r\nname was Mrs. Jarley. She offered Nell employment in pointing out the\r\nfigures in the wax-work show to the visitors who came to see it,\r\npromising in return both board and lodging for the child and her\r\ngrandfather, and some small sum of money. This offer Nell was thankful\r\nto accept, and for some time her life and that of the poor, vacant, fond\r\nold man, passed quietly and almost happily.\r\n\r\nOne night Nell and her grandfather went out to walk. A terrible\r\nthunder-storm coming on, they were forced to take refuge in a small\r\npublic-house where men played cards. The old man watched them with\r\nincreasing interest and excitement, until his whole appearance underwent\r\na complete change. His face was flushed and eager, his teeth set. He\r\nseized Nell's little purse, and in spite of her entreaties joined in the\r\ngame, gambling with such a savage thirst for gain that the distressed\r\nand frightened child could almost better have borne to see him dead. The\r\nnight was far advanced before the play came to an end, and they were\r\nforced to remain where they were until the morning. And in the night the\r\nchild was awakened from her troubled sleep to find a figure in the room.\r\nIt was her grandfather himself, his white face pinched and sharpened by\r\nthe greediness which made his eyes unnaturally bright, counting the\r\nmoney of which his hands were robbing her.\r\n\r\nEvening after evening, after that night, the old man would steal away,\r\nnot to return until the night was far spent, demanding, wildly, money.\r\nAnd at last there came an hour when the child overheard him, tempted\r\nbeyond his feeble powers of resistence, undertake to find more money to\r\nfeed the desperate passion which had laid hold upon his weakness by\r\nrobbing Mrs. Jarley.\r\n\r\nThat night the child took her grandfather by the hand and led him forth;\r\nsustained by one idea--that they were flying from disgrace and crime,\r\nand that her grandfather's preservation must depend solely upon her\r\nfirmness; the old man following as though she had been an angel\r\nmessenger sent to lead him where she would.\r\n\r\nThey slept in the open air that night, and on the following morning some\r\nmen offered to take them a long distance on their barge. These men,\r\nthough they were not unkindly, drank and quarrelled among themselves, to\r\nNell's inexpressible terror. It rained, too, heavily, and she was wet\r\nand cold. At last they reached the great city whither the barge was\r\nbound, and here they wandered up and down, being now penniless, and\r\nwatched the faces of those who passed, to find among them a ray of\r\nencouragement or hope.\r\n\r\nThey laid down that night, and the next night too, with nothing between\r\nthem and the sky; a penny loaf was all they had had that day, and when\r\nthe third morning came, it found the child much weaker, yet she made no\r\ncomplaint. Faint and spiritless as they were, the streets were\r\ninsupportable; and the child, throughout the remainder of that hard day,\r\ncompelled herself to press on, that they might reach the country.\r\nEvening was drawing on; they were dragging themselves through the last\r\nstreet. Seeing a traveller on foot before them, she shot on before her\r\ngrandfather and began in a few faint words to implore the stranger's\r\nhelp. He turned his head, the child uttered a wild shriek, and fell\r\nsenseless at his feet. It was the village schoolmaster who had been so\r\nkind to them before.\r\n\r\nThe good man took her in his arms and carried her quickly to a little\r\ninn hard by, where she was tenderly put to bed and where a doctor\r\narrived with all speed. The schoolmaster, as it appeared, was on his way\r\nto a new home. And when the child had recovered somewhat from her\r\nexhaustion, it was arranged that she and her grandfather should\r\naccompany him to the village whither he was bound, and that he should\r\nendeavor to find them some humble occupation by which they could\r\nsubsist.\r\n\r\nIt was a secluded village, lying among the quiet country scenes Nell\r\nloved. And here, her grandfather being tranquil and at rest, a great\r\npeace fell upon the spirit of the child. Often she would steal into the\r\nchurch, and sit down among the quiet figures carved upon the tombs. What\r\nif the spot awakened thoughts of death? It would be no pain to sleep\r\nhere. For the time was drawing nearer every day when Nell was to rest\r\nindeed. She never murmured or complained, but faded like a light upon a\r\nsummer's evening and died. Day after day and all day long, the old man,\r\nbroken-hearted and with no love or care for anything in life, would sit\r\nbeside her grave with her straw hat and the little basket she had been\r\nused to carry, waiting till she should come to him again. At last they\r\nfound him lying dead upon the stone. And in the church where they had\r\noften prayed and mused and lingered, hand in hand, the child and the old\r\nman slept together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE DAVID COPPERFIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle David Copperfield lived with his mother in a pretty house in the\r\nvillage of Blunderstone in Suffolk. His father died before David could\r\nremember anything and he had neither brothers nor sisters. He was fondly\r\nloved by his pretty young mother, and their kind, good servant Peggotty,\r\nand David was a very happy little fellow. They had very few friends, and\r\nthe only relation Mrs. Copperfield talked about was an aunt of David's\r\nfather, a tall and rather terrible old lady, from all accounts. One\r\nvisitor, a tall dark gentleman, David did not like at all, and he was\r\nrather inclined to be jealous that his mother should be friendly with\r\nthe stranger.\r\n\r\nOne day Peggotty, the servant, asked David if he would like to go with\r\nher on a visit to her brother at Yarmouth.\r\n\r\n\"Is your brother an agreeable man, Peggotty?\" he enquired.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what an agreeable man he is!\" cried Peggotty. \"Then there's the\r\nsea, and the boats and ships, and the fishermen, and the beach. And 'Am\r\nto play with.\"\r\n\r\nHam was her nephew. David was quite anxious to go when he heard of all\r\nthese delights; but his mother, what would she do all alone? Peggotty\r\ntold him his mother was going to pay a visit to some friends, and would\r\nbe sure to let him go. So all was arranged, and they were to start the\r\nnext day in the carrier's cart. When they arrived at Yarmouth, they\r\nfound Ham waiting to meet them. He was a great strong fellow, six feet\r\nhigh, and took David on his back and the box under his arm to carry both\r\nto the house. David was delighted to find that this house was made of a\r\nreal big black boat, with a door and windows cut in the side, and an\r\niron funnel sticking out of the roof for a chimney. Inside, it was very\r\ncosy and clean, and David had a tiny bedroom in the stern. He was very\r\nmuch pleased to find a dear little girl, about his own age, to play\r\nwith, and soon discovered that she and Ham were orphans, children of Mr.\r\nPeggotty's brother and sister, whose fathers had been drowned at sea, so\r\nkind Mr. Peggotty had taken them to live with him. David was very happy\r\nin this queer house, playing on the beach with Em'ly, as they called the\r\nlittle girl, and told her all about his happy home; and she told him how\r\nher father had been drowned at sea before she came to live with her\r\nuncle. David said he thought Mr. Peggotty must be a very good man.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" said Em'ly. \"If ever I was to be a lady, I'd give him a sky-blue\r\ncoat with diamond buttons, nankeen trousers, a red velvet waistcoat, a\r\ncocked hat, a large gold watch, a silver pipe, and a box of money!\"\r\n\r\nDavid was quite sorry to leave these kind people and his dear little\r\ncompanion, but still he was glad to think he should get back to his own\r\ndear mamma. When he reached home, however, he found a great change. His\r\nmother was married to the dark man David did not like, whose name was\r\nMr. Murdstone, and he was a stern, hard man, who had no love for little\r\nDavid, and did not allow his mother to pet and indulge him as she had\r\ndone before. Mr. Murdstone's sister came to live with them, and as she\r\nwas even more difficult to please than her brother, and disliked boys,\r\nDavid's life was no longer a happy one. He had always had lessons with\r\nhis mother, and as she was patient and gentle, he had enjoyed learning\r\nto read, but now he had a great many very hard lessons to do, and was so\r\nfrightened and shy when Mr. and Miss Murdstone were in the room, that he\r\ndid not get on at all well, and was continually in disgrace. His only\r\npleasure was to go up into the little room at the top of the house\r\nwhere he had found a number of books that had belonged to his own\r\nfather, and he would sit and read Robinson Crusoe, and many tales of\r\ntravels and adventures.\r\n\r\nBut one day he got into sad trouble over his lessons, and Mr. Murdstone\r\nwas very angry, and took him away from his mother and beat him with a\r\ncane. David had never been beaten in his life before, and was so\r\nmaddened by pain and rage that he bit Mr. Murdstone's hand! Now, indeed,\r\nhe had done something to deserve the punishment, and Mr. Murdstone in a\r\nfury, beat him savagely, and left him sobbing and crying on the floor.\r\nDavid was kept locked up in his room for some days, seeing no one but\r\nMiss Murdstone, who brought him his food. At last, one night, he heard\r\nhis name whispered at the key hole.\r\n\r\n\"Is that you, Peggotty?\" he asked, groping his way to the door.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my precious Davy. Be as soft as a mouse or the cat will hear us.\"\r\n\r\nDavid understood she meant Miss Murdstone, whose room was quite near.\r\n\"How's mamma, Peggotty dear? Is she very angry with me?\" he whispered.\r\n\r\n\"No--not very,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"What is going to be done with me, dear Peggotty, do you know?\" asked\r\npoor David, who had been wondering all these long, lonely days.\r\n\r\n\"School--near London--\"\r\n\r\n\"When, Peggotty?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow,\" answered Peggotty.\r\n\r\n\"Shan't I see mamma?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--morning,\" she said, and went on to promise David she would always\r\nlove him, and take the greatest care of his dear mamma, and write him\r\nevery week.\r\n\r\nThe next morning David saw his mother, very pale and with red eyes. He\r\nran to her arms and begged her to forgive him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Davy,\" she said, \"that you should hurt anyone I love! I forgive\r\nyou, Davy, but it grieves me so that you should have such bad passions\r\nin your heart. Try to be better, pray to be better.\"\r\n\r\nDavid was very unhappy that his mother should think him so wicked, and\r\nthough she kissed him, and said, \"I forgive you, my dear boy, God bless\r\nyou,\" he cried so bitterly when he was on his way in the carrier's\r\ncart, that his pocket handkerchief had to be spread out on the horse's\r\nback to dry.\r\n\r\nAfter they had gone a little way the cart stopped, and Peggotty came\r\nrunning up, with a parcel of cakes and a purse for David. After giving\r\nhim a good hug, she ran off.\r\n\r\nDavy found three bright shillings in the purse, and two half-crowns\r\nwrapped in paper on which was written, in his mother's hand--\"For Davy.\r\nWith my love.\"\r\n\r\nDavy shared his cakes with the carrier, who asked if Peggotty made them,\r\nand David told him yes, she did all their cooking. The carrier looked\r\nthoughtful, and then asked David if he would send a message to Peggotty\r\nfrom him. David agreed, and the message was \"Barkis is willing.\" While\r\nDavid was waiting for the coach at Yarmouth, he wrote to Peggotty:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR PEGGOTTY,--I have come here safe. Barkis is willing. My love to\r\nmamma.--Yours affectionately.\"\r\n\r\n\"_P. S._--He says he particularly wanted you to know _Barkis is\r\nwilling_.\"\r\n\r\nAt Yarmouth he found dinner was ordered for him, and felt very shy at\r\nhaving a table all to himself, and very much alarmed when the waiter\r\ntold him he had seen a gentleman fall down dead, after drinking some of\r\ntheir beer. David said he would have some water, and was quite grateful\r\nto the waiter for drinking the ale that had been ordered for him, for\r\nfear the people of the hotel should be offended. He also helped David to\r\neat his dinner and accepted one of his bright shillings.\r\n\r\nWhen they got to Salem House, as the School was called, David found that\r\nhe had been sent before the holidays were over as a punishment, and was\r\nalso to wear a placard on his back, on which was written--\"Take care of\r\nhim. He bites.\" This made David miserable, and he dreaded the return of\r\nthe boys.\r\n\r\nSome of the boys teased David by pretending he was a dog, calling him\r\nTowser, and patting and stroking him; but, on the whole, it was not so\r\nbad as David had expected. The head boy, Steerforth, promised to take\r\ncare of him, and David loved him dearly, and thought him a great hero.\r\nSteerforth took a great fancy to the pretty bright-eyed little fellow,\r\nand David became a favorite with all the boys, by telling them all he\r\ncould remember of the tales he had read.\r\n\r\nOne day David had a visit from Mr. Peggotty and Ham, who had brought two\r\nenormous lobsters, a huge crab, and a large canvas bag of shrimps, as\r\nthey \"remembered he was partial to a relish with his meals.\"\r\n\r\nDavid was proud to introduce his friend Steerforth to these kind simple\r\nfriends, and told them how good Steerforth was to him, and the \"relish\"\r\nwas much appreciated by the boys at supper that night.\r\n\r\nWhen he got home for the holidays David found he had a little baby\r\nbrother, and his mother and Peggotty were very much pleased to see him\r\nagain. Mr. and Miss Murdstone were out, and David sat with his mother\r\nand Peggotty, and told them all about his school and Steerforth, and\r\ntook the little baby in his arms and nursed it lovingly. But when the\r\nMurdstones came back they showed plainly they disliked him, and thought\r\nhim in the way, and scolded him, and would not allow him to touch the\r\nbaby, or even to sit with Peggotty in the kitchen, so he was not sorry\r\nwhen the time came for him to go back to school, except for leaving his\r\ndear mamma and the baby.\r\n\r\nAbout two months after he had been back at school he was sent for one\r\nday and told that his dear mamma had died! The wife of the head-master\r\nwas very kind and gentle to the desolate little boy, and the boys were\r\nvery sorry for him.\r\n\r\nDavid went home the next day, and heard that the dear baby had died too.\r\nPeggotty received him with great tenderness, and told him about his\r\nmother's illness and how she had sent a loving message.\r\n\r\n\"Tell my dearest boy that his mother, as she lay here, blessed him not\r\nonce, but a thousand times,\" and she had prayed to God to protect and\r\nkeep her fatherless boy.\r\n\r\nMr. Murdstone did not take any notice of poor little David, nor had Miss\r\nMurdstone a word of kindness for the orphan. Peggotty was to leave in a\r\nmonth, and, to their great joy, David was allowed to go with her on a\r\nvisit to Mr. Peggotty. On their way David found out that the mysterious\r\nmessage he had given to Peggotty meant that Barkis wanted to marry her,\r\nand Peggotty had consented. Everyone in Mr. Peggotty's cottage was\r\npleased to see David, and did their best to comfort him. Little Em'ly\r\nwas at school when he arrived, and he went out to meet her, but when he\r\nsaw her coming along, her blue eyes bluer, and her bright face prettier\r\nthan ever, he pretended not to know her, and was passing by, when Em'ly\r\nlaughed and ran away, so of course he was obliged to run and catch her\r\nand try to kiss her, but she would not let him, saying she was not a\r\nbaby now. But she was kind to him all the same, and when they spoke\r\nabout the loss of his dear mother, David saw that her eyes were full of\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nDuring this visit Peggotty was married to Mr. Barkis, and had a nice\r\nlittle house of her own, and Davy spent the night before he was to\r\nreturn home in a little room in the roof.\r\n\r\n\"Young or old, Davy dear, so long as I have this house over my head,\"\r\nsaid Peggotty, \"you shall find it as if I expected you here directly\r\nevery minute. I shall keep it as I used to keep your old little room, my\r\ndarling, and if you was to go to China, you might think of its being\r\nkept just the same all the time you were away.\"\r\n\r\nDavid felt how good and true a friend she was, and thanked her as well\r\nas he could, for they had brought him to the gate of his home, and\r\nPeggotty had him clasped in her arms.\r\n\r\nHow utterly wretched and forlorn he felt! He found he was not to go back\r\nto school any more, and wandered about sad and solitary, neglected and\r\nuncared for. Peggotty's weekly visits were his only comfort. No one took\r\nany pains with him, and he had no friends near who could help him.\r\n\r\nAt last one day, after some weary months had passed, Mr. Murdstone told\r\nhim he was to go to London and earn his own living. There was a place\r\nfor him at Murdstone & Grinby's, a firm in the wine trade. His lodging\r\nand clothes would be provided for him by his step-father, and he would\r\nearn enough for his food and pocket money. The next day David was sent\r\nup to London with the manager, dressed in a shabby little white hat with\r\nblack crape round it for his mother, a black jacket, and hard, stiff\r\ncorduroy trousers, a little fellow of ten years old to fight his own\r\nbattles in the world!\r\n\r\nHis place, he found, was one of the lowest, with boys of no education\r\nand in quite an inferior station to himself--his duties were to wash\r\nbottles, stick on labels, and so on. David was utterly miserable at\r\nbeing degraded in this way, and shed bitter tears, as he feared he would\r\nforget all he had learnt at school. His lodging, one bare little room,\r\nwas in the house of some people named Micawber, shiftless, careless,\r\ngood-natured people, who were always in debt and difficulties. David\r\nfelt great pity for their misfortunes and did what he could to help poor\r\nMrs. Micawber to sell her books and other little things she could spare,\r\nto buy food for herself, her husband, and their four children. If he had\r\nnot been a very innocent-minded, good little boy, he might easily have\r\nfallen into bad ways at this time. But God took care of the orphan boy\r\nand kept him from harm.\r\n\r\nThe troubles of the Micawbers increased more and more, until at last\r\nthey were obliged to leave London. The last Sunday the Micawbers were in\r\ntown David dined with them. After he had seen them off the next morning\r\nby the coach, he wrote to Peggotty to ask her if she knew where his\r\naunt, Miss Betsy Trotwood, lived, and to borrow half a guinea; for he\r\nhad resolved to run away from Murdstone & Grinby's, and go to his aunt\r\nand tell her his story. Peggotty wrote, enclosing the half-guinea, and\r\nsaying she only knew Miss Trotwood lived near Dover, but whether in that\r\nplace itself, or at Folkestone, Sandgate, or Hythe, she could not tell.\r\nHearing that all these places were close together, David made up his\r\nmind to start. As he had received his week's wages in advance, he waited\r\ntill the following Saturday, thinking it would not be honest to go\r\nbefore. He went out to look for some one to carry his box to the coach\r\noffice, and unfortunately employed a wicked young man who not only ran\r\noff with his box, but robbed him of his half-guinea, leaving poor David\r\nin dire distress. In despair, he started off to walk to Dover, and was\r\nforced to sell his waistcoat to buy some bread. The first night he found\r\nhis way to his old school at Blackheath, and slept on a haystack close\r\nby, feeling some comfort in the thought of the boys being near. He knew\r\nSteerforth had left, or he would have tried to see him.\r\n\r\nOn he trudged the next day and sold his jacket for one shilling and\r\nfourpence. He was afraid to buy anything but bread or to spend any money\r\non a bed or a shelter for the night. After six days, he arrived at\r\nDover, ragged, dusty, and half-dead with hunger and fatigue. But here,\r\nat first, he could get no tidings of his aunt, and, in despair, was\r\ngoing to try some of the other places Peggotty had mentioned, when the\r\ndriver of a fly dropped his horsecloth, and as David was handing it up\r\nto him, he saw something kind in the man's face that encouraged him to\r\nask once more if he knew where Miss Trotwood lived.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LITTLE DAVID COPPERFIELD.]\r\n\r\nThe man directed him towards some houses on the heights, and thither\r\nDavid toiled; a forlorn little creature, without a jacket or waistcoat,\r\nhis white hat crushed out of shape, his shoes worn out, his shirt and\r\ntrousers torn and stained, his pretty curly hair tangled, his face and\r\nhands sunburnt, and covered with dust. Lifting his big, wistful eyes to\r\none of the windows above, he saw a pleasant faced gentleman with grey\r\nhair, who nodded at him several times, then shook his head and went\r\naway. David was just turning away to think what he should do, when a\r\ntall, erect, elderly lady, with a gardening apron on and a knife in her\r\nhand, came out of the house, and began to dig up a root in the garden.\r\n\r\n\"Go away,\" she cried. \"Go away. No boys here.\"\r\n\r\nBut David felt desperate. Going in softly, he stood beside her, and\r\ntouched her with his finger, and said timidly, \"If you please, ma'am--\"\r\nand when she looked up, he went on--\r\n\r\n\"Please, aunt, I am your nephew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Lord!\" she exclaimed in astonishment, and sat flat down on the\r\npath, staring at him, while he went on--\r\n\r\n\"I am David Copperfield, of Blunderstone, in Suffolk, where you came the\r\nnight I was born, and saw my dear mamma. I have been unhappy since she\r\ndied. I have been slighted and taught nothing, and thrown upon myself,\r\nand put to work not fit for me. It made me run away to you. I was robbed\r\nat first starting out and have walked all the way, and have never slept\r\nin a bed since I began the journey.\" Here he broke into a passion of\r\ncrying, and his aunt jumped up and took him into the house, where she\r\nput him on the sofa and sent the servant to ask \"Mr. Dick\" to come down.\r\nThe gentleman whom David had seen at the window came in and was told who\r\nthe ragged little object on the sofa was.\r\n\r\n\"Now here you see young David Copperfield, and the question is What\r\nshall I do with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do with him?\" answered Mr. Dick. Then, after some consideration, and\r\nlooking at David, he said, \"Well, if I was you, I would wash him!\"\r\n\r\nDavid knelt down to say his prayers that night in a pleasant room facing\r\nthe sea, and as he lay in the clean, snow-white bed, he prayed he might\r\nnever be homeless again, and might never forget the homeless.\r\n\r\nThe next morning his aunt told him she had written to Mr. Murdstone, and\r\nat last Mr. and Miss Murdstone arrived.\r\n\r\nMr. Murdstone told Miss Betsy that David was a very bad, stubborn,\r\nviolent-tempered boy, whom he had tried to improve, but could not\r\nsucceed. If Miss Trotwood chose to protect and encourage him now, she\r\nmust do it always, for he had come to fetch him away.\r\n\r\n\"Are you ready to go, David?\" asked his aunt.\r\n\r\nBut David answered no, and begged and prayed her for his father's sake\r\nto befriend and protect him, for neither Mr. nor Miss Murdstone had ever\r\nliked him or been kind to him.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dick,\" said Miss Trotwood, \"what shall I do with this child?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dick considered. \"Have him measured for a suit of clothes directly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dick,\" said Miss Trotwood, \"your common sense is invaluable.\"\r\n\r\nThen she pulled David towards her, and said to Mr. Murdstone, \"You can\r\ngo when you like. I'll take my chance with the boy. If he's all you say\r\nhe is I can at least do as much for him as you have done. But I don't\r\nbelieve a word of it.\"\r\n\r\nSome clothes were bought for him that same day and marked \"Trotwood\r\nCopperfield,\" for his aunt wished to call him by her name.\r\n\r\nNow David felt his troubles were over, and he began quite a new life,\r\nwell cared for and kindly treated. He was sent to a very nice school in\r\nCanterbury, where his aunt left him with these words, which David never\r\nforgot.\r\n\r\n\"Trot, be a credit to yourself, to me, and Mr. Dick, and Heaven be with\r\nyou. Never be mean in anything, never be false, never be cruel. Avoid\r\nthese three vices, Trot, and I shall always be hopeful of you.\"\r\n\r\nDavid did his best to show his gratitude to his dear aunt by studying\r\nhard, and trying to be all she could wish.\r\n\r\nWhen you are older you can read how he grew up to be a good, clever man,\r\nand met again all his old friends, and made many new ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJENNY WREN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, a great many years ago, a gentleman ran up the steps of a tall\r\nhouse in the neighborhood of St. Mary Axe.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman knocked and rang several times before any one came, but at\r\nlast an old man opened the door. \"What were you up to that you did not\r\nhear me?\" said Mr. Fledgeby irritably.\r\n\r\n\"I was taking the air at the top of the house, sir,\" said the old man\r\nmeekly, \"it being a holiday. What might you please to want, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph! Holiday indeed,\" grumbled his master, who was a toy merchant\r\namongst other things. He then seated himself and gave the old man--a Jew\r\nand Riah by name--directions about the dressing of some dolls, and, as\r\nhe rose to go, exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"By the bye, how _do_ you take the air? Do you stick your head out of a\r\nchimney-pot?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I have made a little garden on the roof.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's look at it,\" said Mr. Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I have company there,\" returned Riah hesitating, \"but will you\r\nplease come up and see them?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fledgeby nodded, and the old man led the way up flight after flight\r\nof stairs, till they arrived at the house-top. Seated on a carpet, and\r\nleaning against a chimney-stack, were two girls bending over books. Some\r\ncreepers were trained round the chimney-pots, and evergreens were placed\r\nround the roof, and a few more books, a basket of gaily colored scraps,\r\nand bits of tinsel, lay near. One of the girls rose on seeing that Riah\r\nhad brought a visitor, but the other remarked, \"I'm the person of the\r\nhouse downstairs, but I can't get up, whoever you are, because my back\r\nis bad, and my legs are queer.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is my master,\" said Riah speaking to the two girls, \"and this,\" he\r\nadded, turning to Mr. Fledgeby, \"is Miss Jenny Wren; she lives in this\r\nhouse, and is a clever little dressmaker for little people. Her friend\r\nLizzie,\" continued Riah, introducing the second girl. \"They are good\r\ngirls, both, and as busy as they are good; in spare moments they come up\r\nhere, and take to book learning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" said Mr. Fledgeby, looking round, \"Humph!\" He was so much\r\nsurprised that apparently he couldn't get beyond that word.\r\n\r\nLizzie, the elder of these two girls, was strong and handsome, but the\r\nlittle Jenny Wren, whom she so loved and protected, was small, and\r\ndeformed, though she had a beautiful little face, and the longest and\r\nloveliest golden hair in the world, which fell about her like a cloak of\r\nshining curls, as though to hide the poor little misshapen figure.\r\n\r\nThe Jew Riah, as well as Lizzie, was always kind and gentle to Jenny\r\nWren, who called him godfather. She had a father, who shared her poor\r\nlittle rooms, whom she called her child, for he was a bad, drunken,\r\ndisreputable old man, and the poor girl had to care for him, and earn\r\nmoney to keep them both. Sometimes the two girls, Jenny helping herself\r\nalong with a crutch, would go and walk about the fashionable streets. As\r\nthey walked along, Jenny would tell her friend of the fancies she had\r\nwhen sitting alone at her work. \"I imagine birds till I can hear them\r\nsing,\" she said one day, \"and flowers till I can smell them. And oh! the\r\nbeautiful children that come to me, in the early mornings! They are\r\nquite different to other children, not like me, never cold, or anxious,\r\nor tired, or hungry, never any pain; they come in numbers, in long\r\nbright slanting rows, all dressed in white, with shiny heads. 'Who is\r\nthis in pain?' they say, and they sweep around and about me, take me up\r\nin their arms, and I feel so light, and all the pain goes. I know they\r\nare coming a long way off, by hearing them say, 'Who is this in pain?'\r\nand I answer, 'Oh my blessed children, it's poor me! have pity on me,\r\nand take me up and then the pain will go.'\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: JENNIE WREN.\r\n  \"THE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN THAT COME TO ME.\"]\r\n\r\nLizzie sat stroking and brushing the beautiful hair, when they were at\r\nhome again, and as she kissed her good-night, a miserable old man\r\nstumbled into the room. \"How's my Jenny Wren, best of children?\" he\r\nmumbled, as he shuffled unsteadily towards her, but Jenny pointed her\r\nsmall finger towards him exclaiming--\"Go along with you, you bad,\r\nwicked, old child, you troublesome, wicked, old thing, _I_ know where\r\nyou have been; ain't you ashamed of yourself, you disgraceful boy?\"\r\n\"Yes; my dear, yes,\" stammered the tipsy old father, tumbling into a\r\ncorner. One day when Jenny was on her way home with Riah, they came on a\r\nsmall crowd of people. A tipsy man had been knocked down and badly\r\nhurt--\"Let us see what it is!\" said Jennie. The next moment she\r\nexclaimed--\"Oh, gentlemen--gentlemen, he is my child, he belongs to me,\r\nmy poor, bad, old child!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your child--belongs to you--\" repeated the man who was about to lift\r\nthe helpless figure on to a stretcher. \"Aye, it's old Dolls--tipsy old\r\nDolls--\" cried some one in the crowd, for it was by this name that they\r\nknew the old man.\r\n\r\n\"He's her father, sir,\" said Riah in a low tone to the doctor who was\r\nnow bending over the stretcher.\r\n\r\n\"So much the worse,\" answered the doctor, \"for the man is dead.\"\r\n\r\nYes, \"Mr. Dolls\" was dead, and many were the dresses which the weary\r\nfingers of the sorrowful little worker must make in order to pay for his\r\nhumble funeral, and buy a black frock for herself. Often the tears\r\nrolled down on to her work. \"My poor child,\" she said to Riah, \"my poor\r\nold child, and to think I scolded him so.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were always a good, brave, patient girl,\" returned Riah, \"always\r\ngood and patient, however tired.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so the poor little \"person of the house\" was left alone but for the\r\nfaithful affection of the kind Jew, and her friend Lizzie. Her room grew\r\npretty comfortable, for she was in great request in her \"profession\" as\r\nshe called it, and there was now no one to spend and waste her earnings.\r\nBut nothing could make her life otherwise than a suffering one till the\r\nhappy morning, when her child-angels visited her for the last time and\r\ncarried her away to the land where all such pain as hers is healed for\r\nevermore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIP'S ADVENTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that little Philip Pirrip, usually called Pip, knew about his father\r\nand mother, and five little brothers, was from seeing their tombstones\r\nin the churchyard. He was taken care of by his sister, who was twenty\r\nyears older than himself. She had married a blacksmith, named Joe\r\nGargery, a kind, good man, while she, unfortunately, was a hard, stern\r\nwoman, and treated her little brother and her amiable husband with great\r\nharshness. They lived in a marshy part of the country, about twenty\r\nmiles from the sea.\r\n\r\nOne cold raw day towards evening, when Pip was about six years old, he\r\nwandered into the churchyard, and trying to make out what he could of\r\nthe inscriptions on his family tombstones, and the darkness coming on,\r\nhe felt very lonely and frightened, and began to cry.\r\n\r\n\"Hold your noise!\" cried a terrible voice, and a man started up from\r\namong the graves close to him. \"Keep still, you little imp, or I'll cut\r\nyour throat!\"\r\n\r\nHe was a dreadful looking man, dressed in coarse grey cloth, with a\r\ngreat iron on his leg. Wet, muddy and miserable, his teeth chattered in\r\nhis head, as he seized Pip by the chin.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! don't cut my throat, sir,\" cried Pip, in terror.\r\n\r\n\"Tell us your name!\" said the man. \"Quick!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pip, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Once more,\" said the man, staring at him. \"Give it mouth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pip. Pip, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Show us where you live,\" said the man. \"Point out the place.\"\r\n\r\nPip showed him the village, about a mile or more from the church.\r\n\r\nThe man looked at him for a moment, and then turned him upside down and\r\nemptied his pockets. He found nothing in them but a piece of bread,\r\nwhich he ate ravenously.\r\n\r\n\"Now lookee here,\" said the man. \"Where's your mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"There, sir,\" said Pip.\r\n\r\nAt this the man started to run away, but stopped and looked over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"There, sir,\" explained Pip, showing him the tombstone.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, and is that your father along of your mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Pip.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" muttered the man, \"then who d'ye live with--supposin' you're\r\nkindly let to live, which I han't made up my mind about?\"\r\n\r\n\"My sister, sir, Mrs. Joe Gargery, wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blacksmith, eh?\" said the man, and looked down at his leg. Then he\r\nseized the trembling little boy by both arms, and glaring down at him,\r\nhe said,--\r\n\r\n\"Now lookee here, the question being whether you're to be let to\r\nlive--You know what a file is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you know what wittles is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You get me a file, and you get me wittles--you bring 'em both to me.\"\r\nAll this time he was tilting poor Pip backwards till he was dreadfully\r\nfrightened and giddy.\r\n\r\n\"You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles--You\r\ndo it, and you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign\r\nconcerning your having seen such a person as me, or any person sumever,\r\nand you shall be let to live.\" Then he let him go, saying--\"You remember\r\nwhat you've undertook, and you get home.\"\r\n\r\nPip ran home without stopping. Joe was sitting in the chimney corner,\r\nand told him Mrs. Joe had been out to look for him, and taken Tickler\r\nwith her. Tickler was a cane, and Pip was rather depressed by this piece\r\nof news.\r\n\r\nMrs. Joe came in almost directly, and after having given Pip a taste of\r\nTickler, she sat down to prepare the tea, and cutting a huge slice of\r\nbread and butter, she gave half of it to Joe and half to Pip. Pip\r\nmanaged, after some time, to slip his down the leg of his trousers, and\r\nJoe, thinking he had swallowed it, was dreadfully alarmed and begged him\r\nnot to bolt his food like that. \"Pip, old chap, you'll do yourself a\r\nmischief,--it'll stick somewhere, you can't have chewed it, Pip. You\r\nknow, Pip, you and me is always friends, and I'd be the last to tell\r\nupon you at any time, but such a--such a most uncommon bolt as that.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PIP AND THE CONVICT.\r\n  HALF DEAD WITH COLD AND HUNGER.]\r\n\r\n\"Been bolting his food, has he?\" cried Mrs. Joe.\r\n\r\n\"You know, old chap,\" said Joe, \"I bolted myself when I was your\r\nage--frequent--and as a boy I've been among many bolters; but I never\r\nsee your bolting equal yet, Pip, and it's a mercy you ain't bolted\r\ndead.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Pip passed a wretched night, thinking of the dreadful promise he\r\nhad made, and as soon as it was beginning to get light outside he got up\r\nand crept downstairs.\r\n\r\nAs quickly as he could he took some bread, some cheese, about half a jar\r\nof mince-meat he tied up in a handkerchief, with the slice of bread and\r\nbutter, some brandy from a stone bottle, a meat bone with very little on\r\nit, and a pork pie, which he found on an upper shelf. Then he got a file\r\nfrom among Joe's tools, and ran for the marshes.\r\n\r\nPip found the man waiting for him, half dead with cold and hunger, and\r\nhe ate the food in such a ravenous way that Pip, in spite of his terror,\r\nwas quite pitiful over him, and said, \"I am glad you enjoy it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thankee, my boy, I do.\"\r\n\r\nPip watched him trying to file the iron off his leg, and then, being\r\nafraid of stopping longer away from home, he ran off.\r\n\r\nPip passed a wretched morning expecting every moment that the\r\ndisappearance of the pie would be found out. But Mrs. Joe was too much\r\ntaken up with preparing the dinner, for they were expecting visitors.\r\n\r\nJust at the end of the dinner Pip thought his time had come to be found\r\nout, for his sister said graciously to her guests--\r\n\r\n\"You must taste a most delightful and delicious present I have had. It's\r\na pie, a savory pork pie.\"\r\n\r\nPip could bear it no longer, and ran for the door, and there ran head\r\nforemost into a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held\r\nout a pair of handcuffs to him saying--\"Here you are, look sharp, come\r\non.\" But they had not come for him, they only wanted Joe to mend the\r\nhandcuffs, for they were on the search for two convicts who had escaped\r\nand were somewhere hid in the marshes. This turned the attention of Mrs.\r\nJoe from the disappearance of the pie without which she had come back,\r\nin great astonishment. When the handcuffs were mended the soldiers went\r\noff, accompanied by Joe and one of the visitors, and Joe took Pip and\r\ncarried him on his back.\r\n\r\nPip whispered, \"I hope, Joe, we shan't find them,\" and Joe answered \"I'd\r\ngive a shilling if they had cut and run, Pip.\"\r\n\r\nBut the soldiers soon caught them, and one was Pip's miserable\r\nacquaintance, and once when the man looked at Pip, the child shook his\r\nhead to try and let him know he had said nothing.\r\n\r\nBut the convict, without looking at anyone, told the Sergeant he wanted\r\nto say something to prevent other people being under suspicion, and said\r\nhe had taken some \"wittles\" from the blacksmith's. \"It was some broken\r\nwittles, that's what it was, and a dram of liquor, and a pie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?\"\r\nenquired the Sergeant.\r\n\r\n\"My wife did, at the very moment when you came in.\"\r\n\r\n\"So,\" said the convict, looking at Joe, \"you're the blacksmith, are you?\r\nThen I'm sorry to say, I've eat your pie.\"\r\n\r\n\"God knows you're welcome to it,\" said Joe. \"We don't know what you have\r\ndone, but we wouldn't have you starved to death for it, poor miserable\r\nfellow creature. Would us, Pip?\"\r\n\r\nThen the boat came, and the convicts were taken back to prison, and Joe\r\ncarried Pip home.\r\n\r\nSome years after, some mysterious friend sent money for Pip to be\r\neducated and brought up as a gentleman, but it was only when Pip was\r\nquite grown up that he discovered this mysterious friend was the\r\nwretched convict who had frightened him so dreadfully that cold, dark\r\nChristmas Eve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Text in italics is indicated with underscores: _italics_.\r\n\r\n  Inconsistencies in spelling and hyphenation have been retained from\r\n    the original.\r\n\r\n  Punctuation has been corrected without note.\r\n\r\n  Obvious typographical errors have been corrected as follows:\r\n    Page  7: Fren changed to Fern\r\n    Page 25: Joe changed to Jo\r\n    Page 31: DORRITT changed to DORRIT\r\n    Page 34: needlwork changed to needlework\r\n    Page 40: distresed changed to distressed\r\n    Page 41: grandfaather changed to grandfather\r\n    Page 56: hugh changed to huge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Charles Dickens' Children Stories, by \r\nCharles Dickens\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CHARLES DICKENS' CHILDREN STORIES ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 37121.txt or 37121.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/3/7/1/2/37121/\r\n\r\nProduced by Juliet Sutherland, David E.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n",
    "\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProduced by Jose Menendez\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHRISTMAS CAROL\r\n\r\nIN PROSE\r\nBEING\r\nA Ghost Story of Christmas\r\n\r\nby Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nI HAVE endeavoured in this Ghostly little book,\r\nto raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my\r\nreaders out of humour with themselves, with each other,\r\nwith the season, or with me.  May it haunt their houses\r\npleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.\r\n\r\nTheir faithful Friend and Servant,\r\n                                   C. D.\r\nDecember, 1843.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nStave   I: Marley's Ghost\r\nStave  II: The First of the Three Spirits\r\nStave III: The Second of the Three Spirits\r\nStave  IV: The Last of the Spirits\r\nStave   V: The End of It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAVE I:  MARLEY'S GHOST\r\n\r\nMARLEY was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt\r\nwhatever about that. The register of his burial was\r\nsigned by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,\r\nand the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and\r\nScrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he\r\nchose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a\r\ndoor-nail.\r\n\r\nMind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my\r\nown knowledge, what there is particularly dead about\r\na door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to\r\nregard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery\r\nin the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors\r\nis in the simile; and my unhallowed hands\r\nshall not disturb it, or the Country's done for. You\r\nwill therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that\r\nMarley was as dead as a door-nail.\r\n\r\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did.\r\nHow could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were\r\npartners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge\r\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole\r\nassign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and\r\nsole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully\r\ncut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent\r\nman of business on the very day of the funeral,\r\nand solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.\r\n\r\nThe mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to\r\nthe point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley\r\nwas dead. This must be distinctly understood, or\r\nnothing wonderful can come of the story I am going\r\nto relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that\r\nHamlet's Father died before the play began, there\r\nwould be nothing more remarkable in his taking a\r\nstroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\r\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged\r\ngentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy\r\nspot--say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance--\r\nliterally to astonish his son's weak mind.\r\n\r\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley's name.\r\nThere it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse\r\ndoor: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as\r\nScrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the\r\nbusiness called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley,\r\nbut he answered to both names. It was all the\r\nsame to him.\r\n\r\nOh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone,\r\nScrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping,\r\nclutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint,\r\nfrom which no steel had ever struck out generous fire;\r\nsecret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The\r\ncold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed\r\nnose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his\r\neyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his\r\ngrating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his\r\neyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low\r\ntemperature always about with him; he iced his office in\r\nthe dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.\r\n\r\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on\r\nScrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather\r\nchill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he,\r\nno falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no\r\npelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't\r\nknow where to have him. The heaviest rain, and\r\nsnow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage\r\nover him in only one respect. They often \"came down\"\r\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\r\n\r\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with\r\ngladsome looks, \"My dear Scrooge, how are you?\r\nWhen will you come to see me?\" No beggars implored\r\nhim to bestow a trifle, no children asked him\r\nwhat it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all\r\nhis life inquired the way to such and such a place, of\r\nScrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to\r\nknow him; and when they saw him coming on, would\r\ntug their owners into doorways and up courts; and\r\nthen would wag their tails as though they said, \"No\r\neye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\"\r\n\r\nBut what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing\r\nhe liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths\r\nof life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance,\r\nwas what the knowing ones call \"nuts\" to Scrooge.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year,\r\non Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his\r\ncounting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy\r\nwithal: and he could hear the people in the court outside,\r\ngo wheezing up and down, beating their hands\r\nupon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the\r\npavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had\r\nonly just gone three, but it was quite dark already--\r\nit had not been light all day--and candles were flaring\r\nin the windows of the neighbouring offices, like\r\nruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog\r\ncame pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was\r\nso dense without, that although the court was of the\r\nnarrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms.\r\nTo see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring\r\neverything, one might have thought that Nature\r\nlived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.\r\n\r\nThe door of Scrooge's counting-house was open\r\nthat he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a\r\ndismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying\r\nletters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's\r\nfire was so very much smaller that it looked like one\r\ncoal. But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept\r\nthe coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the\r\nclerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted\r\nthat it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore\r\nthe clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to\r\nwarm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being\r\na man of a strong imagination, he failed.\r\n\r\n\"A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\" cried\r\na cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge's\r\nnephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was\r\nthe first intimation he had of his approach.\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" said Scrooge, \"Humbug!\"\r\n\r\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the\r\nfog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's, that he was\r\nall in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his\r\neyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\r\n\r\n\"Christmas a humbug, uncle!\" said Scrooge's\r\nnephew. \"You don't mean that, I am sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"Merry Christmas! What\r\nright have you to be merry? What reason have you\r\nto be merry? You're poor enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, then,\" returned the nephew gaily. \"What\r\nright have you to be dismal? What reason have you\r\nto be morose? You're rich enough.\"\r\n\r\nScrooge having no better answer ready on the spur\r\nof the moment, said, \"Bah!\" again; and followed it up\r\nwith \"Humbug.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be cross, uncle!\" said the nephew.\r\n\r\n\"What else can I be,\" returned the uncle, \"when I\r\nlive in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas!\r\nOut upon merry Christmas! What's Christmas\r\ntime to you but a time for paying bills without\r\nmoney; a time for finding yourself a year older, but\r\nnot an hour richer; a time for balancing your books\r\nand having every item in 'em through a round dozen\r\nof months presented dead against you? If I could\r\nwork my will,\" said Scrooge indignantly, \"every idiot\r\nwho goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips,\r\nshould be boiled with his own pudding, and buried\r\nwith a stake of holly through his heart. He should!\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle!\" pleaded the nephew.\r\n\r\n\"Nephew!\" returned the uncle sternly, \"keep Christmas\r\nin your own way, and let me keep it in mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep it!\" repeated Scrooge's nephew. \"But you\r\ndon't keep it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me leave it alone, then,\" said Scrooge. \"Much\r\ngood may it do you! Much good it has ever done\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\n\"There are many things from which I might have\r\nderived good, by which I have not profited, I dare\r\nsay,\" returned the nephew. \"Christmas among the\r\nrest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas\r\ntime, when it has come round--apart from the\r\nveneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything\r\nbelonging to it can be apart from that--as a\r\ngood time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant\r\ntime; the only time I know of, in the long calendar\r\nof the year, when men and women seem by one consent\r\nto open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think\r\nof people below them as if they really were\r\nfellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race\r\nof creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\r\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or\r\nsilver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me\r\ngood, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded.\r\nBecoming immediately sensible of the impropriety,\r\nhe poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\n\"Let me hear another sound from you,\" said\r\nScrooge, \"and you'll keep your Christmas by losing\r\nyour situation! You're quite a powerful speaker,\r\nsir,\" he added, turning to his nephew. \"I wonder you\r\ndon't go into Parliament.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nScrooge said that he would see him--yes, indeed he\r\ndid. He went the whole length of the expression,\r\nand said that he would see him in that extremity first.\r\n\r\n\"But why?\" cried Scrooge's nephew. \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you get married?\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Because I fell in love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you fell in love!\" growled Scrooge, as if\r\nthat were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous\r\nthan a merry Christmas. \"Good afternoon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before\r\nthat happened. Why give it as a reason for not\r\ncoming now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you;\r\nwhy cannot we be friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so\r\nresolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I\r\nhave been a party. But I have made the trial in\r\nhomage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas\r\nhumour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"And A Happy New Year!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word,\r\nnotwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to\r\nbestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who,\r\ncold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\r\nthem cordially.\r\n\r\n\"There's another fellow,\" muttered Scrooge; who\r\noverheard him: \"my clerk, with fifteen shillings a\r\nweek, and a wife and family, talking about a merry\r\nChristmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.\"\r\n\r\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had\r\nlet two other people in. They were portly gentlemen,\r\npleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off,\r\nin Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in\r\ntheir hands, and bowed to him.\r\n\r\n\"Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,\" said one of the\r\ngentlemen, referring to his list. \"Have I the pleasure\r\nof addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\"\r\nScrooge replied. \"He died seven years ago, this very\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have no doubt his liberality is well represented\r\nby his surviving partner,\" said the gentleman, presenting\r\nhis credentials.\r\n\r\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred\r\nspirits. At the ominous word \"liberality,\" Scrooge\r\nfrowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\"\r\nsaid the gentleman, taking up a pen, \"it is more than\r\nusually desirable that we should make some slight\r\nprovision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer\r\ngreatly at the present time. Many thousands are in\r\nwant of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands\r\nare in want of common comforts, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there no prisons?\" asked Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Plenty of prisons,\" said the gentleman, laying down\r\nthe pen again.\r\n\r\n\"And the Union workhouses?\" demanded Scrooge.\r\n\"Are they still in operation?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are. Still,\" returned the gentleman, \"I wish\r\nI could say they were not.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour,\r\nthen?\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Both very busy, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first,\r\nthat something had occurred to stop them in their\r\nuseful course,\" said Scrooge. \"I'm very glad to\r\nhear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Under the impression that they scarcely furnish\r\nChristian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,\"\r\nreturned the gentleman, \"a few of us are endeavouring\r\nto raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink,\r\nand means of warmth. We choose this time, because\r\nit is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt,\r\nand Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down\r\nfor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing!\" Scrooge replied.\r\n\r\n\"You wish to be anonymous?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish to be left alone,\" said Scrooge. \"Since you\r\nask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer.\r\nI don't make merry myself at Christmas and I can't\r\nafford to make idle people merry. I help to support\r\nthe establishments I have mentioned--they cost\r\nenough; and those who are badly off must go there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Many can't go there; and many would rather die.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they would rather die,\" said Scrooge, \"they had\r\nbetter do it, and decrease the surplus population.\r\nBesides--excuse me--I don't know that.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you might know it,\" observed the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\"It's not my business,\" Scrooge returned. \"It's\r\nenough for a man to understand his own business, and\r\nnot to interfere with other people's. Mine occupies\r\nme constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\"\r\n\r\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue\r\ntheir point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed\r\nhis labours with an improved opinion of himself,\r\nand in a more facetious temper than was usual\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that\r\npeople ran about with flaring links, proffering their\r\nservices to go before horses in carriages, and conduct\r\nthem on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\r\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down\r\nat Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became\r\ninvisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the\r\nclouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if\r\nits teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there.\r\nThe cold became intense. In the main street, at the\r\ncorner of the court, some labourers were repairing\r\nthe gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\r\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were\r\ngathered: warming their hands and winking their\r\neyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\r\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed,\r\nand turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness\r\nof the shops where holly sprigs and berries\r\ncrackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale\r\nfaces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers'\r\ntrades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant,\r\nwith which it was next to impossible to believe that\r\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything\r\nto do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the\r\nmighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks\r\nand butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's\r\nhousehold should; and even the little tailor, whom he\r\nhad fined five shillings on the previous Monday for\r\nbeing drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up\r\nto-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean\r\nwife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.\r\n\r\nFoggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting\r\ncold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped\r\nthe Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such weather\r\nas that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then\r\nindeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The\r\nowner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled\r\nby the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\r\nstooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with\r\na Christmas carol: but at the first sound of\r\n\r\n        \"God bless you, merry gentleman!\r\n         May nothing you dismay!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action,\r\nthat the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to\r\nthe fog and even more congenial frost.\r\n\r\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house\r\narrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his\r\nstool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant\r\nclerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out,\r\nand put on his hat.\r\n\r\n\"You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\" said\r\nScrooge.\r\n\r\n\"If quite convenient, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not convenient,\" said Scrooge, \"and it's not\r\nfair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you'd\r\nthink yourself ill-used, I'll be bound?\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" said Scrooge, \"you don't think me ill-used,\r\nwhen I pay a day's wages for no work.\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\r\n\r\n\"A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every\r\ntwenty-fifth of December!\" said Scrooge, buttoning\r\nhis great-coat to the chin. \"But I suppose you must\r\nhave the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge\r\nwalked out with a growl. The office was closed in a\r\ntwinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his\r\nwhite comforter dangling below his waist (for he\r\nboasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill,\r\nat the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in\r\nhonour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home\r\nto Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play\r\nat blindman's-buff.\r\n\r\nScrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual\r\nmelancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and\r\nbeguiled the rest of the evening with his\r\nbanker's-book, went home to bed. He lived in\r\nchambers which had once belonged to his deceased\r\npartner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a\r\nlowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so\r\nlittle business to be, that one could scarcely help\r\nfancying it must have run there when it was a young\r\nhouse, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses,\r\nand forgotten the way out again. It was old enough\r\nnow, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but\r\nScrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.\r\nThe yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew\r\nits every stone, was fain to grope with his hands.\r\nThe fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway\r\nof the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of\r\nthe Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\r\nthreshold.\r\n\r\nNow, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all\r\nparticular about the knocker on the door, except that it\r\nwas very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had\r\nseen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\r\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what\r\nis called fancy about him as any man in the city of\r\nLondon, even including--which is a bold word--the\r\ncorporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be\r\nborne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one\r\nthought on Marley, since his last mention of his\r\nseven years' dead partner that afternoon. And then\r\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened\r\nthat Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door,\r\nsaw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate\r\nprocess of change--not a knocker, but Marley's face.\r\n\r\nMarley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow\r\nas the other objects in the yard were, but had a\r\ndismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark\r\ncellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked\r\nat Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly\r\nspectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The\r\nhair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\r\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly\r\nmotionless. That, and its livid colour, made it\r\nhorrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the\r\nface and beyond its control, rather than a part of\r\nits own expression.\r\n\r\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it\r\nwas a knocker again.\r\n\r\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood\r\nwas not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it\r\nhad been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue.\r\nBut he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished,\r\nturned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\r\n\r\nHe did pause, with a moment's irresolution, before\r\nhe shut the door; and he did look cautiously behind\r\nit first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the\r\nsight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the hall.\r\nBut there was nothing on the back of the door, except\r\nthe screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he\r\nsaid \"Pooh, pooh!\" and closed it with a bang.\r\n\r\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder.\r\nEvery room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant's\r\ncellars below, appeared to have a separate peal\r\nof echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to\r\nbe frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and\r\nwalked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too:\r\ntrimming his candle as he went.\r\n\r\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six\r\nup a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad\r\nyoung Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you\r\nmight have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken\r\nit broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall\r\nand the door towards the balustrades: and done it\r\neasy. There was plenty of width for that, and room\r\nto spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge\r\nthought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before\r\nhim in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of\r\nthe street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well,\r\nso you may suppose that it was pretty dark with\r\nScrooge's dip.\r\n\r\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that.\r\nDarkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But before\r\nhe shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms\r\nto see that all was right. He had just enough recollection\r\nof the face to desire to do that.\r\n\r\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they\r\nshould be. Nobody under the table, nobody under\r\nthe sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin\r\nready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had\r\na cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under the\r\nbed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown,\r\nwhich was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\r\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard,\r\nold shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three\r\nlegs, and a poker.\r\n\r\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked\r\nhimself in; double-locked himself in, which was not his\r\ncustom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off\r\nhis cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and\r\nhis nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take\r\nhis gruel.\r\n\r\nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a\r\nbitter night. He was obliged to sit close to it, and\r\nbrood over it, before he could extract the least\r\nsensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel.\r\nThe fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch\r\nmerchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint\r\nDutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.\r\nThere were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters;\r\nQueens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending\r\nthrough the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams,\r\nBelshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats,\r\nhundreds of figures to attract his thoughts;\r\nand yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came\r\nlike the ancient Prophet's rod, and swallowed up the\r\nwhole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at first,\r\nwith power to shape some picture on its surface from\r\nthe disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would\r\nhave been a copy of old Marley's head on every one.\r\n\r\n\"Humbug!\" said Scrooge; and walked across the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nAfter several turns, he sat down again. As he\r\nthrew his head back in the chair, his glance happened\r\nto rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the\r\nroom, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten\r\nwith a chamber in the highest story of the\r\nbuilding. It was with great astonishment, and with\r\na strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he\r\nsaw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in\r\nthe outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it\r\nrang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.\r\n\r\nThis might have lasted half a minute, or a minute,\r\nbut it seemed an hour. The bells ceased as they had\r\nbegun, together. They were succeeded by a clanking\r\nnoise, deep down below; as if some person were\r\ndragging a heavy chain over the casks in the\r\nwine-merchant's cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have\r\nheard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as\r\ndragging chains.\r\n\r\nThe cellar-door flew open with a booming sound,\r\nand then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors\r\nbelow; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight\r\ntowards his door.\r\n\r\n\"It's humbug still!\" said Scrooge. \"I won't believe it.\"\r\n\r\nHis colour changed though, when, without a pause,\r\nit came on through the heavy door, and passed into\r\nthe room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the\r\ndying flame leaped up, as though it cried, \"I know\r\nhim; Marley's Ghost!\" and fell again.\r\n\r\nThe same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail,\r\nusual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on\r\nthe latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts,\r\nand the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was\r\nclasped about his middle. It was long, and wound\r\nabout him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge\r\nobserved it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks,\r\nledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel.\r\nHis body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him,\r\nand looking through his waistcoat, could see\r\nthe two buttons on his coat behind.\r\n\r\nScrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no\r\nbowels, but he had never believed it until now.\r\n\r\nNo, nor did he believe it even now. Though he\r\nlooked the phantom through and through, and saw\r\nit standing before him; though he felt the chilling\r\ninfluence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very\r\ntexture of the folded kerchief bound about its head\r\nand chin, which wrapper he had not observed before;\r\nhe was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.\r\n\r\n\"How now!\" said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever.\r\n\"What do you want with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Much!\"--Marley's voice, no doubt about it.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask me who I was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who were you then?\" said Scrooge, raising his\r\nvoice. \"You're particular, for a shade.\" He was going\r\nto say \"to a shade,\" but substituted this, as more\r\nappropriate.\r\n\r\n\"In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you--can you sit down?\" asked Scrooge, looking\r\ndoubtfully at him.\r\n\r\n\"I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do it, then.\"\r\n\r\nScrooge asked the question, because he didn't know\r\nwhether a ghost so transparent might find himself in\r\na condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event\r\nof its being impossible, it might involve the necessity\r\nof an embarrassing explanation. But the ghost sat\r\ndown on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he\r\nwere quite used to it.\r\n\r\n\"You don't believe in me,\" observed the Ghost.\r\n\r\n\"I don't,\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of\r\nyour senses?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you doubt your senses?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said Scrooge, \"a little thing affects them.\r\nA slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may\r\nbe an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of\r\ncheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There's more of\r\ngravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge was not much in the habit of cracking\r\njokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means\r\nwaggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be\r\nsmart, as a means of distracting his own attention,\r\nand keeping down his terror; for the spectre's voice\r\ndisturbed the very marrow in his bones.\r\n\r\nTo sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence\r\nfor a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very\r\ndeuce with him. There was something very awful,\r\ntoo, in the spectre's being provided with an infernal\r\natmosphere of its own. Scrooge could not feel it\r\nhimself, but this was clearly the case; for though the\r\nGhost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts,\r\nand tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour\r\nfrom an oven.\r\n\r\n\"You see this toothpick?\" said Scrooge, returning\r\nquickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned;\r\nand wishing, though it were only for a second, to\r\ndivert the vision's stony gaze from himself.\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" replied the Ghost.\r\n\r\n\"You are not looking at it,\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"But I see it,\" said the Ghost, \"notwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" returned Scrooge, \"I have but to swallow\r\nthis, and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a\r\nlegion of goblins, all of my own creation. Humbug,\r\nI tell you! humbug!\"\r\n\r\nAt this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook\r\nits chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that\r\nScrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself\r\nfrom falling in a swoon. But how much greater was\r\nhis horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage\r\nround its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors,\r\nits lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!\r\n\r\nScrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands\r\nbefore his face.\r\n\r\n\"Mercy!\" he said. \"Dreadful apparition, why do\r\nyou trouble me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Man of the worldly mind!\" replied the Ghost, \"do\r\nyou believe in me or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"I must. But why do spirits\r\nwalk the earth, and why do they come to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is required of every man,\" the Ghost returned,\r\n\"that the spirit within him should walk abroad among\r\nhis fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that\r\nspirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so\r\nafter death. It is doomed to wander through the\r\nworld--oh, woe is me!--and witness what it cannot\r\nshare, but might have shared on earth, and turned to\r\nhappiness!\"\r\n\r\nAgain the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain\r\nand wrung its shadowy hands.\r\n\r\n\"You are fettered,\" said Scrooge, trembling. \"Tell\r\nme why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wear the chain I forged in life,\" replied the Ghost.\r\n\"I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded\r\nit on of my own free will, and of my own free will I\r\nwore it. Is its pattern strange to you?\"\r\n\r\nScrooge trembled more and more.\r\n\r\n\"Or would you know,\" pursued the Ghost, \"the\r\nweight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself?\r\nIt was full as heavy and as long as this, seven\r\nChristmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it, since.\r\nIt is a ponderous chain!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the\r\nexpectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty\r\nor sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\"Jacob,\" he said, imploringly. \"Old Jacob Marley,\r\ntell me more. Speak comfort to me, Jacob!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have none to give,\" the Ghost replied. \"It comes\r\nfrom other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed\r\nby other ministers, to other kinds of men. Nor\r\ncan I tell you what I would. A very little more is\r\nall permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I\r\ncannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked\r\nbeyond our counting-house--mark me!--in life my\r\nspirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our\r\nmoney-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became\r\nthoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets.\r\nPondering on what the Ghost had said, he did so now,\r\nbut without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his\r\nknees.\r\n\r\n\"You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,\"\r\nScrooge observed, in a business-like manner, though\r\nwith humility and deference.\r\n\r\n\"Slow!\" the Ghost repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Seven years dead,\" mused Scrooge. \"And travelling\r\nall the time!\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole time,\" said the Ghost. \"No rest, no\r\npeace. Incessant torture of remorse.\"\r\n\r\n\"You travel fast?\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"On the wings of the wind,\" replied the Ghost.\r\n\r\n\"You might have got over a great quantity of\r\nground in seven years,\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\nThe Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and\r\nclanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of\r\nthe night, that the Ward would have been justified in\r\nindicting it for a nuisance.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,\" cried the\r\nphantom, \"not to know, that ages of incessant labour\r\nby immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into\r\neternity before the good of which it is susceptible is\r\nall developed. Not to know that any Christian spirit\r\nworking kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may\r\nbe, will find its mortal life too short for its vast\r\nmeans of usefulness. Not to know that no space of\r\nregret can make amends for one life's opportunity\r\nmisused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you were always a good man of business,\r\nJacob,\" faltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\n\"Business!\" cried the Ghost, wringing its hands\r\nagain. \"Mankind was my business. The common\r\nwelfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance,\r\nand benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings\r\nof my trade were but a drop of water in the\r\ncomprehensive ocean of my business!\"\r\n\r\nIt held up its chain at arm's length, as if that were\r\nthe cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it\r\nheavily upon the ground again.\r\n\r\n\"At this time of the rolling year,\" the spectre said,\r\n\"I suffer most. Why did I walk through crowds of\r\nfellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never\r\nraise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise\r\nMen to a poor abode! Were there no poor homes to\r\nwhich its light would have conducted me!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge was very much dismayed to hear the\r\nspectre going on at this rate, and began to quake\r\nexceedingly.\r\n\r\n\"Hear me!\" cried the Ghost. \"My time is nearly\r\ngone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" said Scrooge. \"But don't be hard upon\r\nme! Don't be flowery, Jacob! Pray!\"\r\n\r\n\"How it is that I appear before you in a shape that\r\nyou can see, I may not tell. I have sat invisible\r\nbeside you many and many a day.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered,\r\nand wiped the perspiration from his brow.\r\n\r\n\"That is no light part of my penance,\" pursued\r\nthe Ghost. \"I am here to-night to warn you, that you\r\nhave yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate. A\r\nchance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were always a good friend to me,\" said\r\nScrooge. \"Thank'ee!\"\r\n\r\n\"You will be haunted,\" resumed the Ghost, \"by\r\nThree Spirits.\"\r\n\r\nScrooge's countenance fell almost as low as the\r\nGhost's had done.\r\n\r\n\"Is that the chance and hope you mentioned,\r\nJacob?\" he demanded, in a faltering voice.\r\n\r\n\"It is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I think I'd rather not,\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Without their visits,\" said the Ghost, \"you cannot\r\nhope to shun the path I tread. Expect the first to-morrow,\r\nwhen the bell tolls One.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't I take 'em all at once, and have it over,\r\nJacob?\" hinted Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Expect the second on the next night at the same\r\nhour. The third upon the next night when the last\r\nstroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate. Look to see\r\nme no more; and look that, for your own sake, you\r\nremember what has passed between us!\"\r\n\r\nWhen it had said these words, the spectre took its\r\nwrapper from the table, and bound it round its head,\r\nas before. Scrooge knew this, by the smart sound its\r\nteeth made, when the jaws were brought together\r\nby the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again,\r\nand found his supernatural visitor confronting him\r\nin an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and\r\nabout its arm.\r\n\r\nThe apparition walked backward from him; and at\r\nevery step it took, the window raised itself a little,\r\nso that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open.\r\n\r\nIt beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did.\r\nWhen they were within two paces of each other,\r\nMarley's Ghost held up its hand, warning him to\r\ncome no nearer. Scrooge stopped.\r\n\r\nNot so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear:\r\nfor on the raising of the hand, he became sensible\r\nof confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of\r\nlamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and\r\nself-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment,\r\njoined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the\r\nbleak, dark night.\r\n\r\nScrooge followed to the window: desperate in his\r\ncuriosity. He looked out.\r\n\r\nThe air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither\r\nand thither in restless haste, and moaning as they\r\nwent. Every one of them wore chains like Marley's\r\nGhost; some few (they might be guilty governments)\r\nwere linked together; none were free. Many had\r\nbeen personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He\r\nhad been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white\r\nwaistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to\r\nits ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist\r\na wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below,\r\nupon a door-step. The misery with them all was,\r\nclearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in\r\nhuman matters, and had lost the power for ever.\r\n\r\nWhether these creatures faded into mist, or mist\r\nenshrouded them, he could not tell. But they and\r\ntheir spirit voices faded together; and the night became\r\nas it had been when he walked home.\r\n\r\nScrooge closed the window, and examined the door\r\nby which the Ghost had entered. It was double-locked,\r\nas he had locked it with his own hands, and\r\nthe bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say \"Humbug!\"\r\nbut stopped at the first syllable. And being,\r\nfrom the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues\r\nof the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or\r\nthe dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of\r\nthe hour, much in need of repose; went straight to\r\nbed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAVE II:  THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS\r\n\r\nWHEN Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that looking out of bed,\r\nhe could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from\r\nthe opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to\r\npierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a\r\nneighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened\r\nfor the hour.\r\n\r\nTo his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from\r\nsix to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to\r\ntwelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he\r\nwent to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have\r\ngot into the works. Twelve!\r\n\r\nHe touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most\r\npreposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve:\r\nand stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it isn't possible,\" said Scrooge, \"that I can have\r\nslept through a whole day and far into another night. It\r\nisn't possible that anything has happened to the sun, and\r\nthis is twelve at noon!\"\r\n\r\nThe idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed,\r\nand groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub\r\nthe frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he\r\ncould see anything; and could see very little then. All he\r\ncould make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely\r\ncold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro,\r\nand making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been\r\nif night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the\r\nworld.  This was a great relief, because \"three days after sight\r\nof this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his\r\norder,\" and so forth, would have become a mere United States'\r\nsecurity if there were no days to count by.\r\n\r\nScrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought\r\nit over and over and over, and could make nothing of it.  The more he\r\nthought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured\r\nnot to think, the more he thought.\r\n\r\nMarley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved\r\nwithin himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his\r\nmind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first\r\nposition, and presented the same problem to be worked all through,\r\n\"Was it a dream or not?\"\r\n\r\nScrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters\r\nmore, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned\r\nhim of a visitation when the bell tolled one.  He resolved to lie\r\nawake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could\r\nno more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the\r\nwisest resolution in his power.\r\n\r\nThe quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he\r\nmust have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock.\r\nAt length it broke upon his listening ear.\r\n\r\n\"Ding, dong!\"\r\n\r\n\"A quarter past,\" said Scrooge, counting.\r\n\r\n\"Ding, dong!\"\r\n\r\n\"Half-past!\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Ding, dong!\"\r\n\r\n\"A quarter to it,\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Ding, dong!\"\r\n\r\n\"The hour itself,\" said Scrooge, triumphantly, \"and nothing else!\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a\r\ndeep, dull, hollow, melancholy ONE.  Light flashed up in the room\r\nupon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.\r\n\r\nThe curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a\r\nhand. Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his\r\nback, but those to which his face was addressed. The curtains\r\nof his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a\r\nhalf-recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the\r\nunearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now\r\nto you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange figure--like a child: yet not so like a\r\nchild as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural\r\nmedium, which gave him the appearance of having receded\r\nfrom the view, and being diminished to a child's proportions.\r\nIts hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was\r\nwhite as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in\r\nit, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were\r\nvery long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold\r\nwere of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately\r\nformed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic\r\nof the purest white; and round its waist was bound\r\na lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held\r\na branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular\r\ncontradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed\r\nwith summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was,\r\nthat from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear\r\njet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was\r\ndoubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a\r\ngreat extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.\r\n\r\nEven this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing\r\nsteadiness, was not its strangest quality. For as its belt\r\nsparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another,\r\nand what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so\r\nthe figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a\r\nthing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs,\r\nnow a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a\r\nbody: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible\r\nin the dense gloom wherein they melted away. And in the\r\nvery wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and\r\nclear as ever.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to\r\nme?\" asked Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"I am!\"\r\n\r\nThe voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if\r\ninstead of being so close beside him, it were at a distance.\r\n\r\n\"Who, and what are you?\" Scrooge demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.\"\r\n\r\n\"Long Past?\" inquired Scrooge: observant of its dwarfish\r\nstature.\r\n\r\n\"No. Your past.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps, Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if\r\nanybody could have asked him; but he had a special desire\r\nto see the Spirit in his cap; and begged him to be covered.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed the Ghost, \"would you so soon put out,\r\nwith worldly hands, the light I give? Is it not enough\r\nthat you are one of those whose passions made this cap, and\r\nforce me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon\r\nmy brow!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend\r\nor any knowledge of having wilfully \"bonneted\" the Spirit at\r\nany period of his life. He then made bold to inquire what\r\nbusiness brought him there.\r\n\r\n\"Your welfare!\" said the Ghost.\r\n\r\nScrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not\r\nhelp thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been\r\nmore conducive to that end. The Spirit must have heard\r\nhim thinking, for it said immediately:\r\n\r\n\"Your reclamation, then. Take heed!\"\r\n\r\nIt put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him\r\ngently by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Rise! and walk with me!\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the\r\nweather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes;\r\nthat bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below\r\nfreezing; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers,\r\ndressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at\r\nthat time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman's hand,\r\nwas not to be resisted. He rose: but finding that the Spirit\r\nmade towards the window, clasped his robe in supplication.\r\n\r\n\"I am a mortal,\" Scrooge remonstrated, \"and liable to fall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bear but a touch of my hand there,\" said the Spirit,\r\nlaying it upon his heart, \"and you shall be upheld in more\r\nthan this!\"\r\n\r\nAs the words were spoken, they passed through the wall,\r\nand stood upon an open country road, with fields on either\r\nhand. The city had entirely vanished. Not a vestige of it\r\nwas to be seen. The darkness and the mist had vanished\r\nwith it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n\"Good Heaven!\" said Scrooge, clasping his hands together,\r\nas he looked about him. \"I was bred in this place. I was\r\na boy here!\"\r\n\r\nThe Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch,\r\nthough it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still\r\npresent to the old man's sense of feeling. He was conscious\r\nof a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected\r\nwith a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares\r\nlong, long, forgotten!\r\n\r\n\"Your lip is trembling,\" said the Ghost. \"And what is\r\nthat upon your cheek?\"\r\n\r\nScrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice,\r\nthat it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him\r\nwhere he would.\r\n\r\n\"You recollect the way?\" inquired the Spirit.\r\n\r\n\"Remember it!\" cried Scrooge with fervour; \"I could\r\nwalk it blindfold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!\" observed\r\nthe Ghost. \"Let us go on.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every\r\ngate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared\r\nin the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river.\r\nSome shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them\r\nwith boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in\r\ncountry gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys\r\nwere in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the\r\nbroad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air\r\nlaughed to hear it!\r\n\r\n\"These are but shadows of the things that have been,\" said\r\nthe Ghost. \"They have no consciousness of us.\"\r\n\r\nThe jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge\r\nknew and named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond\r\nall bounds to see them! Why did his cold eye glisten, and\r\nhis heart leap up as they went past! Why was he filled\r\nwith gladness when he heard them give each other Merry\r\nChristmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for\r\ntheir several homes! What was merry Christmas to Scrooge?\r\nOut upon merry Christmas! What good had it ever done\r\nto him?\r\n\r\n\"The school is not quite deserted,\" said the Ghost. \"A\r\nsolitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.\"\r\n\r\nScrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.\r\n\r\nThey left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and\r\nsoon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little\r\nweathercock-surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell\r\nhanging in it. It was a large house, but one of broken\r\nfortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls\r\nwere damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their\r\ngates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables;\r\nand the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass.\r\nNor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for\r\nentering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open\r\ndoors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished,\r\ncold, and vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a\r\nchilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow\r\nwith too much getting up by candle-light, and not too\r\nmuch to eat.\r\n\r\nThey went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a\r\ndoor at the back of the house. It opened before them, and\r\ndisclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by\r\nlines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of these a lonely\r\nboy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down\r\nupon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he\r\nused to be.\r\n\r\nNot a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle\r\nfrom the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the\r\nhalf-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among\r\nthe leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle\r\nswinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in\r\nthe fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening\r\ninfluence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his\r\nyounger self, intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man, in\r\nforeign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at:\r\nstood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his belt, and\r\nleading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's Ali Baba!\" Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. \"It's\r\ndear old honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know! One Christmas\r\ntime, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone,\r\nhe did come, for the first time, just like that. Poor boy! And\r\nValentine,\" said Scrooge, \"and his wild brother, Orson; there\r\nthey go! And what's his name, who was put down in his\r\ndrawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don't you see him!\r\nAnd the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the Genii;\r\nthere he is upon his head! Serve him right. I'm glad of it.\r\nWhat business had he to be married to the Princess!\"\r\n\r\nTo hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature\r\non such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between\r\nlaughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited\r\nface; would have been a surprise to his business friends in\r\nthe city, indeed.\r\n\r\n\"There's the Parrot!\" cried Scrooge. \"Green body and\r\nyellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the\r\ntop of his head; there he is! Poor Robin Crusoe, he called\r\nhim, when he came home again after sailing round the\r\nisland. 'Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin\r\nCrusoe?'  The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't.\r\nIt was the Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running\r\nfor his life to the little creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!\"\r\n\r\nThen, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his\r\nusual character, he said, in pity for his former self, \"Poor\r\nboy!\" and cried again.\r\n\r\n\"I wish,\" Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his\r\npocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with his\r\ncuff: \"but it's too late now.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" asked the Spirit.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said Scrooge. \"Nothing. There was a boy\r\nsinging a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should\r\nlike to have given him something: that's all.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand:\r\nsaying as it did so, \"Let us see another Christmas!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the\r\nroom became a little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk,\r\nthe windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the\r\nceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how\r\nall this was brought about, Scrooge knew no more than you\r\ndo. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything\r\nhad happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all\r\nthe other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.\r\n\r\nHe was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly.\r\nScrooge looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of\r\nhis head, glanced anxiously towards the door.\r\n\r\nIt opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy,\r\ncame darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and\r\noften kissing him, addressed him as her \"Dear, dear\r\nbrother.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have come to bring you home, dear brother!\" said the\r\nchild, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh.\r\n\"To bring you home, home, home!\"\r\n\r\n\"Home, little Fan?\" returned the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" said the child, brimful of glee. \"Home, for good\r\nand all. Home, for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder\r\nthan he used to be, that home's like Heaven! He spoke so\r\ngently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that\r\nI was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come\r\nhome; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach\r\nto bring you. And you're to be a man!\" said the child,\r\nopening her eyes, \"and are never to come back here; but\r\nfirst, we're to be together all the Christmas long, and have\r\nthe merriest time in all the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are quite a woman, little Fan!\" exclaimed the boy.\r\n\r\nShe clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his\r\nhead; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on\r\ntiptoe to embrace him. Then she began to drag him, in her\r\nchildish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to\r\ngo, accompanied her.\r\n\r\nA terrible voice in the hall cried, \"Bring down Master\r\nScrooge's box, there!\" and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster\r\nhimself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious\r\ncondescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind\r\nby shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him and his\r\nsister into the veriest old well of a shivering best-parlour that\r\never was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial\r\nand terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold.\r\nHere he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a\r\nblock of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments\r\nof those dainties to the young people: at the same time,\r\nsending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of \"something\"\r\nto the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman,\r\nbut if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had\r\nrather not. Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied\r\non to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster\r\ngood-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove\r\ngaily down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the\r\nhoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens\r\nlike spray.\r\n\r\n\"Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have\r\nwithered,\" said the Ghost. \"But she had a large heart!\"\r\n\r\n\"So she had,\" cried Scrooge. \"You're right. I will not\r\ngainsay it, Spirit. God forbid!\"\r\n\r\n\"She died a woman,\" said the Ghost, \"and had, as I think,\r\nchildren.\"\r\n\r\n\"One child,\" Scrooge returned.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said the Ghost. \"Your nephew!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly,\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough they had but that moment left the school behind\r\nthem, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city,\r\nwhere shadowy passengers passed and repassed; where shadowy\r\ncarts and coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and\r\ntumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough, by\r\nthe dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas\r\ntime again; but it was evening, and the streets were\r\nlighted up.\r\n\r\nThe Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked\r\nScrooge if he knew it.\r\n\r\n\"Know it!\" said Scrooge. \"Was I apprenticed here!\"\r\n\r\nThey went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh\r\nwig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two\r\ninches taller he must have knocked his head against the\r\nceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement:\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it's Fezziwig\r\nalive again!\"\r\n\r\nOld Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the\r\nclock, which pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his\r\nhands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over\r\nhimself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and\r\ncalled out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:\r\n\r\n\"Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly\r\nin, accompanied by his fellow-'prentice.\r\n\r\n\"Dick Wilkins, to be sure!\" said Scrooge to the Ghost.\r\n\"Bless me, yes. There he is. He was very much attached\r\nto me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear, dear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yo ho, my boys!\" said Fezziwig. \"No more work to-night.\r\nChristmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let's\r\nhave the shutters up,\" cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap\r\nof his hands, \"before a man can say Jack Robinson!\"\r\n\r\nYou wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it!\r\nThey charged into the street with the shutters--one, two,\r\nthree--had 'em up in their places--four, five, six--barred\r\n'em and pinned 'em--seven, eight, nine--and came back\r\nbefore you could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.\r\n\r\n\"Hilli-ho!\" cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the\r\nhigh desk, with wonderful agility. \"Clear away, my lads,\r\nand let's have lots of room here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup,\r\nEbenezer!\"\r\n\r\nClear away! There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared\r\naway, or couldn't have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking\r\non. It was done in a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if\r\nit were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was\r\nswept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon\r\nthe fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and\r\nbright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon a winter's\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nIn came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the\r\nlofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty\r\nstomach-aches. In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial\r\nsmile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and\r\nlovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they\r\nbroke. In came all the young men and women employed in\r\nthe business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the\r\nbaker. In came the cook, with her brother's particular friend,\r\nthe milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was\r\nsuspected of not having board enough from his master; trying\r\nto hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who\r\nwas proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress.\r\nIn they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly,\r\nsome gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling;\r\nin they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went,\r\ntwenty couple at once; hands half round and back again\r\nthe other way; down the middle and up again; round\r\nand round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old\r\ntop couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top\r\ncouple starting off again, as soon as they got there; all top\r\ncouples at last, and not a bottom one to help them! When\r\nthis result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his\r\nhands to stop the dance, cried out, \"Well done!\" and the\r\nfiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially\r\nprovided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his\r\nreappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no\r\ndancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home,\r\nexhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man\r\nresolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.\r\n\r\nThere were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more\r\ndances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there\r\nwas a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece\r\nof Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer.\r\nBut the great effect of the evening came after the Roast\r\nand Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort\r\nof man who knew his business better than you or I could\r\nhave told it him!) struck up \"Sir Roger de Coverley.\"  Then\r\nold Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top\r\ncouple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them;\r\nthree or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were\r\nnot to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had no\r\nnotion of walking.\r\n\r\nBut if they had been twice as many--ah, four times--old\r\nFezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would\r\nMrs. Fezziwig. As to her, she was worthy to be his partner\r\nin every sense of the term. If that's not high praise, tell me\r\nhigher, and I'll use it. A positive light appeared to issue\r\nfrom Fezziwig's calves. They shone in every part of the\r\ndance like moons. You couldn't have predicted, at any given\r\ntime, what would have become of them next. And when old\r\nFezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the dance;\r\nadvance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and\r\ncurtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to\r\nyour place; Fezziwig \"cut\"--cut so deftly, that he appeared\r\nto wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without\r\na stagger.\r\n\r\nWhen the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up.\r\nMr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side\r\nof the door, and shaking hands with every person individually\r\nas he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas.\r\nWhen everybody had retired but the two 'prentices, they did\r\nthe same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away,\r\nand the lads were left to their beds; which were under a\r\ncounter in the back-shop.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a\r\nman out of his wits. His heart and soul were in the scene,\r\nand with his former self. He corroborated everything,\r\nremembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent\r\nthe strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the\r\nbright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from\r\nthem, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious\r\nthat it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its\r\nhead burnt very clear.\r\n\r\n\"A small matter,\" said the Ghost, \"to make these silly\r\nfolks so full of gratitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"Small!\" echoed Scrooge.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices,\r\nwho were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig:\r\nand when he had done so, said,\r\n\r\n\"Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of\r\nyour mortal money: three or four perhaps. Is that so\r\nmuch that he deserves this praise?\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't that,\" said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and\r\nspeaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self.\r\n\"It isn't that, Spirit. He has the power to render us happy\r\nor unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a\r\npleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and\r\nlooks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is\r\nimpossible to add and count 'em up: what then? The happiness\r\nhe gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.\"\r\n\r\nHe felt the Spirit's glance, and stopped.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" asked the Ghost.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing particular,\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Something, I think?\" the Ghost insisted.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Scrooge, \"No. I should like to be able to say\r\na word or two to my clerk just now. That's all.\"\r\n\r\nHis former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance\r\nto the wish; and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by\r\nside in the open air.\r\n\r\n\"My time grows short,\" observed the Spirit. \"Quick!\"\r\n\r\nThis was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he\r\ncould see, but it produced an immediate effect. For again\r\nScrooge saw himself. He was older now; a man in the prime\r\nof life. His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later\r\nyears; but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice.\r\nThere was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which\r\nshowed the passion that had taken root, and where the\r\nshadow of the growing tree would fall.\r\n\r\nHe was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young\r\ngirl in a mourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears,\r\nwhich sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of\r\nChristmas Past.\r\n\r\n\"It matters little,\" she said, softly. \"To you, very little.\r\nAnother idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort\r\nyou in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have\r\nno just cause to grieve.\"\r\n\r\n\"What Idol has displaced you?\" he rejoined.\r\n\r\n\"A golden one.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is the even-handed dealing of the world!\" he said.\r\n\"There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and\r\nthere is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity\r\nas the pursuit of wealth!\"\r\n\r\n\"You fear the world too much,\" she answered, gently.\r\n\"All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being\r\nbeyond the chance of its sordid reproach. I have seen your\r\nnobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion,\r\nGain, engrosses you. Have I not?\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\" he retorted. \"Even if I have grown so\r\nmuch wiser, what then? I am not changed towards you.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"Am I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were\r\nboth poor and content to be so, until, in good season, we could\r\nimprove our worldly fortune by our patient industry. You\r\nare changed. When it was made, you were another man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was a boy,\" he said impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you\r\nare,\" she returned. \"I am. That which promised happiness\r\nwhen we were one in heart, is fraught with misery now that\r\nwe are two. How often and how keenly I have thought of\r\nthis, I will not say. It is enough that I have thought of it,\r\nand can release you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I ever sought release?\"\r\n\r\n\"In words. No. Never.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another\r\natmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end. In\r\neverything that made my love of any worth or value in your\r\nsight. If this had never been between us,\" said the girl,\r\nlooking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; \"tell me,\r\nwould you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in\r\nspite of himself. But he said with a struggle, \"You think\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would gladly think otherwise if I could,\" she answered,\r\n\"Heaven knows! When I have learned a Truth like this,\r\nI know how strong and irresistible it must be. But if you\r\nwere free to-day, to-morrow, yesterday, can even I believe\r\nthat you would choose a dowerless girl--you who, in your\r\nvery confidence with her, weigh everything by Gain: or,\r\nchoosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your\r\none guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your\r\nrepentance and regret would surely follow? I do; and I\r\nrelease you. With a full heart, for the love of him you\r\nonce were.\"\r\n\r\nHe was about to speak; but with her head turned from\r\nhim, she resumed.\r\n\r\n\"You may--the memory of what is past half makes me\r\nhope you will--have pain in this. A very, very brief time,\r\nand you will dismiss the recollection of it, gladly, as an\r\nunprofitable dream, from which it happened well that you\r\nawoke. May you be happy in the life you have chosen!\"\r\n\r\nShe left him, and they parted.\r\n\r\n\"Spirit!\" said Scrooge, \"show me no more! Conduct\r\nme home. Why do you delight to torture me?\"\r\n\r\n\"One shadow more!\" exclaimed the Ghost.\r\n\r\n\"No more!\" cried Scrooge. \"No more. I don't wish to\r\nsee it. Show me no more!\"\r\n\r\nBut the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms,\r\nand forced him to observe what happened next.\r\n\r\nThey were in another scene and place; a room, not very\r\nlarge or handsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter\r\nfire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Scrooge\r\nbelieved it was the same, until he saw her, now a comely\r\nmatron, sitting opposite her daughter. The noise in this\r\nroom was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children\r\nthere, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;\r\nand, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not\r\nforty children conducting themselves like one, but every\r\nchild was conducting itself like forty. The consequences\r\nwere uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care;\r\non the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily,\r\nand enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to\r\nmingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands\r\nmost ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of\r\nthem! Though I never could have been so rude, no, no! I\r\nwouldn't for the wealth of all the world have crushed that\r\nbraided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little\r\nshoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to\r\nsave my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they\r\ndid, bold young brood, I couldn't have done it; I should\r\nhave expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment,\r\nand never come straight again. And yet I should\r\nhave dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have\r\nquestioned her, that she might have opened them; to have\r\nlooked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never\r\nraised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of\r\nwhich would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should\r\nhave liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence\r\nof a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nBut now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a\r\nrush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and\r\nplundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed\r\nand boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who\r\ncame home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys\r\nand presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and\r\nthe onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter!\r\nThe scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his\r\npockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight\r\nby his cravat, hug him round his neck, pommel his back,\r\nand kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The shouts of\r\nwonder and delight with which the development of every\r\npackage was received! The terrible announcement that the\r\nbaby had been taken in the act of putting a doll's frying-pan\r\ninto his mouth, and was more than suspected of having\r\nswallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter!\r\nThe immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy,\r\nand gratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike.\r\nIt is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions\r\ngot out of the parlour, and by one stair at a time, up to the\r\ntop of the house; where they went to bed, and so subsided.\r\n\r\nAnd now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever,\r\nwhen the master of the house, having his daughter leaning\r\nfondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his\r\nown fireside; and when he thought that such another\r\ncreature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might\r\nhave called him father, and been a spring-time in the\r\nhaggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed.\r\n\r\n\"Belle,\" said the husband, turning to his wife with a\r\nsmile, \"I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess!\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I? Tut, don't I know?\" she added in the\r\nsame breath, laughing as he laughed. \"Mr. Scrooge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as\r\nit was not shut up, and he had a candle inside, I could\r\nscarcely help seeing him. His partner lies upon the point\r\nof death, I hear; and there he sat alone. Quite alone in\r\nthe world, I do believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spirit!\" said Scrooge in a broken voice, \"remove me\r\nfrom this place.\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you these were shadows of the things that have\r\nbeen,\" said the Ghost. \"That they are what they are, do\r\nnot blame me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Remove me!\" Scrooge exclaimed, \"I cannot bear it!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon\r\nhim with a face, in which in some strange way there were\r\nfragments of all the faces it had shown him, wrestled with it.\r\n\r\n\"Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!\"\r\n\r\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which\r\nthe Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was\r\nundisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Scrooge observed\r\nthat its light was burning high and bright; and dimly\r\nconnecting that with its influence over him, he seized the\r\nextinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down\r\nupon its head.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher\r\ncovered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down\r\nwith all his force, he could not hide the light: which streamed\r\nfrom under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.\r\n\r\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an\r\nirresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own\r\nbedroom.  He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand\r\nrelaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank\r\ninto a heavy sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAVE III:  THE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS\r\n\r\nAWAKING in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and\r\nsitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had\r\nno occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the\r\nstroke of One. He felt that he was restored to consciousness\r\nin the right nick of time, for the especial purpose of holding\r\na conference with the second messenger despatched to him\r\nthrough Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he\r\nturned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which\r\nof his curtains this new spectre would draw back, he put\r\nthem every one aside with his own hands; and lying down\r\nagain, established a sharp look-out all round the bed. For\r\nhe wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\r\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise, and\r\nmade nervous.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves\r\non being acquainted with a move or two, and being usually\r\nequal to the time-of-day, express the wide range of their\r\ncapacity for adventure by observing that they are good for\r\nanything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter; between which\r\nopposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide and\r\ncomprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for\r\nScrooge quite as hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you\r\nto believe that he was ready for a good broad field of\r\nstrange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and\r\nrhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\r\n\r\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by\r\nany means prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the\r\nBell struck One, and no shape appeared, he was taken with a\r\nviolent fit of trembling. Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter\r\nof an hour went by, yet nothing came. All this time, he lay\r\nupon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy\r\nlight, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\r\nhour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than\r\na dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it\r\nmeant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive\r\nthat he might be at that very moment an interesting case of\r\nspontaneous combustion, without having the consolation of\r\nknowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you or\r\nI would have thought at first; for it is always the person not\r\nin the predicament who knows what ought to have been done\r\nin it, and would unquestionably have done it too--at last, I\r\nsay, he began to think that the source and secret of this\r\nghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence,\r\non further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea taking\r\nfull possession of his mind, he got up softly and shuffled in\r\nhis slippers to the door.\r\n\r\nThe moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock, a strange\r\nvoice called him by his name, and bade him enter. He\r\nobeyed.\r\n\r\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that.\r\nBut it had undergone a surprising transformation. The walls\r\nand ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a\r\nperfect grove; from every part of which, bright gleaming\r\nberries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and\r\nivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had\r\nbeen scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring\r\nup the chimney, as that dull petrification of a hearth had\r\nnever known in Scrooge's time, or Marley's, or for many and\r\nmany a winter season gone. Heaped up on the floor, to form\r\na kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn,\r\ngreat joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,\r\nmince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,\r\ncherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears,\r\nimmense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that\r\nmade the chamber dim with their delicious steam. In easy\r\nstate upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to\r\nsee; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty's\r\nhorn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge,\r\nas he came peeping round the door.\r\n\r\n\"Come in!\" exclaimed the Ghost. \"Come in! and know\r\nme better, man!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this\r\nSpirit. He was not the dogged Scrooge he had been; and\r\nthough the Spirit's eyes were clear and kind, he did not like\r\nto meet them.\r\n\r\n\"I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,\" said the Spirit.\r\n\"Look upon me!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple\r\ngreen robe, or mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment\r\nhung so loosely on the figure, that its capacious breast was\r\nbare, as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any\r\nartifice. Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the\r\ngarment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other\r\ncovering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\r\nicicles. Its dark brown curls were long and free; free as its\r\ngenial face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice,\r\nits unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded\r\nround its middle was an antique scabbard; but no sword\r\nwas in it, and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust.\r\n\r\n\"You have never seen the like of me before!\" exclaimed\r\nthe Spirit.\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" Scrooge made answer to it.\r\n\r\n\"Have never walked forth with the younger members of\r\nmy family; meaning (for I am very young) my elder brothers\r\nborn in these later years?\" pursued the Phantom.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I have,\" said Scrooge. \"I am afraid I have\r\nnot. Have you had many brothers, Spirit?\"\r\n\r\n\"More than eighteen hundred,\" said the Ghost.\r\n\r\n\"A tremendous family to provide for!\" muttered Scrooge.\r\n\r\nThe Ghost of Christmas Present rose.\r\n\r\n\"Spirit,\" said Scrooge submissively, \"conduct me where\r\nyou will. I went forth last night on compulsion, and I learnt\r\na lesson which is working now. To-night, if you have aught\r\nto teach me, let me profit by it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Touch my robe!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.\r\n\r\nHolly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game,\r\npoultry, brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings,\r\nfruit, and punch, all vanished instantly. So did the room,\r\nthe fire, the ruddy glow, the hour of night, and they stood\r\nin the city streets on Christmas morning, where (for the\r\nweather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk and\r\nnot unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the\r\npavement in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of\r\ntheir houses, whence it was mad delight to the boys to see\r\nit come plumping down into the road below, and splitting\r\ninto artificial little snow-storms.\r\n\r\nThe house fronts looked black enough, and the windows\r\nblacker, contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow\r\nupon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground;\r\nwhich last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by\r\nthe heavy wheels of carts and waggons; furrows that crossed\r\nand re-crossed each other hundreds of times where the great\r\nstreets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace\r\nin the thick yellow mud and icy water. The sky was gloomy,\r\nand the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist,\r\nhalf thawed, half frozen, whose heavier particles descended\r\nin a shower of sooty atoms, as if all the chimneys in Great\r\nBritain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were blazing away\r\nto their dear hearts' content. There was nothing very cheerful\r\nin the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of\r\ncheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest\r\nsummer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain.\r\n\r\nFor, the people who were shovelling away on the housetops\r\nwere jovial and full of glee; calling out to one another\r\nfrom the parapets, and now and then exchanging a facetious\r\nsnowball--better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest--\r\nlaughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it\r\nwent wrong. The poulterers' shops were still half open, and the\r\nfruiterers' were radiant in their glory. There were great, round,\r\npot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats\r\nof jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out\r\ninto the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were\r\nruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in\r\nthe fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking\r\nfrom their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went\r\nby, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were\r\npears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there\r\nwere bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers' benevolence\r\nto dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people's mouths might\r\nwater gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy\r\nand brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among\r\nthe woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered\r\nleaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting\r\noff the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great\r\ncompactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and\r\nbeseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after\r\ndinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth among\r\nthese choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and\r\nstagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was\r\nsomething going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and\r\nround their little world in slow and passionless excitement.\r\n\r\nThe Grocers'! oh, the Grocers'! nearly closed, with perhaps\r\ntwo shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such\r\nglimpses! It was not alone that the scales descending on the\r\ncounter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller\r\nparted company so briskly, or that the canisters were rattled\r\nup and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended\r\nscents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even\r\nthat the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so\r\nextremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight,\r\nthe other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and\r\nspotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on\r\nfeel faint and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that the figs\r\nwere moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in\r\nmodest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that\r\neverything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but\r\nthe customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful\r\npromise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other\r\nat the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left\r\ntheir purchases upon the counter, and came running back to\r\nfetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in\r\nthe best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people\r\nwere so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which\r\nthey fastened their aprons behind might have been their own,\r\nworn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws\r\nto peck at if they chose.\r\n\r\nBut soon the steeples called good people all, to church and\r\nchapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in\r\ntheir best clothes, and with their gayest faces. And at the\r\nsame time there emerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and\r\nnameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners\r\nto the bakers' shops. The sight of these poor revellers\r\nappeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with\r\nScrooge beside him in a baker's doorway, and taking off the\r\ncovers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their\r\ndinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon kind\r\nof torch, for once or twice when there were angry words\r\nbetween some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he\r\nshed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good\r\nhumour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame\r\nto quarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love\r\nit, so it was!\r\n\r\nIn time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and\r\nyet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners\r\nand the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of\r\nwet above each baker's oven; where the pavement smoked as\r\nif its stones were cooking too.\r\n\r\n\"Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from\r\nyour torch?\" asked Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"There is. My own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?\"\r\nasked Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"To any kindly given. To a poor one most.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why to a poor one most?\" asked Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Because it needs it most.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spirit,\" said Scrooge, after a moment's thought, \"I wonder\r\nyou, of all the beings in the many worlds about us, should\r\ndesire to cramp these people's opportunities of innocent\r\nenjoyment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I!\" cried the Spirit.\r\n\r\n\"You would deprive them of their means of dining every\r\nseventh day, often the only day on which they can be said\r\nto dine at all,\" said Scrooge. \"Wouldn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I!\" cried the Spirit.\r\n\r\n\"You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day?\" said\r\nScrooge. \"And it comes to the same thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I seek!\" exclaimed the Spirit.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your\r\nname, or at least in that of your family,\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"There are some upon this earth of yours,\" returned the Spirit,\r\n\"who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion,\r\npride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness\r\nin our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and\r\nkin, as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge\r\ntheir doings on themselves, not us.\"\r\n\r\nScrooge promised that he would; and they went on,\r\ninvisible, as they had been before, into the suburbs of the\r\ntown. It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which\r\nScrooge had observed at the baker's), that notwithstanding\r\nhis gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place\r\nwith ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as\r\ngracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible\r\nhe could have done in any lofty hall.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in\r\nshowing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind,\r\ngenerous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor\r\nmen, that led him straight to Scrooge's clerk's; for there he\r\nwent, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and\r\non the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped\r\nto bless Bob Cratchit's dwelling with the sprinkling of his\r\ntorch. Think of that! Bob had but fifteen \"Bob\" a-week\r\nhimself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his\r\nChristian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present\r\nblessed his four-roomed house!\r\n\r\nThen up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out\r\nbut poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons,\r\nwhich are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and\r\nshe laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of\r\nher daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter\r\nCratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and\r\ngetting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob's private\r\nproperty, conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the\r\nday) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly\r\nattired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks.\r\nAnd now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing\r\nin, screaming that outside the baker's they had smelt the\r\ngoose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious\r\nthoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced\r\nabout the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the\r\nskies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked\r\nhim) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up,\r\nknocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and\r\npeeled.\r\n\r\n\"What has ever got your precious father then?\" said Mrs.\r\nCratchit. \"And your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha\r\nwarn't as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here's Martha, mother!\" said a girl, appearing as she\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\"Here's Martha, mother!\" cried the two young Cratchits.\r\n\"Hurrah! There's such a goose, Martha!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!\"\r\nsaid Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off\r\nher shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.\r\n\r\n\"We'd a deal of work to finish up last night,\" replied the\r\ngirl, \"and had to clear away this morning, mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well! Never mind so long as you are come,\" said Mrs.\r\nCratchit. \"Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have\r\na warm, Lord bless ye!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! There's father coming,\" cried the two young\r\nCratchits, who were everywhere at once. \"Hide, Martha,\r\nhide!\"\r\n\r\nSo Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father,\r\nwith at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe,\r\nhanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned\r\nup and brushed, to look seasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his\r\nshoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and\r\nhad his limbs supported by an iron frame!\r\n\r\n\"Why, where's our Martha?\" cried Bob Cratchit, looking\r\nround.\r\n\r\n\"Not coming,\" said Mrs. Cratchit.\r\n\r\n\"Not coming!\" said Bob, with a sudden declension in his\r\nhigh spirits; for he had been Tim's blood horse all the way\r\nfrom church, and had come home rampant. \"Not coming\r\nupon Christmas Day!\"\r\n\r\nMartha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only\r\nin joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet\r\ndoor, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits\r\nhustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash-house,\r\nthat he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.\r\n\r\n\"And how did little Tim behave?\" asked Mrs. Cratchit,\r\nwhen she had rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had\r\nhugged his daughter to his heart's content.\r\n\r\n\"As good as gold,\" said Bob, \"and better. Somehow he\r\ngets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the\r\nstrangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home,\r\nthat he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he\r\nwas a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember\r\nupon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind\r\nmen see.\"\r\n\r\nBob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and\r\ntrembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing\r\nstrong and hearty.\r\n\r\nHis active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back\r\ncame Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by\r\nhis brother and sister to his stool before the fire; and while\r\nBob, turning up his cuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were\r\ncapable of being made more shabby--compounded some hot\r\nmixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round\r\nand round and put it on the hob to simmer; Master Peter,\r\nand the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the\r\ngoose, with which they soon returned in high procession.\r\n\r\nSuch a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose\r\nthe rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a\r\nblack swan was a matter of course--and in truth it was\r\nsomething very like it in that house. Mrs. Cratchit made\r\nthe gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot;\r\nMaster Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour;\r\nMiss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted\r\nthe hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny\r\ncorner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for\r\neverybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard\r\nupon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\r\nthey should shriek for goose before their turn came to be\r\nhelped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was\r\nsaid. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs.\r\nCratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared\r\nto plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the\r\nlong expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of\r\ndelight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim,\r\nexcited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with\r\nthe handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!\r\n\r\nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe\r\nthere ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and\r\nflavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal\r\nadmiration. Eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes,\r\nit was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as\r\nMrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small\r\natom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at\r\nlast! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest\r\nCratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to\r\nthe eyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss\r\nBelinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous to\r\nbear witnesses--to take the pudding up and bring it in.\r\n\r\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should\r\nbreak in turning out! Suppose somebody should have got\r\nover the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they\r\nwere merry with the goose--a supposition at which the two\r\nyoung Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of\r\nthe copper. A smell like a washing-day! That was the\r\ncloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook's next\r\ndoor to each other, with a laundress's next door to that!\r\nThat was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit\r\nentered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding,\r\nlike a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half\r\nof half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with\r\nChristmas holly stuck into the top.\r\n\r\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly\r\ntoo, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by\r\nMrs. Cratchit since their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that\r\nnow the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had\r\nhad her doubts about the quantity of flour. Everybody had\r\nsomething to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\r\nwas at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have\r\nbeen flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed\r\nto hint at such a thing.\r\n\r\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the\r\nhearth swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the\r\njug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges\r\nwere put upon the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts on the\r\nfire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth, in\r\nwhat Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and\r\nat Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.\r\nTwo tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.\r\n\r\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as\r\ngolden goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with\r\nbeaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and\r\ncracked noisily. Then Bob proposed:\r\n\r\n\"A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!\"\r\n\r\nWhich all the family re-echoed.\r\n\r\n\"God bless us every one!\" said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\r\n\r\nHe sat very close to his father's side upon his little\r\nstool. Bob held his withered little hand in his, as if he\r\nloved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and\r\ndreaded that he might be taken from him.\r\n\r\n\"Spirit,\" said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt\r\nbefore, \"tell me if Tiny Tim will live.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see a vacant seat,\" replied the Ghost, \"in the poor\r\nchimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully\r\npreserved. If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future,\r\nthe child will die.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Scrooge. \"Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he\r\nwill be spared.\"\r\n\r\n\"If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none\r\nother of my race,\" returned the Ghost, \"will find him here.\r\nWhat then? If he be like to die, he had better do it, and\r\ndecrease the surplus population.\"\r\n\r\nScrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by\r\nthe Spirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief.\r\n\r\n\"Man,\" said the Ghost, \"if man you be in heart, not\r\nadamant, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered\r\nWhat the surplus is, and Where it is. Will you decide what\r\nmen shall live, what men shall die? It may be, that in the\r\nsight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live\r\nthan millions like this poor man's child. Oh God! to hear\r\nthe Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life\r\namong his hungry brothers in the dust!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke, and trembling cast\r\nhis eyes upon the ground. But he raised them speedily, on\r\nhearing his own name.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Scrooge!\" said Bob; \"I'll give you Mr. Scrooge, the\r\nFounder of the Feast!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Founder of the Feast indeed!\" cried Mrs. Cratchit,\r\nreddening. \"I wish I had him here. I'd give him a piece\r\nof my mind to feast upon, and I hope he'd have a good\r\nappetite for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" said Bob, \"the children! Christmas Day.\"\r\n\r\n\"It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,\" said she, \"on\r\nwhich one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard,\r\nunfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge. You know he is, Robert!\r\nNobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" was Bob's mild answer, \"Christmas Day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll drink his health for your sake and the Day's,\" said\r\nMrs. Cratchit, \"not for his. Long life to him! A merry\r\nChristmas and a happy new year! He'll be very merry and\r\nvery happy, I have no doubt!\"\r\n\r\nThe children drank the toast after her. It was the first of\r\ntheir proceedings which had no heartiness. Tiny Tim drank\r\nit last of all, but he didn't care twopence for it. Scrooge\r\nwas the Ogre of the family. The mention of his name cast\r\na dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full\r\nfive minutes.\r\n\r\nAfter it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than\r\nbefore, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done\r\nwith. Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his\r\neye for Master Peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full\r\nfive-and-sixpence weekly. The two young Cratchits laughed\r\ntremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man of business;\r\nand Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from\r\nbetween his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular\r\ninvestments he should favour when he came into the receipt\r\nof that bewildering income. Martha, who was a poor\r\napprentice at a milliner's, then told them what kind of work\r\nshe had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch,\r\nand how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a\r\ngood long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at\r\nhome. Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some\r\ndays before, and how the lord \"was much about as tall as\r\nPeter;\" at which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you\r\ncouldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All this\r\ntime the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and\r\nby-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in\r\nthe snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice,\r\nand sang it very well indeed.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing of high mark in this. They were not\r\na handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes\r\nwere far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty;\r\nand Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside\r\nof a pawnbroker's. But, they were happy, grateful, pleased\r\nwith one another, and contented with the time; and when\r\nthey faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings\r\nof the Spirit's torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon\r\nthem, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty\r\nheavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets,\r\nthe brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and\r\nall sorts of rooms, was wonderful. Here, the flickering of\r\nthe blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot\r\nplates baking through and through before the fire, and deep\r\nred curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.\r\nThere all the children of the house were running out\r\ninto the snow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins,\r\nuncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them. Here, again,\r\nwere shadows on the window-blind of guests assembling; and\r\nthere a group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted,\r\nand all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\r\nneighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw\r\nthem enter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!\r\n\r\nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on\r\ntheir way to friendly gatherings, you might have thought\r\nthat no one was at home to give them welcome when they\r\ngot there, instead of every house expecting company, and\r\npiling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\r\nthe Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and\r\nopened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with\r\na generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything\r\nwithin its reach! The very lamplighter, who ran on before,\r\ndotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was\r\ndressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly\r\nas the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter\r\nthat he had any company but Christmas!\r\n\r\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they\r\nstood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses\r\nof rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place\r\nof giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed,\r\nor would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner;\r\nand nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass.\r\nDown in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\r\nred, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a\r\nsullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in\r\nthe thick gloom of darkest night.\r\n\r\n\"What place is this?\" asked Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels of\r\nthe earth,\" returned the Spirit. \"But they know me. See!\"\r\n\r\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they\r\nadvanced towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and\r\nstone, they found a cheerful company assembled round a\r\nglowing fire. An old, old man and woman, with their\r\nchildren and their children's children, and another generation\r\nbeyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\r\nThe old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling\r\nof the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a\r\nChristmas song--it had been a very old song when he was a\r\nboy--and from time to time they all joined in the chorus.\r\nSo surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite\r\nblithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour\r\nsank again.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his\r\nrobe, and passing on above the moor, sped--whither? Not\r\nto sea? To sea. To Scrooge's horror, looking back, he saw\r\nthe last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them;\r\nand his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it\r\nrolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it\r\nhad worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\r\n\r\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league\r\nor so from shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed,\r\nthe wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse.\r\nGreat heaps of sea-weed clung to its base, and storm-birds\r\n--born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-weed of the\r\nwater--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\r\n\r\nBut even here, two men who watched the light had made\r\na fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed\r\nout a ray of brightness on the awful sea. Joining their\r\nhorny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they\r\nwished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog; and\r\none of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged and\r\nscarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship\r\nmight be: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea\r\n--on, on--until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any\r\nshore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman\r\nat the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who\r\nhad the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations;\r\nbut every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\r\nhad a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his\r\ncompanion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward\r\nhopes belonging to it. And every man on board, waking or\r\nsleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another\r\non that day than on any day in the year; and had shared\r\nto some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those\r\nhe cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted\r\nto remember him.\r\n\r\nIt was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the\r\nmoaning of the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it\r\nwas to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown\r\nabyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as Death: it\r\nwas a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, to hear\r\na hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge\r\nto recognise it as his own nephew's and to find himself in a\r\nbright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling\r\nby his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving\r\naffability!\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha!\" laughed Scrooge's nephew. \"Ha, ha, ha!\"\r\n\r\nIf you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a\r\nman more blest in a laugh than Scrooge's nephew, all I can\r\nsay is, I should like to know him too. Introduce him to me,\r\nand I'll cultivate his acquaintance.\r\n\r\nIt is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that\r\nwhile there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing\r\nin the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and\r\ngood-humour. When Scrooge's nephew laughed in this way: holding\r\nhis sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the\r\nmost extravagant contortions: Scrooge's niece, by marriage,\r\nlaughed as heartily as he. And their assembled friends being\r\nnot a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!\" cried\r\nScrooge's nephew. \"He believed it too!\"\r\n\r\n\"More shame for him, Fred!\" said Scrooge's niece,\r\nindignantly. Bless those women; they never do anything by\r\nhalves. They are always in earnest.\r\n\r\nShe was very pretty: exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled,\r\nsurprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that\r\nseemed made to be kissed--as no doubt it was; all kinds of\r\ngood little dots about her chin, that melted into one another\r\nwhen she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever\r\nsaw in any little creature's head. Altogether she was what\r\nyou would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory, too.\r\nOh, perfectly satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\"He's a comical old fellow,\" said Scrooge's nephew, \"that's\r\nthe truth: and not so pleasant as he might be. However,\r\nhis offences carry their own punishment, and I have nothing\r\nto say against him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure he is very rich, Fred,\" hinted Scrooge's niece.\r\n\"At least you always tell me so.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of that, my dear!\" said Scrooge's nephew. \"His\r\nwealth is of no use to him. He don't do any good with it.\r\nHe don't make himself comfortable with it. He hasn't the\r\nsatisfaction of thinking--ha, ha, ha!--that he is ever going\r\nto benefit US with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no patience with him,\" observed Scrooge's niece.\r\nScrooge's niece's sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed\r\nthe same opinion.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I have!\" said Scrooge's nephew. \"I am sorry for\r\nhim; I couldn't be angry with him if I tried. Who suffers\r\nby his ill whims! Himself, always. Here, he takes it into\r\nhis head to dislike us, and he won't come and dine with us.\r\nWhat's the consequence? He don't lose much of a dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,\" interrupted\r\nScrooge's niece. Everybody else said the same, and they\r\nmust be allowed to have been competent judges, because\r\nthey had just had dinner; and, with the dessert upon the\r\ntable, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.\r\n\r\n\"Well! I'm very glad to hear it,\" said Scrooge's nephew,\r\n\"because I haven't great faith in these young housekeepers.\r\nWhat do you say, Topper?\"\r\n\r\nTopper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge's niece's\r\nsisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast,\r\nwho had no right to express an opinion on the subject.\r\nWhereat Scrooge's niece's sister--the plump one with the lace\r\ntucker: not the one with the roses--blushed.\r\n\r\n\"Do go on, Fred,\" said Scrooge's niece, clapping her hands.\r\n\"He never finishes what he begins to say! He is such a\r\nridiculous fellow!\"\r\n\r\nScrooge's nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was\r\nimpossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister\r\ntried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was\r\nunanimously followed.\r\n\r\n\"I was only going to say,\" said Scrooge's nephew, \"that\r\nthe consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making\r\nmerry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant\r\nmoments, which could do him no harm. I am sure he loses\r\npleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts,\r\neither in his mouldy old office, or his dusty chambers. I\r\nmean to give him the same chance every year, whether he\r\nlikes it or not, for I pity him. He may rail at Christmas\r\ntill he dies, but he can't help thinking better of it--I defy\r\nhim--if he finds me going there, in good temper, year after\r\nyear, and saying Uncle Scrooge, how are you? If it only\r\nputs him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds,\r\nthat's something; and I think I shook him yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nIt was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking\r\nScrooge. But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much\r\ncaring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any\r\nrate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the\r\nbottle joyously.\r\n\r\nAfter tea, they had some music. For they were a musical\r\nfamily, and knew what they were about, when they sung a\r\nGlee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper, who\r\ncould growl away in the bass like a good one, and never\r\nswell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face\r\nover it. Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and\r\nplayed among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing:\r\nyou might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had\r\nbeen familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the\r\nboarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of\r\nChristmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the\r\nthings that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he\r\nsoftened more and more; and thought that if he could have\r\nlistened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the\r\nkindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands,\r\nwithout resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob\r\nMarley.\r\n\r\nBut they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After\r\na while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children\r\nsometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its\r\nmighty Founder was a child himself. Stop! There was first\r\na game at blind-man's buff. Of course there was. And I\r\nno more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he\r\nhad eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done\r\nthing between him and Scrooge's nephew; and that the\r\nGhost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after\r\nthat plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the\r\ncredulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons,\r\ntumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano,\r\nsmothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went,\r\nthere went he! He always knew where the plump sister was.\r\nHe wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had fallen up\r\nagainst him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would\r\nhave made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would\r\nhave been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly\r\nhave sidled off in the direction of the plump sister.\r\nShe often cried out that it wasn't fair; and it really was not.\r\nBut when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her\r\nsilken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got\r\nher into a corner whence there was no escape; then his\r\nconduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not to\r\nknow her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her\r\nhead-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by\r\npressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain\r\nabout her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told\r\nhim her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in\r\noffice, they were so very confidential together, behind the\r\ncurtains.\r\n\r\nScrooge's niece was not one of the blind-man's buff party,\r\nbut was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool,\r\nin a snug corner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close\r\nbehind her. But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her\r\nlove to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet.\r\nLikewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was\r\nvery great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat\r\nher sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper\r\ncould have told you. There might have been twenty people there,\r\nyoung and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for\r\nwholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that\r\nhis voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with\r\nhis guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too;\r\nfor the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut\r\nin the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in\r\nhis head to be.\r\n\r\nThe Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood,\r\nand looked upon him with such favour, that he begged like\r\na boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed. But\r\nthis the Spirit said could not be done.\r\n\r\n\"Here is a new game,\" said Scrooge. \"One half hour,\r\nSpirit, only one!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew\r\nhad to think of something, and the rest must find out what;\r\nhe only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case\r\nwas. The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed,\r\nelicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live\r\nanimal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an\r\nanimal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes,\r\nand lived in London, and walked about the streets,\r\nand wasn't made a show of, and wasn't led by anybody, and\r\ndidn't live in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market,\r\nand was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a\r\ntiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every fresh\r\nquestion that was put to him, this nephew burst into a\r\nfresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that\r\nhe was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp. At last\r\nthe plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:\r\n\r\n\"I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know\r\nwhat it is!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" cried Fred.\r\n\r\n\"It's your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!\"\r\n\r\nWhich it certainly was. Admiration was the universal\r\nsentiment, though some objected that the reply to \"Is it a\r\nbear?\" ought to have been \"Yes;\" inasmuch as an answer\r\nin the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts\r\nfrom Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency\r\nthat way.\r\n\r\n\"He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure,\" said\r\nFred, \"and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health.\r\nHere is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the\r\nmoment; and I say, 'Uncle Scrooge!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well! Uncle Scrooge!\" they cried.\r\n\r\n\"A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old\r\nman, whatever he is!\" said Scrooge's nephew. \"He wouldn't\r\ntake it from me, but may he have it, nevertheless. Uncle\r\nScrooge!\"\r\n\r\nUncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light\r\nof heart, that he would have pledged the unconscious\r\ncompany in return, and thanked them in an inaudible speech,\r\nif the Ghost had given him time. But the whole scene\r\npassed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his\r\nnephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.\r\n\r\nMuch they saw, and far they went, and many homes they\r\nvisited, but always with a happy end. The Spirit stood\r\nbeside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign lands,\r\nand they were close at home; by struggling men, and they\r\nwere patient in their greater hope; by poverty, and it was\r\nrich. In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery's every\r\nrefuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not\r\nmade fast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his\r\nblessing, and taught Scrooge his precepts.\r\n\r\nIt was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge\r\nhad his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared\r\nto be condensed into the space of time they passed\r\ntogether. It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained\r\nunaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly\r\nolder. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of\r\nit, until they left a children's Twelfth Night party, when,\r\nlooking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place,\r\nhe noticed that its hair was grey.\r\n\r\n\"Are spirits' lives so short?\" asked Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"My life upon this globe, is very brief,\" replied the Ghost.\r\n\"It ends to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-night!\" cried Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"To-night at midnight. Hark! The time is drawing\r\nnear.\"\r\n\r\nThe chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at\r\nthat moment.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,\" said\r\nScrooge, looking intently at the Spirit's robe, \"but I see\r\nsomething strange, and not belonging to yourself, protruding\r\nfrom your skirts. Is it a foot or a claw?\"\r\n\r\n\"It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,\" was\r\nthe Spirit's sorrowful reply. \"Look here.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the foldings of its robe, it brought two children;\r\nwretched, abject, frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt\r\ndown at its feet, and clung upon the outside of its garment.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Man! look here. Look, look, down here!\" exclaimed\r\nthe Ghost.\r\n\r\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling,\r\nwolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility. Where\r\ngraceful youth should have filled their features out, and\r\ntouched them with its freshest tints, a stale and shrivelled\r\nhand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and\r\npulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\r\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No\r\nchange, no degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any\r\ngrade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has\r\nmonsters half so horrible and dread.\r\n\r\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to\r\nhim in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but\r\nthe words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie\r\nof such enormous magnitude.\r\n\r\n\"Spirit! are they yours?\" Scrooge could say no more.\r\n\r\n\"They are Man's,\" said the Spirit, looking down upon\r\nthem. \"And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers.\r\nThis boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both,\r\nand all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for\r\non his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the\r\nwriting be erased. Deny it!\" cried the Spirit, stretching out\r\nits hand towards the city. \"Slander those who tell it ye!\r\nAdmit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse.\r\nAnd bide the end!\"\r\n\r\n\"Have they no refuge or resource?\" cried Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"Are there no prisons?\" said the Spirit, turning on him\r\nfor the last time with his own words. \"Are there no workhouses?\"\r\n\r\nThe bell struck twelve.\r\n\r\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not.\r\nAs the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the\r\nprediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting up his eyes,\r\nbeheld a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like\r\na mist along the ground, towards him.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAVE IV:  THE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\r\n\r\nTHE Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. When\r\nit came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in\r\nthe very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to\r\nscatter gloom and mystery.\r\n\r\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed\r\nits head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible\r\nsave one outstretched hand. But for this it would have been\r\ndifficult to detach its figure from the night, and separate it\r\nfrom the darkness by which it was surrounded.\r\n\r\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside\r\nhim, and that its mysterious presence filled him with a\r\nsolemn dread. He knew no more, for the Spirit neither\r\nspoke nor moved.\r\n\r\n\"I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To\r\nCome?\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"You are about to show me shadows of the things that\r\nhave not happened, but will happen in the time before us,\"\r\nScrooge pursued. \"Is that so, Spirit?\"\r\n\r\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an\r\ninstant in its folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head.\r\nThat was the only answer he received.\r\n\r\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time,\r\nScrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled\r\nbeneath him, and he found that he could hardly stand when\r\nhe prepared to follow it. The Spirit paused a moment, as\r\nobserving his condition, and giving him time to recover.\r\n\r\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him\r\nwith a vague uncertain horror, to know that behind the\r\ndusky shroud, there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon\r\nhim, while he, though he stretched his own to the utmost,\r\ncould see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap\r\nof black.\r\n\r\n\"Ghost of the Future!\" he exclaimed, \"I fear you more\r\nthan any spectre I have seen. But as I know your purpose\r\nis to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another\r\nman from what I was, I am prepared to bear you company,\r\nand do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak\r\nto me?\"\r\n\r\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\n\"Lead on!\" said Scrooge. \"Lead on! The night is\r\nwaning fast, and it is precious time to me, I know. Lead\r\non, Spirit!\"\r\n\r\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him.\r\nScrooge followed in the shadow of its dress, which bore him\r\nup, he thought, and carried him along.\r\n\r\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the city; for the city rather\r\nseemed to spring up about them, and encompass them of its\r\nown act. But there they were, in the heart of it; on\r\n'Change, amongst the merchants; who hurried up and down,\r\nand chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in\r\ngroups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully\r\nwith their great gold seals; and so forth, as Scrooge had\r\nseen them often.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men.\r\nObserving that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge\r\nadvanced to listen to their talk.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, \"I\r\ndon't know much about it, either way. I only know he's\r\ndead.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did he die?\" inquired another.\r\n\r\n\"Last night, I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what was the matter with him?\" asked a third,\r\ntaking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box.\r\n\"I thought he'd never die.\"\r\n\r\n\"God knows,\" said the first, with a yawn.\r\n\r\n\"What has he done with his money?\" asked a red-faced\r\ngentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his\r\nnose, that shook like the gills of a turkey-cock.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't heard,\" said the man with the large chin,\r\nyawning again. \"Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn't\r\nleft it to me. That's all I know.\"\r\n\r\nThis pleasantry was received with a general laugh.\r\n\r\n\"It's likely to be a very cheap funeral,\" said the same\r\nspeaker; \"for upon my life I don't know of anybody to go\r\nto it. Suppose we make up a party and volunteer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind going if a lunch is provided,\" observed the\r\ngentleman with the excrescence on his nose. \"But I must\r\nbe fed, if I make one.\"\r\n\r\nAnother laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,\"\r\nsaid the first speaker, \"for I never wear black gloves, and I\r\nnever eat lunch. But I'll offer to go, if anybody else will.\r\nWhen I come to think of it, I'm not at all sure that I wasn't\r\nhis most particular friend; for we used to stop and speak\r\nwhenever we met. Bye, bye!\"\r\n\r\nSpeakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with\r\nother groups. Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the\r\nSpirit for an explanation.\r\n\r\nThe Phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed\r\nto two persons meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking\r\nthat the explanation might lie here.\r\n\r\nHe knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business:\r\nvery wealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point\r\nalways of standing well in their esteem: in a business point\r\nof view, that is; strictly in a business point of view.\r\n\r\n\"How are you?\" said one.\r\n\r\n\"How are you?\" returned the other.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" said the first. \"Old Scratch has got his own at\r\nlast, hey?\"\r\n\r\n\"So I am told,\" returned the second. \"Cold, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seasonable for Christmas time. You're not a skater, I\r\nsuppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. No. Something else to think of. Good morning!\"\r\n\r\nNot another word. That was their meeting, their\r\nconversation, and their parting.\r\n\r\nScrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the\r\nSpirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so\r\ntrivial; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden\r\npurpose, he set himself to consider what it was likely to be.\r\nThey could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the\r\ndeath of Jacob, his old partner, for that was Past, and this\r\nGhost's province was the Future. Nor could he think of any\r\none immediately connected with himself, to whom he could\r\napply them. But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they\r\napplied they had some latent moral for his own improvement,\r\nhe resolved to treasure up every word he heard,\r\nand everything he saw; and especially to observe the\r\nshadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation\r\nthat the conduct of his future self would give him\r\nthe clue he missed, and would render the solution of these\r\nriddles easy.\r\n\r\nHe looked about in that very place for his own image; but\r\nanother man stood in his accustomed corner, and though the\r\nclock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he\r\nsaw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured\r\nin through the Porch. It gave him little surprise, however;\r\nfor he had been revolving in his mind a change of life, and\r\nthought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried\r\nout in this.\r\n\r\nQuiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its\r\noutstretched hand. When he roused himself from his\r\nthoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand, and\r\nits situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes\r\nwere looking at him keenly. It made him shudder, and feel\r\nvery cold.\r\n\r\nThey left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part\r\nof the town, where Scrooge had never penetrated before,\r\nalthough he recognised its situation, and its bad repute. The\r\nways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched;\r\nthe people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly. Alleys and\r\narchways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of\r\nsmell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the\r\nwhole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.\r\n\r\nFar in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed,\r\nbeetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags,\r\nbottles, bones, and greasy offal, were bought. Upon the floor\r\nwithin, were piled up heaps of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges,\r\nfiles, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds. Secrets\r\nthat few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in\r\nmountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and\r\nsepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a\r\ncharcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal,\r\nnearly seventy years of age; who had screened himself from the\r\ncold air without, by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous\r\ntatters, hung upon a line; and smoked his pipe in all the luxury\r\nof calm retirement.\r\n\r\nScrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this\r\nman, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the\r\nshop. But she had scarcely entered, when another woman,\r\nsimilarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by\r\na man in faded black, who was no less startled by the sight\r\nof them, than they had been upon the recognition of each\r\nother. After a short period of blank astonishment, in which\r\nthe old man with the pipe had joined them, they all three\r\nburst into a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Let the charwoman alone to be the first!\" cried she who\r\nhad entered first. \"Let the laundress alone to be the second;\r\nand let the undertaker's man alone to be the third. Look\r\nhere, old Joe, here's a chance! If we haven't all three met\r\nhere without meaning it!\"\r\n\r\n\"You couldn't have met in a better place,\" said old Joe,\r\nremoving his pipe from his mouth. \"Come into the parlour.\r\nYou were made free of it long ago, you know; and the other\r\ntwo an't strangers. Stop till I shut the door of the shop.\r\nAh! How it skreeks! There an't such a rusty bit of metal\r\nin the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I'm sure there's\r\nno such old bones here, as mine. Ha, ha! We're all suitable\r\nto our calling, we're well matched. Come into the\r\nparlour. Come into the parlour.\"\r\n\r\nThe parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The\r\nold man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and\r\nhaving trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night), with the\r\nstem of his pipe, put it in his mouth again.\r\n\r\nWhile he did this, the woman who had already spoken\r\nthrew her bundle on the floor, and sat down in a flaunting\r\nmanner on a stool; crossing her elbows on her knees, and\r\nlooking with a bold defiance at the other two.\r\n\r\n\"What odds then! What odds, Mrs. Dilber?\" said the\r\nwoman. \"Every person has a right to take care of themselves.\r\nHe always did.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true, indeed!\" said the laundress. \"No man\r\nmore so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why then, don't stand staring as if you was afraid,\r\nwoman; who's the wiser? We're not going to pick holes in\r\neach other's coats, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed!\" said Mrs. Dilber and the man together.\r\n\"We should hope not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then!\" cried the woman. \"That's enough.\r\nWho's the worse for the loss of a few things like these?\r\nNot a dead man, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead, a wicked old\r\nscrew,\" pursued the woman, \"why wasn't he natural in his\r\nlifetime? If he had been, he'd have had somebody to look\r\nafter him when he was struck with Death, instead of lying\r\ngasping out his last there, alone by himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the truest word that ever was spoke,\" said Mrs.\r\nDilber. \"It's a judgment on him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish it was a little heavier judgment,\" replied the\r\nwoman; \"and it should have been, you may depend upon it,\r\nif I could have laid my hands on anything else. Open that\r\nbundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it. Speak out\r\nplain. I'm not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to\r\nsee it. We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves,\r\nbefore we met here, I believe. It's no sin. Open the bundle,\r\nJoe.\"\r\n\r\nBut the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this;\r\nand the man in faded black, mounting the breach first,\r\nproduced his plunder. It was not extensive. A seal or two,\r\na pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no\r\ngreat value, were all. They were severally examined and\r\nappraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed\r\nto give for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a\r\ntotal when he found there was nothing more to come.\r\n\r\n\"That's your account,\" said Joe, \"and I wouldn't give\r\nanother sixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it.\r\nWho's next?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing\r\napparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of\r\nsugar-tongs, and a few boots. Her account was stated on the wall\r\nin the same manner.\r\n\r\n\"I always give too much to ladies. It's a weakness of mine,\r\nand that's the way I ruin myself,\" said old Joe. \"That's\r\nyour account. If you asked me for another penny, and made\r\nit an open question, I'd repent of being so liberal and knock\r\noff half-a-crown.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now undo my bundle, Joe,\" said the first woman.\r\n\r\nJoe went down on his knees for the greater convenience\r\nof opening it, and having unfastened a great many knots,\r\ndragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff.\r\n\r\n\"What do you call this?\" said Joe. \"Bed-curtains!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward\r\non her crossed arms. \"Bed-curtains!\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say you took 'em down, rings and\r\nall, with him lying there?\" said Joe.\r\n\r\n\"Yes I do,\" replied the woman. \"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"You were born to make your fortune,\" said Joe, \"and\r\nyou'll certainly do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly shan't hold my hand, when I can get anything\r\nin it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He\r\nwas, I promise you, Joe,\" returned the woman coolly. \"Don't\r\ndrop that oil upon the blankets, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"His blankets?\" asked Joe.\r\n\r\n\"Whose else's do you think?\" replied the woman. \"He\r\nisn't likely to take cold without 'em, I dare say.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope he didn't die of anything catching? Eh?\" said\r\nold Joe, stopping in his work, and looking up.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you be afraid of that,\" returned the woman. \"I\r\nan't so fond of his company that I'd loiter about him for\r\nsuch things, if he did. Ah! you may look through that\r\nshirt till your eyes ache; but you won't find a hole in it, nor\r\na threadbare place. It's the best he had, and a fine one too.\r\nThey'd have wasted it, if it hadn't been for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you call wasting of it?\" asked old Joe.\r\n\r\n\"Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,\" replied\r\nthe woman with a laugh. \"Somebody was fool enough to\r\ndo it, but I took it off again. If calico an't good enough for\r\nsuch a purpose, it isn't good enough for anything. It's quite\r\nas becoming to the body. He can't look uglier than he did\r\nin that one.\"\r\n\r\nScrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat\r\ngrouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by\r\nthe old man's lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and\r\ndisgust, which could hardly have been greater, though they\r\nhad been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself.\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha!\" laughed the same woman, when old Joe,\r\nproducing a flannel bag with money in it, told out their\r\nseveral gains upon the ground. \"This is the end of it, you\r\nsee! He frightened every one away from him when he was\r\nalive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"Spirit!\" said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. \"I\r\nsee, I see. The case of this unhappy man might be my own.\r\nMy life tends that way, now. Merciful Heaven, what is\r\nthis!\"\r\n\r\nHe recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now\r\nhe almost touched a bed: a bare, uncurtained bed: on which,\r\nbeneath a ragged sheet, there lay a something covered up,\r\nwhich, though it was dumb, announced itself in awful\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThe room was very dark, too dark to be observed with\r\nany accuracy, though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience\r\nto a secret impulse, anxious to know what kind of room it\r\nwas. A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon\r\nthe bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept,\r\nuncared for, was the body of this man.\r\n\r\nScrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand\r\nwas pointed to the head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted\r\nthat the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon\r\nScrooge's part, would have disclosed the face. He thought\r\nof it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to do it;\r\nbut had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss\r\nthe spectre at his side.\r\n\r\nOh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar\r\nhere, and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy\r\ncommand: for this is thy dominion! But of the loved,\r\nrevered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair\r\nto thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is\r\nnot that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released;\r\nit is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the\r\nhand WAS open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm,\r\nand tender; and the pulse a man's. Strike, Shadow, strike!\r\nAnd see his good deeds springing from the wound, to sow\r\nthe world with life immortal!\r\n\r\nNo voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and\r\nyet he heard them when he looked upon the bed. He\r\nthought, if this man could be raised up now, what would be\r\nhis foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard-dealing, griping cares?\r\nThey have brought him to a rich end, truly!\r\n\r\nHe lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a\r\nwoman, or a child, to say that he was kind to me in this\r\nor that, and for the memory of one kind word I will be\r\nkind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was\r\na sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone. What\r\nthey wanted in the room of death, and why they were so\r\nrestless and disturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think.\r\n\r\n\"Spirit!\" he said, \"this is a fearful place. In leaving it,\r\nI shall not leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!\"\r\n\r\nStill the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"I understand you,\" Scrooge returned, \"and I would do\r\nit, if I could. But I have not the power, Spirit. I have\r\nnot the power.\"\r\n\r\nAgain it seemed to look upon him.\r\n\r\n\"If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion\r\ncaused by this man's death,\" said Scrooge quite agonised,\r\n\"show that person to me, Spirit, I beseech you!\"\r\n\r\nThe Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a\r\nmoment, like a wing; and withdrawing it, revealed a room\r\nby daylight, where a mother and her children were.\r\n\r\nShe was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness;\r\nfor she walked up and down the room; started at every\r\nsound; looked out from the window; glanced at the clock;\r\ntried, but in vain, to work with her needle; and could hardly\r\nbear the voices of the children in their play.\r\n\r\nAt length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried\r\nto the door, and met her husband; a man whose face was\r\ncareworn and depressed, though he was young. There was\r\na remarkable expression in it now; a kind of serious delight\r\nof which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to repress.\r\n\r\nHe sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for\r\nhim by the fire; and when she asked him faintly what news\r\n(which was not until after a long silence), he appeared\r\nembarrassed how to answer.\r\n\r\n\"Is it good?\" she said, \"or bad?\"--to help him.\r\n\r\n\"Bad,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"We are quite ruined?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. There is hope yet, Caroline.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he relents,\" she said, amazed, \"there is! Nothing is\r\npast hope, if such a miracle has happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is past relenting,\" said her husband. \"He is dead.\"\r\n\r\nShe was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke\r\ntruth; but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she\r\nsaid so, with clasped hands. She prayed forgiveness the next\r\nmoment, and was sorry; but the first was the emotion of\r\nher heart.\r\n\r\n\"What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last\r\nnight, said to me, when I tried to see him and obtain a\r\nweek's delay; and what I thought was a mere excuse to avoid\r\nme; turns out to have been quite true. He was not only\r\nvery ill, but dying, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"To whom will our debt be transferred?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. But before that time we shall be ready\r\nwith the money; and even though we were not, it would be\r\na bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his\r\nsuccessor. We may sleep to-night with light hearts, Caroline!\"\r\n\r\nYes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter.\r\nThe children's faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what\r\nthey so little understood, were brighter; and it was a happier\r\nhouse for this man's death! The only emotion that the\r\nGhost could show him, caused by the event, was one of\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,\" said\r\nScrooge; \"or that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just\r\nnow, will be for ever present to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar\r\nto his feet; and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and\r\nthere to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen. They\r\nentered poor Bob Cratchit's house; the dwelling he had\r\nvisited before; and found the mother and the children seated\r\nround the fire.\r\n\r\nQuiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as\r\nstill as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter,\r\nwho had a book before him. The mother and her daughters\r\nwere engaged in sewing. But surely they were very quiet!\r\n\r\n\"'And He took a child, and set him in the midst of\r\nthem.'\"\r\n\r\nWhere had Scrooge heard those words? He had not\r\ndreamed them. The boy must have read them out, as he\r\nand the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why did he not\r\ngo on?\r\n\r\nThe mother laid her work upon the table, and put her\r\nhand up to her face.\r\n\r\n\"The colour hurts my eyes,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!\r\n\r\n\"They're better now again,\" said Cratchit's wife. \"It\r\nmakes them weak by candle-light; and I wouldn't show weak\r\neyes to your father when he comes home, for the world. It\r\nmust be near his time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Past it rather,\" Peter answered, shutting up his book.\r\n\"But I think he has walked a little slower than he used,\r\nthese few last evenings, mother.\"\r\n\r\nThey were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a\r\nsteady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once:\r\n\r\n\"I have known him walk with--I have known him walk\r\nwith Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so have I,\" cried Peter. \"Often.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so have I,\" exclaimed another. So had all.\r\n\r\n\"But he was very light to carry,\" she resumed, intent upon\r\nher work, \"and his father loved him so, that it was no\r\ntrouble: no trouble. And there is your father at the door!\"\r\n\r\nShe hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter\r\n--he had need of it, poor fellow--came in. His tea\r\nwas ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should\r\nhelp him to it most. Then the two young Cratchits got\r\nupon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against\r\nhis face, as if they said, \"Don't mind it, father. Don't be\r\ngrieved!\"\r\n\r\nBob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to\r\nall the family. He looked at the work upon the table, and\r\npraised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls.\r\nThey would be done long before Sunday, he said.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?\" said his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear,\" returned Bob. \"I wish you could have\r\ngone. It would have done you good to see how green a\r\nplace it is. But you'll see it often. I promised him that I\r\nwould walk there on a Sunday. My little, little child!\"\r\ncried Bob. \"My little child!\"\r\n\r\nHe broke down all at once. He couldn't help it. If he\r\ncould have helped it, he and his child would have been farther\r\napart perhaps than they were.\r\n\r\nHe left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above,\r\nwhich was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas.\r\nThere was a chair set close beside the child, and there were\r\nsigns of some one having been there, lately. Poor Bob sat\r\ndown in it, and when he had thought a little and composed\r\nhimself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what\r\nhad happened, and went down again quite happy.\r\n\r\nThey drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother\r\nworking still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness\r\nof Mr. Scrooge's nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but\r\nonce, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and seeing\r\nthat he looked a little--\"just a little down you know,\" said\r\nBob, inquired what had happened to distress him. \"On\r\nwhich,\" said Bob, \"for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman\r\nyou ever heard, I told him. 'I am heartily sorry for it, Mr.\r\nCratchit,' he said, 'and heartily sorry for your good wife.'\r\nBy the bye, how he ever knew that, I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Knew what, my dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that you were a good wife,\" replied Bob.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody knows that!\" said Peter.\r\n\r\n\"Very well observed, my boy!\" cried Bob. \"I hope they\r\ndo. 'Heartily sorry,' he said, 'for your good wife. If I\r\ncan be of service to you in any way,' he said, giving me\r\nhis card, 'that's where I live. Pray come to me.' Now, it\r\nwasn't,\" cried Bob, \"for the sake of anything he might be\r\nable to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was\r\nquite delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our\r\nTiny Tim, and felt with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure he's a good soul!\" said Mrs. Cratchit.\r\n\r\n\"You would be surer of it, my dear,\" returned Bob, \"if\r\nyou saw and spoke to him. I shouldn't be at all surprised--\r\nmark what I say!--if he got Peter a better situation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only hear that, Peter,\" said Mrs. Cratchit.\r\n\r\n\"And then,\" cried one of the girls, \"Peter will be keeping\r\ncompany with some one, and setting up for himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get along with you!\" retorted Peter, grinning.\r\n\r\n\"It's just as likely as not,\" said Bob, \"one of these days;\r\nthough there's plenty of time for that, my dear. But however\r\nand whenever we part from one another, I am sure we\r\nshall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim--shall we--or this\r\nfirst parting that there was among us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never, father!\" cried they all.\r\n\r\n\"And I know,\" said Bob, \"I know, my dears, that when\r\nwe recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he\r\nwas a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among\r\nourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, never, father!\" they all cried again.\r\n\r\n\"I am very happy,\" said little Bob, \"I am very happy!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the\r\ntwo young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook\r\nhands. Spirit of Tiny Tim, thy childish essence was from\r\nGod!\r\n\r\n\"Spectre,\" said Scrooge, \"something informs me that our\r\nparting moment is at hand. I know it, but I know not\r\nhow. Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead?\"\r\n\r\nThe Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as\r\nbefore--though at a different time, he thought: indeed, there\r\nseemed no order in these latter visions, save that they were\r\nin the Future--into the resorts of business men, but showed\r\nhim not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for anything,\r\nbut went straight on, as to the end just now desired,\r\nuntil besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"This court,\" said Scrooge, \"through which we hurry now,\r\nis where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length\r\nof time. I see the house. Let me behold what I shall be,\r\nin days to come!\"\r\n\r\nThe Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\"The house is yonder,\" Scrooge exclaimed. \"Why do you\r\npoint away?\"\r\n\r\nThe inexorable finger underwent no change.\r\n\r\nScrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked\r\nin. It was an office still, but not his. The furniture was\r\nnot the same, and the figure in the chair was not himself.\r\nThe Phantom pointed as before.\r\n\r\nHe joined it once again, and wondering why and whither\r\nhe had gone, accompanied it until they reached an iron gate.\r\nHe paused to look round before entering.\r\n\r\nA churchyard. Here, then; the wretched man whose name\r\nhe had now to learn, lay underneath the ground. It was a\r\nworthy place. Walled in by houses; overrun by grass and\r\nweeds, the growth of vegetation's death, not life; choked up\r\nwith too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A\r\nworthy place!\r\n\r\nThe Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to\r\nOne. He advanced towards it trembling. The Phantom was\r\nexactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new\r\nmeaning in its solemn shape.\r\n\r\n\"Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,\"\r\nsaid Scrooge, \"answer me one question. Are these the\r\nshadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of\r\nthings that May be, only?\"\r\n\r\nStill the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which\r\nit stood.\r\n\r\n\"Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if\r\npersevered in, they must lead,\" said Scrooge. \"But if the\r\ncourses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is\r\nthus with what you show me!\"\r\n\r\nThe Spirit was immovable as ever.\r\n\r\nScrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and\r\nfollowing the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected\r\ngrave his own name, EBENEZER SCROOGE.\r\n\r\n\"Am I that man who lay upon the bed?\" he cried, upon\r\nhis knees.\r\n\r\nThe finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.\r\n\r\n\"No, Spirit! Oh no, no!\"\r\n\r\nThe finger still was there.\r\n\r\n\"Spirit!\" he cried, tight clutching at its robe, \"hear me!\r\nI am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must\r\nhave been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, if I\r\nam past all hope!\"\r\n\r\nFor the first time the hand appeared to shake.\r\n\r\n\"Good Spirit,\" he pursued, as down upon the ground he\r\nfell before it: \"Your nature intercedes for me, and pities\r\nme. Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you\r\nhave shown me, by an altered life!\"\r\n\r\nThe kind hand trembled.\r\n\r\n\"I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it\r\nall the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the\r\nFuture. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I\r\nwill not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I\r\nmay sponge away the writing on this stone!\"\r\n\r\nIn his agony, he caught the spectral hand. It sought to\r\nfree itself, but he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it.\r\nThe Spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him.\r\n\r\nHolding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate\r\nreversed, he saw an alteration in the Phantom's hood and dress.\r\nIt shrunk, collapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAVE V:  THE END OF IT\r\n\r\nYES! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own,\r\nthe room was his own. Best and happiest of all, the Time\r\nbefore him was his own, to make amends in!\r\n\r\n\"I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!\"\r\nScrooge repeated, as he scrambled out of bed. \"The Spirits\r\nof all Three shall strive within me. Oh Jacob Marley!\r\nHeaven, and the Christmas Time be praised for this! I say\r\nit on my knees, old Jacob; on my knees!\"\r\n\r\nHe was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions,\r\nthat his broken voice would scarcely answer to his\r\ncall. He had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the\r\nSpirit, and his face was wet with tears.\r\n\r\n\"They are not torn down,\" cried Scrooge, folding one of\r\nhis bed-curtains in his arms, \"they are not torn down, rings\r\nand all. They are here--I am here--the shadows of the\r\nthings that would have been, may be dispelled. They will\r\nbe. I know they will!\"\r\n\r\nHis hands were busy with his garments all this time;\r\nturning them inside out, putting them on upside down,\r\ntearing them, mislaying them, making them parties to every\r\nkind of extravagance.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what to do!\" cried Scrooge, laughing and\r\ncrying in the same breath; and making a perfect Laoco\u00f6n of\r\nhimself with his stockings. \"I am as light as a feather, I\r\nam as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy. I\r\nam as giddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to\r\neverybody! A happy New Year to all the world. Hallo\r\nhere! Whoop! Hallo!\"\r\n\r\nHe had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing\r\nthere: perfectly winded.\r\n\r\n\"There's the saucepan that the gruel was in!\" cried\r\nScrooge, starting off again, and going round the fireplace.\r\n\"There's the door, by which the Ghost of Jacob Marley\r\nentered! There's the corner where the Ghost of Christmas\r\nPresent, sat! There's the window where I saw the wandering\r\nSpirits! It's all right, it's all true, it all happened.\r\nHa ha ha!\"\r\n\r\nReally, for a man who had been out of practice for so\r\nmany years, it was a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh.\r\nThe father of a long, long line of brilliant laughs!\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what day of the month it is!\" said\r\nScrooge. \"I don't know how long I've been among the\r\nSpirits. I don't know anything. I'm quite a baby. Never\r\nmind. I don't care. I'd rather be a baby. Hallo! Whoop!\r\nHallo here!\"\r\n\r\nHe was checked in his transports by the churches ringing\r\nout the lustiest peals he had ever heard. Clash, clang,\r\nhammer; ding, dong, bell. Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang,\r\nclash! Oh, glorious, glorious!\r\n\r\nRunning to the window, he opened it, and put out his\r\nhead. No fog, no mist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold;\r\ncold, piping for the blood to dance to; Golden sunlight;\r\nHeavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry bells. Oh, glorious!\r\nGlorious!\r\n\r\n\"What's to-day!\" cried Scrooge, calling downward to a\r\nboy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\n\"EH?\" returned the boy, with all his might of wonder.\r\n\r\n\"What's to-day, my fine fellow?\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"To-day!\" replied the boy. \"Why, CHRISTMAS DAY.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's Christmas Day!\" said Scrooge to himself. \"I\r\nhaven't missed it. The Spirits have done it all in one night.\r\nThey can do anything they like. Of course they can. Of\r\ncourse they can. Hallo, my fine fellow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!\" returned the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know the Poulterer's, in the next street but one,\r\nat the corner?\" Scrooge inquired.\r\n\r\n\"I should hope I did,\" replied the lad.\r\n\r\n\"An intelligent boy!\" said Scrooge. \"A remarkable boy!\r\nDo you know whether they've sold the prize Turkey that\r\nwas hanging up there?--Not the little prize Turkey: the\r\nbig one?\"\r\n\r\n\"What, the one as big as me?\" returned the boy.\r\n\r\n\"What a delightful boy!\" said Scrooge. \"It's a pleasure\r\nto talk to him. Yes, my buck!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's hanging there now,\" replied the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Is it?\" said Scrooge. \"Go and buy it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Walk-ER!\" exclaimed the boy.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Scrooge, \"I am in earnest. Go and buy\r\nit, and tell 'em to bring it here, that I may give them the\r\ndirection where to take it. Come back with the man, and\r\nI'll give you a shilling. Come back with him in less than\r\nfive minutes and I'll give you half-a-crown!\"\r\n\r\nThe boy was off like a shot. He must have had a steady\r\nhand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast.\r\n\r\n\"I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's!\" whispered Scrooge,\r\nrubbing his hands, and splitting with a laugh. \"He sha'n't\r\nknow who sends it. It's twice the size of Tiny Tim. Joe\r\nMiller never made such a joke as sending it to Bob's\r\nwill be!\"\r\n\r\nThe hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady\r\none, but write it he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to\r\nopen the street door, ready for the coming of the poulterer's\r\nman. As he stood there, waiting his arrival, the knocker\r\ncaught his eye.\r\n\r\n\"I shall love it, as long as I live!\" cried Scrooge, patting\r\nit with his hand. \"I scarcely ever looked at it before.\r\nWhat an honest expression it has in its face! It's a\r\nwonderful knocker!--Here's the Turkey! Hallo! Whoop!\r\nHow are you! Merry Christmas!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a Turkey! He never could have stood upon his\r\nlegs, that bird. He would have snapped 'em short off in a\r\nminute, like sticks of sealing-wax.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's impossible to carry that to Camden Town,\"\r\nsaid Scrooge. \"You must have a cab.\"\r\n\r\nThe chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with\r\nwhich he paid for the Turkey, and the chuckle with which\r\nhe paid for the cab, and the chuckle with which he recompensed\r\nthe boy, were only to be exceeded by the chuckle\r\nwith which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and\r\nchuckled till he cried.\r\n\r\nShaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to\r\nshake very much; and shaving requires attention, even when\r\nyou don't dance while you are at it. But if he had cut the\r\nend of his nose off, he would have put a piece of\r\nsticking-plaister over it, and been quite satisfied.\r\n\r\nHe dressed himself \"all in his best,\" and at last got out\r\ninto the streets. The people were by this time pouring forth,\r\nas he had seen them with the Ghost of Christmas Present;\r\nand walking with his hands behind him, Scrooge regarded\r\nevery one with a delighted smile. He looked so irresistibly\r\npleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured fellows\r\nsaid, \"Good morning, sir! A merry Christmas to you!\"\r\nAnd Scrooge said often afterwards, that of all the blithe\r\nsounds he had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears.\r\n\r\nHe had not gone far, when coming on towards him he\r\nbeheld the portly gentleman, who had walked into his\r\ncounting-house the day before, and said, \"Scrooge and Marley's, I\r\nbelieve?\"  It sent a pang across his heart to think how this\r\nold gentleman would look upon him when they met; but he\r\nknew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir,\" said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and\r\ntaking the old gentleman by both his hands. \"How do you\r\ndo? I hope you succeeded yesterday. It was very kind of\r\nyou. A merry Christmas to you, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Scrooge?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Scrooge. \"That is my name, and I fear it\r\nmay not be pleasant to you. Allow me to ask your pardon.\r\nAnd will you have the goodness\"--here Scrooge whispered in\r\nhis ear.\r\n\r\n\"Lord bless me!\" cried the gentleman, as if his breath\r\nwere taken away. \"My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you please,\" said Scrooge. \"Not a farthing less. A\r\ngreat many back-payments are included in it, I assure you.\r\nWill you do me that favour?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir,\" said the other, shaking hands with him.\r\n\"I don't know what to say to such munifi--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say anything, please,\" retorted Scrooge. \"Come\r\nand see me. Will you come and see me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will!\" cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he\r\nmeant to do it.\r\n\r\n\"Thank'ee,\" said Scrooge. \"I am much obliged to you.\r\nI thank you fifty times. Bless you!\"\r\n\r\nHe went to church, and walked about the streets, and\r\nwatched the people hurrying to and fro, and patted children\r\non the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into\r\nthe kitchens of houses, and up to the windows, and found\r\nthat everything could yield him pleasure. He had never\r\ndreamed that any walk--that anything--could give him so\r\nmuch happiness. In the afternoon he turned his steps\r\ntowards his nephew's house.\r\n\r\nHe passed the door a dozen times, before he had the\r\ncourage to go up and knock. But he made a dash, and\r\ndid it:\r\n\r\n\"Is your master at home, my dear?\" said Scrooge to the\r\ngirl. Nice girl! Very.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he, my love?\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n\"He's in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I'll\r\nshow you up-stairs, if you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank'ee. He knows me,\" said Scrooge, with his hand\r\nalready on the dining-room lock. \"I'll go in here, my dear.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the door.\r\nThey were looking at the table (which was spread out in\r\ngreat array); for these young housekeepers are always nervous\r\non such points, and like to see that everything is right.\r\n\r\n\"Fred!\" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\nDear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started!\r\nScrooge had forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting\r\nin the corner with the footstool, or he wouldn't have done\r\nit, on any account.\r\n\r\n\"Why bless my soul!\" cried Fred, \"who's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner.\r\nWill you let me in, Fred?\"\r\n\r\nLet him in! It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off.\r\nHe was at home in five minutes. Nothing could be heartier.\r\nHis niece looked just the same. So did Topper when he\r\ncame. So did the plump sister when she came. So did\r\nevery one when they came. Wonderful party, wonderful\r\ngames, wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!\r\n\r\nBut he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was\r\nearly there. If he could only be there first, and catch Bob\r\nCratchit coming late! That was the thing he had set his\r\nheart upon.\r\n\r\nAnd he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No\r\nBob. A quarter past. No Bob. He was full eighteen\r\nminutes and a half behind his time. Scrooge sat with his\r\ndoor wide open, that he might see him come into the Tank.\r\n\r\nHis hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter\r\ntoo. He was on his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his\r\npen, as if he were trying to overtake nine o'clock.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!\" growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice, as\r\nnear as he could feign it. \"What do you mean by coming\r\nhere at this time of day?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very sorry, sir,\" said Bob. \"I am behind my time.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are?\" repeated Scrooge. \"Yes. I think you are.\r\nStep this way, sir, if you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's only once a year, sir,\" pleaded Bob, appearing from\r\nthe Tank. \"It shall not be repeated. I was making rather\r\nmerry yesterday, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,\" said Scrooge, \"I\r\nam not going to stand this sort of thing any longer. And\r\ntherefore,\" he continued, leaping from his stool, and giving\r\nBob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into\r\nthe Tank again; \"and therefore I am about to raise your\r\nsalary!\"\r\n\r\nBob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He\r\nhad a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it,\r\nholding him, and calling to the people in the court for help\r\nand a strait-waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\"A merry Christmas, Bob!\" said Scrooge, with an earnestness\r\nthat could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the\r\nback. \"A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I\r\nhave given you, for many a year! I'll raise your salary, and\r\nendeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss\r\nyour affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of\r\nsmoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires, and buy another\r\ncoal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nScrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and\r\ninfinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was\r\na second father. He became as good a friend, as good a\r\nmaster, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or\r\nany other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old\r\nworld. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him,\r\nbut he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was\r\nwise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this\r\nglobe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill\r\nof laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these\r\nwould be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they\r\nshould wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in\r\nless attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was\r\nquite enough for him.\r\n\r\nHe had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon\r\nthe Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was\r\nalways said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas\r\nwell, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that\r\nbe truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim\r\nobserved, God bless Us, Every One!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A CHRISTMAS CAROL ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 46-8.txt or 46-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/4/46/\r\n\r\nProduced by Jose Menendez\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.

It may be unreservedly admitted\r\nthat her association with Shelley, and her care of his writings and\r\nmemory after his death, are the strongest of her titles to remembrance.\r\nIt is further undeniable that the most original of her works is also\r\nthat which betrays the strongest traces of his influence. _Frankenstein_\r\nwas written when her brain, magnetized by his companionship, was capable\r\nof an effort never to be repeated. But if the frame of mind which\r\nengendered and sustained the work was created by Shelley, the conception\r\nwas not his, and the diction is dissimilar to his. Both derive from\r\nGodwin, but neither is Godwin\u2019s. The same observation, except for an\r\noccasional phrase caught from Shelley, applies to all her subsequent\r\nwork. The frequent exaltation of spirit, the ideality and romance, may\r\nwell have been Shelley\u2019s\u2014the general style of execution neither repeats\r\nnor resembles him.\r\n\r\nMary Shelley\u2019s voice, then, is not to die away as a mere echo of her\r\nillustrious husband\u2019s. She has the _prima facie_ claim to a hearing due\r\nto every writer who can assert the possession of a distinctive\r\nindividuality; and if originality be once conceded to _Frankenstein_, as\r\nin all equity it must, none will dispute the validity of a title to fame\r\ngrounded on such a work. It has solved the question itself\u2014it is famous.\r\nIt is full of faults venial in an author of nineteen; but, apart from\r\nthe wild grandeur of the conception, it has that which even the maturity\r\nof mere talent never attains\u2014the insight of genius which looks below the\r\nappearances of things, and perhaps even reverses its own first\r\nconception by the discovery of some underlying truth. Mary Shelley\u2019s\r\noriginal intention was probably that which would alone have occurred to\r\nmost writers in her place. She meant to paint Frankenstein\u2019s monstrous\r\ncreation as an object of unmitigated horror. The perception that he was\r\nan object of intense compassion as well imparted a moral value to what\r\notherwise would have remained a daring flight of imagination. It has\r\ndone more: it has helped to create, if it did not itself beget, a type\r\nof personage unknown to ancient fiction. The conception of a character\r\nat once justly execrable and truly pitiable is altogether modern.\r\nRichard the Third and Caliban make some approach towards it; but the\r\nformer is too self-sufficing in his valour and his villainy to be deeply\r\npitied, and the latter too senseless and brutal. Victor Hugo has made\r\nhimself the laureate of pathetic deformity, but much of his work is a\r\nconscious or unconscious variation on the original theme of\r\n_Frankenstein_.\r\n\r\nNone of Mary Shelley\u2019s subsequent romances approached _Frankenstein_ in\r\npower and popularity. The reason may be summed up in a word\u2014Languor.\r\nAfter the death of her infant son in 1819, she could never again command\r\nthe energy which had carried her so vigorously through _Frankenstein_.\r\nExcept in one instance, her work did not really interest her. Her heart\r\nis not in it. _Valperga_ contains many passages of exquisite beauty; but\r\nit was, as the authoress herself says, \u201ca child of mighty slow growth;\u201d\r\n\u201claboriously dug,\u201d Shelley adds, \u201cout of a hundred old chronicles,\u201d and\r\nwants the fire of imagination which alone could have interpenetrated the\r\nmass and fused its diverse ingredients into a satisfying whole. Of the\r\nlater novels, _The Last Man_ excepted, it is needless to speak, save for\r\nthe autobiographic interest with which Professor Dowden\u2019s fortunate\r\ndiscovery has informed the hitherto slighted pages of _Lodore_. But _The\r\nLast Man_ demands great attention, for it is not only a work of far\r\nhigher merit than commonly admitted, but of all her works the most\r\ncharacteristic of the authoress, the most representative of Mary Shelley\r\nin the character of pining widowhood which it was her destiny to support\r\nfor the remainder of her life. It is an idealized version of her sorrows\r\nand sufferings, made to contribute a note to the strain which celebrates\r\nthe final dissolution of the world. The languor which mars her other\r\nwritings is a beauty here, harmonizing with the general tone of sublime\r\nmelancholy. Most pictures of the end of the world, painted or penned,\r\nhave an apocalyptic character. Men\u2019s imaginations are powerfully\r\nimpressed by great convulsions of nature; fire, tempest, and earthquake\r\nare summoned to effect the dissolution of the expiring earth. In _The\r\nLast Man_ pestilence is the sole agent, and the tragedy is purely human.\r\nThe tale consequently lacks the magnificence which the subject might\r\nhave seemed to invite, but, on the other hand, gains in pathos\u2014a pathos\r\ngreatly increased when the authoress\u2019s identity is recollected, and it\r\nis observed how vividly actual experience traverses her web of fiction.\r\nNone can have been affected by Mary Shelley\u2019s work so deeply as Mary\r\nShelley herself; for the scenery is that of her familiar haunts, the\r\npersonages are her intimates under thin disguises, the universal\r\ncatastrophe is but the magnified image of the overthrow of her own\r\nfortunes; and there are pages on pages where every word must have come\r\nto her fraught with some unutterably sweet or bitter association. Yet,\r\nthough her romance could never be to the public what it was to the\r\nauthor, it is surprising that criticism should have hitherto done so\r\nlittle justice either to its pervading nobility of thought or to the\r\neloquence and beauty of very many inspired passages.\r\n\r\nWhen _The Last Man_ is reprinted it will come before the world as a new\r\nwork. The same is the case with the short tales in this collection, the\r\nvery existence of which is probably unknown to those most deeply\r\ninterested in Mary Shelley. The entire class of literature to which they\r\nbelong has long ago gone into Time\u2019s wallet as \u201calms for oblivion.\u201d They\r\nare exclusively contributions to a form of publication utterly\r\nsuperseded in this hasty age\u2014the Annual, whose very name seemed to\r\nprophesy that it would not be perennial. For the creations of the\r\nintellect, however, there is a way back from Avernus. Every new\r\ngeneration convicts the last of undue precipitation in discarding the\r\nwork of its own immediate predecessor. The special literary form may be\r\nincapable of revival; but the substance of that which has pleased or\r\nprofited its age, be it Crashaw\u2019s verse, or Etherege\u2019s comedies, or\r\nHoadly\u2019s pamphlets, or what it may, always repays a fresh examination,\r\nand is always found to contribute some element useful or acceptable to\r\nthe literature of a later day. The day of the \u201csplendid annual\u201d was\r\ncertainly not a vigorous or healthy one in the history of English\r\n_belles-lettres_. It came in at the ebb of the great tide of poetry\r\nwhich followed on the French Revolution, and before the insetting of the\r\ngreat tide of Victorian prose. A pretentious feebleness characterizes\r\nthe majority of its productions, half of which are hardly above the\r\nlevel of the album. Yet it had its good points, worthy to be taken into\r\naccount. The necessary brevity of contributions to an annual operated as\r\na powerful check on the loquacity so unfortunately encouraged by the\r\nthree-volume novel. There was no room for tiresome descriptions of\r\nminuti\u00e6, or interminable talk about uninteresting people. Being,\r\nmoreover, largely intended for the perusal of high-born maidens in\r\npalace towers, the annuals frequently affected an exalted order of\r\nsentiment, which, if intolerable in insincere or merely mechanical\r\nhands, encouraged the emotion of a really passionate writer as much as\r\nthe present taste for minute delineation represses it. This perfectly\r\nsuited Mary Shelley. No writer felt less call to reproduce the society\r\naround her. It did not interest her in the smallest degree. The bent of\r\nher soul was entirely towards the ideal. This ideal was by no means\r\nburied in the grave of Shelley. She aspired passionately towards an\r\nimaginary perfection all her life, and solaced disappointment with what,\r\nin actual existence, too often proved the parent of fresh disillusion.\r\nIn fiction it was otherwise; the fashionable style of publication, with\r\nall its faults, encouraged the enthusiasm, rapturous or melancholy, with\r\nwhich she adored the present or lamented the lost. She could fully\r\nindulge her taste for exalted sentiment in the Annual, and the necessary\r\nlimitations of space afforded less scope for that creeping languor which\r\nrelaxed the nerve of her more ambitious productions. In these little\r\ntales she is her perfect self, and the reader will find not only the\r\nentertainment of interesting fiction, but a fair picture of the mind,\r\nrepressed in its energies by circumstances, but naturally enthusiastic\r\nand aspiring, of a lonely, thwarted, misunderstood woman, who could\r\nseldom do herself justice, and whose precise place in the contemporary\r\nconstellation of genius remains to be determined.\r\n\r\nThe merit of a collection of stories, casually written at different\r\nperiods and under different influences, must necessarily be various. As\r\na rule, it may be said that Mary Shelley is best when most ideal, and\r\nexcels in proportion to the exaltation of the sentiment embodied in her\r\ntale. Virtue, patriotism, disinterested affection, are very real things\r\nto her; and her heroes and heroines, if generally above the ordinary\r\nplane of humanity, never transgress the limits of humanity itself. Her\r\nfault is the other way, and arises from a positive incapacity for\r\npainting the ugly and the commonplace. She does her best, but her\r\nvillains do not impress us. Minute delineation of character is never\r\nattempted; it lay entirely out of her sphere. Her tales are consequently\r\nexecuted in the free, broad style of the eighteenth century, towards\r\nwhich a reaction is now fortunately observable. As stories, they are\r\nvery good. The theme is always interesting, and the sequence of events\r\nnatural. No person and no incident, perhaps, takes a very strong hold\r\nupon the imagination; but the general impression is one of a sphere of\r\nexalted feeling into which it is good to enter, and which ennobles as\r\nmuch as the photography of ugliness degrades. The diction, as usual in\r\nthe imaginative literature of the period, is frequently too ornate, and\r\ncould spare a good many adjectives. But its native strength is revealed\r\nin passages of impassioned feeling; and remarkable command over the\r\nresources of the language is displayed in descriptions of scenes of\r\nnatural beauty. The microscopic touch of a Browning or a Meredith,\r\nbringing the scene vividly before the mind\u2019s eye, is indeed absolutely\r\nwanting; but the landscape is suffused with the poetical atmosphere of a\r\nClaude or a Danby. The description at the beginning of _The Sisters of\r\nAlbano_ is a characteristic and beautiful instance.\r\n\r\nThe biographical element is deeply interwoven with these as with all\r\nMary Shelley\u2019s writings. It is of especial interest to search out the\r\ntraces of her own history, and the sources from which her descriptions\r\nand ideas may have been derived. _The Mourner_ has evident vestiges of\r\nher residence near Windsor when _Alastor_ was written, and probably\r\nreflects the general impression derived from Shelley\u2019s recollections of\r\nEton. The visit to P\u00e6stum in _The Pole_ recalls one of the most\r\nbeautiful of Shelley\u2019s letters, which Mary, however, probably never saw.\r\nClaire Clairmont\u2019s fortunes seem glanced at in one or two places; and\r\nthe story of _The Pole_ may be partly founded on some experience of hers\r\nin Russia. Trelawny probably suggested the subjects of the two Greek\r\ntales, _The Evil Eye_, and _Euphrasia. The Mortal Immortal_ is a\r\nvariation on the theme of _St. Leon_, and _Transformation_ on that of\r\n_Frankenstein_. These are the only tales in the collection which betray\r\nthe influence of Godwin, and neither is so fully worked out as it might\r\nhave been. Mary Shelley was evidently more at home with a human than\r\nwith a superhuman ideal; her enthusiasm soars high, but does not\r\ntranscend the possibilities of human nature. The artistic merit of her\r\ntales will be diversely estimated, but no reader will refuse the\r\nauthoress facility of invention, or command of language, or elevation of\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n                                -------\r\n\r\n\r\n                   I.

The spring had nearly grown into summer, the trees were\r\nall in full but fresh green foliage, the vine-dresser was singing,\r\nperched among them, training his vines: the cicada had not yet begun her\r\nsong, the heats therefore had not commenced; but at evening the\r\nfire-flies gleamed among the hills, and the cooing aziola assured us of\r\nwhat in that country needs no assurance\u2014fine weather for the morrow. We\r\nset out early in the morning to avoid the heats, breakfasted at Albano,\r\nand till ten o\u2019clock passed our time in visiting the Mosaic, the villa\r\nof Cicero, and other curiosities of the place. We reposed during the\r\nmiddle of the day in a tent elevated for us at the hill-top, whence we\r\nlooked on the hill-embosomed lake, and the distant eminence crowned by a\r\ntown with its church. Other villages and cottages were scattered among\r\nthe foldings of mountains, and beyond we saw the deep blue sea of the\r\nsouthern poets, which received the swift and immortal Tiber, rocking it\r\nto repose among its devouring waves. The Coliseum falls and the Pantheon\r\ndecays,\u2014the very hills of Rome are perishing,\u2014but the Tiber lives for\r\never, flows for ever, and for ever feeds the land-encircled\r\nMediterranean with fresh waters.\r\n\r\nOur summer and pleasure-seeking party consisted of many: to me the most\r\ninteresting person was the Countess Atanasia D\u2014\u2014, who was as beautiful\r\nas an imagination of Raphael, and good as the ideal of a poet. Two of\r\nher children accompanied her, with animated looks and gentle manners,\r\nquiet, yet enjoying. I sat near her, watching the changing shadows of\r\nthe landscape before us. As the sun descended, it poured a tide of light\r\ninto the valley of the lake, deluging the deep bank formed by the\r\nmountain with liquid gold. The domes and turrets of the far town flashed\r\nand gleamed, the trees were dyed in splendour; two or three slight\r\nclouds, which had drunk the radiance till it became their essence,\r\nfloated golden islets in the lustrous empyrean. The waters, reflecting\r\nthe brilliancy of the sky and the fire-tinted banks, beamed a second\r\nheaven, a second irradiated earth, at our feet. The Mediterranean,\r\ngazing on the sun,\u2014as the eyes of a mortal bride fail and are dimmed\r\nwhen reflecting her lover\u2019s glance,\u2014was lost, mixed in his light, till\r\nit had become one with him.\u2014Long (our souls, like the sea, the hills,\r\nand lake, drinking in the supreme loveliness) we gazed, till the too\r\nfull cup overflowed, and we turned away with a sigh.\r\n\r\nAt our feet there was a knoll of ground, that formed the foreground of\r\nour picture; two trees lay basking against the sky, glittering with the\r\ngolden light, which like dew seemed to hang amid their branches; a rock\r\nclosed the prospect on the other side, twined round by creepers, and\r\nredolent with blooming myrtle; a brook, crossed by huge stones, gushed\r\nthrough the turf, and on the fragments of rock that lay about, sat two\r\nor three persons, peasants, who attracted our attention. One was a\r\nhunter, as his gun, lying on a bank not far off, demonstrated, yet he\r\nwas a tiller of the soil; his rough straw hat, and his picturesque but\r\ncoarse dress, belonged to that class. The other was some contadina, in\r\nthe costume of her country, returning, her basket on her arm, from the\r\nvillage to her cottage home. They were regarding the stores of a pedlar,\r\nwho with doffed hat stood near: some of these consisted of pictures and\r\nprints\u2014views of the country, and portraits of the Madonna. Our peasants\r\nregarded these with pleased attention.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne might easily make out a story for that pair,\u201d I said: \u201chis gun is a\r\nhelp to the imagination, and we may fancy him a bandit with his\r\ncontadina love, the terror of all the neighbourhood, except of her, the\r\nmost defenceless being in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou speak lightly of such a combination,\u201d said the lovely countess at\r\nmy side, \u201cas if it must not in its nature be the cause of dreadful\r\ntragedies. The mingling of love with crime is a dread conjunction, and\r\nlawless pursuits are never followed without bringing on the criminal,\r\nand all allied to him, ineffable misery. I speak with emotion, for your\r\nobservation reminds me of an unfortunate girl, now one of the Sisters of\r\nCharity in the convent of Santa Chiara at Rome, whose unhappy passion\r\nfor a man, such as you mention, spread destruction and sorrow widely\r\naround her.\u201d\r\n\r\nI entreated my lovely friend to relate the history of the nun. For a\r\nlong time she resisted my entreaties, as not willing to depress the\r\nspirit of a party of pleasure by a tale of sorrow. But I urged her, and\r\nshe yielded. Her sweet Italian phraseology now rings in my ears, and her\r\nbeautiful countenance is before me. As she spoke, the sun set, and the\r\nmoon bent her silver horn in the ebbing tide of glory he had left. The\r\nlake changed from purple to silver, and the trees, before so splendid,\r\nnow in dark masses, just reflected from their tops the mild moonlight.\r\nThe fire-flies flashed among the rocks; the bats circled round us:\r\nmeanwhile thus commenced the Countess Atanasia:\u2014\r\n\r\nThe nun of whom I speak had a sister older than herself; I can remember\r\nthem when as children they brought eggs and fruit to my father\u2019s villa.\r\nMaria and Anina were constantly together. With their large straw hats to\r\nshield them from the scorching sun, they were at work in their father\u2019s\r\n_podere_ all day, and in the evening, when Maria, who was the elder by\r\nfour years, went to the fountain for water, Anina ran at her side. Their\r\ncot\u2014the folding of the hill conceals it\u2014is at the lake-side opposite;\r\nand about a quarter of a mile up the hill is the rustic fountain of\r\nwhich I speak. Maria was serious, gentle, and considerate; Anina was a\r\nlaughing, merry little creature, with the face of a cherub. When Maria\r\nwas fifteen, their mother fell ill, and was nursed at the convent of\r\nSanta Chiara at Rome. Maria attended her, never leaving her bedside day\r\nor night. The nuns thought her an angel, she deemed them saints: her\r\nmother died, and they persuaded her to make one of them; her father\r\ncould not but acquiesce in her holy intention, and she became one of the\r\nSisters of Charity, the nun-nurses of Santa Chiara. Once or twice a year\r\nshe visited her home, gave sage and kind advice to Anina, and sometimes\r\nwept to part from her; but her piety and her active employments for the\r\nsick reconciled her to her fate. Anina was more sorry to lose her\r\nsister\u2019s society. The other girls of the village did not please her: she\r\nwas a good child, and worked hard for her father, and her sweetest\r\nrecompense was the report he made of her to Maria, and the fond praises\r\nand caresses the latter bestowed on her when they met.\r\n\r\nIt was not until she was fifteen that Anina showed any diminution of\r\naffection for her sister. Yet I cannot call it diminution, for she loved\r\nher perhaps more than ever, though her holy calling and sage lectures\r\nprevented her from reposing confidence, and made her tremble lest the\r\nnun, devoted to heaven and good works, should read in her eyes, and\r\ndisapprove of the earthly passion that occupied her. Perhaps a part of\r\nher reluctance arose from the reports that were current against her\r\nlover\u2019s character, and certainly from the disapprobation and even hatred\r\nof him that her father frequently expressed. Ill-fated Anina! I know not\r\nif in the north your peasants love as ours; but the passion of Anina was\r\nentwined with the roots of her being, it was herself: she could die, but\r\nnot cease to love. The dislike of her father for Domenico made their\r\nintercourse clandestine. He was always at the fountain to fill her\r\npitcher, and lift it on her head. He attended the same mass; and when\r\nher father went to Albano, Velletri, or Rome, he seemed to learn by\r\ninstinct the exact moment of his departure, and joined her in the\r\n_podere_, labouring with her and for her, till the old man was seen\r\ndescending the mountain-path on his return. He said he worked for a\r\ncontadino near Nemi. Anina sometimes wondered that he could spare so\r\nmuch time for her; but his excuses were plausible, and the result too\r\ndelightful not to blind the innocent girl to its obvious cause.\r\n\r\nPoor Domenico! the reports spread against him were too well founded: his\r\nsole excuse was that his father had been a robber before him, and he had\r\nspent his early years among these lawless men. He had better things in\r\nhis nature, and yearned for the peace of the guiltless. Yet he could\r\nhardly be called guilty, for no dread crime stained him. Nevertheless,\r\nhe was an outlaw and a bandit; and now that he loved Anina, these names\r\nwere the stings of an adder to pierce his soul. He would have fled from\r\nhis comrades to a far country, but Anina dwelt amid their very haunts.\r\nAt this period also the police established by the French Government,\r\nwhich then possessed Rome, made these bands more alive to the conduct of\r\ntheir members; and rumours of active measures to be taken against those\r\nwho occupied the hills near Albano, Nemi, and Velletri, caused them to\r\ndraw together in tighter bonds. Domenico would not, if he could, desert\r\nhis friends in the hour of danger.\r\n\r\nOn a _festa_ at this time\u2014it was towards the end of October\u2014Anina\r\nstrolled with her father among the villagers, who all over Italy make\r\nholiday by congregating and walking in one place. Their talk was\r\nentirely of the _ladri_ and the French, and many terrible stories were\r\nrelated of the extirpation of banditti in the kingdom of Naples, and the\r\nmode by which the French succeeded in their undertaking was minutely\r\ndescribed. The troops scoured the country, visiting one haunt of the\r\nrobbers after the other, and dislodging them, tracked them as in those\r\ncountries they hunt the wild beasts of the forest, till, drawing the\r\ncircle narrower, they enclosed them in one spot. They then drew a cordon\r\nround the place, which they guarded with the utmost vigilance,\r\nforbidding any to enter it with provisions, on pain of instant death.\r\nAnd as this menace was rigorously executed, in a short time the besieged\r\nbandits were starved into a surrender. The French troops were now daily\r\nexpected, for they had been seen at Velletri and Nemi; at the same time\r\nit was affirmed that several outlaws had taken up their abode at Rocca\r\nGiovane, a deserted village on the summit of one of these hills, and it\r\nwas supposed that they would make that place the scene of their final\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nThe next day, as Anina worked in the _podere_, a party of French horse\r\npassed by along the road that separated her garden from the lake.\r\nCuriosity made her look at them; and her beauty was too great not to\r\nattract. Their observations and address soon drove her away; for a woman\r\nin love consecrates herself to her lover, and deems the admiration of\r\nothers to be profanation. She spoke to her father of the impertinence of\r\nthese men; and he answered by rejoicing at their arrival, and the\r\ndestruction of the lawless bands that would ensue. When in the evening\r\nAnina went to the fountain, she looked timidly around, and hoped that\r\nDomenico would be at his accustomed post, for the arrival of the French\r\ndestroyed her feeling of security. She went rather later than usual, and\r\na cloudy evening made it seem already dark; the wind roared among the\r\ntrees, bending hither and thither even the stately cypresses; the waters\r\nof the lake were agitated into high waves, and dark masses of\r\nthundercloud lowered over the hill-tops, giving a lurid tinge to the\r\nlandscape. Anina passed quickly up the mountain-path. When she came in\r\nsight of the fountain, which was rudely hewn in the living rock, she saw\r\nDomenico leaning against a projection of the hill, his hat drawn over\r\nhis eyes, his _tabaro_ fallen from his shoulders, his arms folded in an\r\nattitude of dejection. He started when he saw her; his voice and phrases\r\nwere broken and unconnected; yet he never gazed on her with such ardent\r\nlove, nor solicited her to delay her departure with such impassioned\r\ntenderness.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow glad I am to find you here!\u201d she said; \u201cI was fearful of meeting\r\none of the French soldiers: I dread them even more than the banditti.\u201d\r\n\r\nDomenico cast a look of eager inquiry on her, and then turned away,\r\nsaying, \u201cSorry am I that I shall not be here to protect you. I am\r\nobliged to go to Rome for a week or two. You will be faithful, Anina\r\nmia; you will love me, though I never see you more?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe interview, under these circumstances, was longer than usual. He led\r\nher down the path till they nearly came in sight of her cottage; still\r\nthey lingered. A low whistle was heard among the myrtle underwood at the\r\nlake-side; he started; it was repeated; and he answered it by a similar\r\nnote. Anina, terrified, was about to ask what this meant, when, for the\r\nfirst time, he pressed her to his heart, kissed her roseate lips, and,\r\nwith a muttered \u201cCarissima addio,\u201d left her, springing down the bank;\r\nand as she gazed in wonder, she thought she saw a boat cross a line of\r\nlight made by the opening of a cloud. She stood long absorbed in\r\nreverie, wondering and remembering with thrilling pleasure the quick\r\nembrace and impassioned farewell of her lover. She delayed so long that\r\nher father came to seek her.\r\n\r\nEach evening after this, Anina visited the fountain at the Ave Maria; he\r\nwas not there: each day seemed an age; and incomprehensible fears\r\noccupied her heart. About a fortnight after, letters arrived from Maria.\r\nThey came to say that she had been ill of the malaria fever, that she\r\nwas now convalescent, but that change of air was necessary for her\r\nrecovery, and that she had obtained leave to spend a month at home at\r\nAlbano. She asked her father to come the next day to fetch her. These\r\nwere pleasant tidings for Anina; she resolved to disclose everything to\r\nher sister, and during her long visit she doubted not but that she would\r\ncontrive her happiness. Old Andrea departed the following morning, and\r\nthe whole day was spent by the sweet girl in dreams of future bliss. In\r\nthe evening Maria arrived, weak and wan, with all the marks of that\r\ndread illness about her, yet, as she assured her sister, feeling quite\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nAs they sat at their frugal supper, several villagers came in to inquire\r\nfor Maria; but all their talk was of the French soldiers and the\r\nrobbers, of whom a band of at least twenty was collected in Rocca\r\nGiovane, strictly watched by the military.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe may be grateful to the French,\u201d said Andrea, \u201cfor this good deed;\r\nthe country will be rid of these ruffians.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue, friend,\u201d said another; \u201cbut it is horrible to think what these\r\nmen suffer: they have, it appears, exhausted all the food they brought\r\nwith them to the village, and are literally starving. They have not an\r\nounce of maccaroni among them; and a poor fellow who was taken and\r\nexecuted yesterday was a mere anatomy: you could tell every bone in his\r\nskin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was a sad story the other day,\u201d said another, \u201cof an old man from\r\nNemi, whose son, they say, is among them at Rocca Giovane: he was found\r\nwithin the lines with some _baccall\u00e0_ under his _pastrano_, and shot on\r\nthe spot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is not a more desperate gang,\u201d observed the first speaker, \u201cin\r\nthe states and the _regno_ put together. They have sworn never to yield\r\nbut upon good terms. To secure these, their plan is to waylay passengers\r\nand make prisoners, whom they keep as hostages for mild treatment from\r\nthe Government. But the French are merciless; they are better pleased\r\nthat the bandits wreak their vengeance on these poor creatures than\r\nspare one of their lives.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have captured two persons already,\u201d said another; \u201cand there is\r\nold Betta Tossi half frantic, for she is sure her son is taken: he has\r\nnot been at home these ten days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should rather guess,\u201d said an old man, \u201cthat he went there with\r\ngood-will: the young scapegrace kept company with Domenico Baldi of\r\nNemi.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo worse company could he have kept in the whole country,\u201d said Andrea;\r\n\u201cDomenico is the bad son of a bad race. Is he in the village with the\r\nrest?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy own eyes assured me of that,\u201d replied the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I was up the hill with eggs and fowls to the piquette there, I saw\r\nthe branches of an ilex move; the poor fellow was weak perhaps, and\r\ncould not keep his hold; presently he dropped to the ground; every\r\nmusket was levelled at him, but he started up and was away like a hare\r\namong the rocks. Once he turned, and then I saw Domenico as plainly,\r\nthough thinner, poor lad, by much than he was,\u2014as plainly as I now\r\nsee\u2014Santa Virgine! what is the matter with Nina?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe had fainted. The company broke up, and she was left to her sister\u2019s\r\ncare. When the poor child came to herself she was fully aware of her\r\nsituation, and said nothing, except expressing a wish to retire to rest.\r\nMaria was in high spirits at the prospect of her long holiday at home;\r\nbut the illness of her sister made her refrain from talking that night,\r\nand blessing her, as she said good-night, she soon slept. Domenico\r\nstarving!\u2014Domenico trying to escape and dying through hunger, was the\r\nvision of horror that wholly possessed poor Anina. At another time, the\r\ndiscovery that her lover was a robber might have inflicted pangs as keen\r\nas those which she now felt; but this at present made a faint\r\nimpression, obscured by worse wretchedness. Maria was in a deep and\r\ntranquil sleep. Anina rose, dressed herself silently, and crept\r\ndownstairs. She stored her market-basket with what food there was in the\r\nhouse, and, unlatching the cottage-door, issued forth, resolved to reach\r\nRocca Giovane, and to administer to her lover\u2019s dreadful wants. The\r\nnight was dark, but this was favourable, for she knew every path and\r\nturn of the hills, every bush and knoll of ground between her home and\r\nthe deserted village which occupies the summit of that hill. You may see\r\nthe dark outline of some of its houses about two hours\u2019 walk from her\r\ncottage. The night was dark, but still; the _libeccio_ brought the\r\nclouds below the mountain-tops, and veiled the horizon in mist; not a\r\nleaf stirred; her footsteps sounded loud in her ears, but resolution\r\novercame fear. She had entered yon ilex grove, her spirits rose with her\r\nsuccess, when suddenly she was challenged by a sentinel; no time for\r\nescape; fear chilled her blood; her basket dropped from her arm; its\r\ncontents rolled out on the ground; the soldier fired his gun, and\r\nbrought several others round him; she was made prisoner.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, when Maria awoke she missed her sister from her side. I\r\nhave overslept myself, she thought, and Nina would not disturb me. But\r\nwhen she came downstairs and met her father, and Anina did not appear,\r\nthey began to wonder. She was not in the _podere_; two hours passed, and\r\nthen Andrea went to seek her. Entering the near village, he saw the\r\ncontadini crowding together, and a stifled exclamation of \u201cEcco il\r\npadre!\u201d told him that some evil had betided. His first impression was\r\nthat his daughter was drowned; but the truth, that she had been taken by\r\nthe French carrying provisions within the forbidden line, was still more\r\nterrible. He returned in frantic desperation to his cottage, first to\r\nacquaint Maria with what had happened, and then to ascend the hill to\r\nsave his child from her impending fate. Maria heard his tale with\r\nhorror; but an hospital is a school in which to learn self-possession\r\nand presence of mind. \u201cDo you remain, my father,\u201d she said; \u201cI will go.\r\nMy holy character will awe these men, my tears move them: trust me; I\r\nswear that I will save my sister.\u201d Andrea yielded to her superior\r\ncourage and energy.\r\n\r\nThe nuns of Santa Chiara when out of their convent do not usually wear\r\ntheir monastic habit, but dress simply in a black gown. Maria, however,\r\nhad brought her nun\u2019s habiliments with her, and, thinking thus to\r\nimpress the soldiers with respect, she now put them on. She received her\r\nfather\u2019s benediction, and, asking that of the Virgin and the saints, she\r\ndeparted on her expedition. Ascending the hill, she was soon stopped by\r\nthe sentinels. She asked to see their commanding officer, and being\r\nconducted to him, she announced herself as the sister of the unfortunate\r\ngirl who had been captured the night before. The officer, who had\r\nreceived her with carelessness, now changed countenance: his serious\r\nlook frightened Maria, who clasped her hands, exclaiming, \u201cYou have not\r\ninjured the child! she is safe!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is safe\u2014now,\u201d he replied with hesitation; \u201cbut there is no hope of\r\npardon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHoly Virgin, have mercy on her! What will be done to her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have received strict orders: in two hours she dies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! no!\u201d exclaimed Maria impetuously, \u201cthat cannot be! You cannot be so\r\nwicked as to murder a child like her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is old enough, madame,\u201d said the officer, \u201cto know that she ought\r\nnot to disobey orders; mine are so strict, that were she but nine years\r\nold, she dies.\u201d\r\n\r\nThese terrible words stung Maria to fresh resolution: she entreated for\r\nmercy; she knelt; she vowed that she would not depart without her\r\nsister; she appealed to Heaven and the saints. The officer, though\r\ncold-hearted, was good-natured and courteous, and he assured her with\r\nthe utmost gentleness that her supplications were of no avail; that were\r\nthe criminal his own daughter he must enforce his orders. As a sole\r\nconcession, he permitted her to see her sister. Despair inspired the nun\r\nwith energy; she almost ran up the hill, out-speeding her guide: they\r\ncrossed a folding of the hills to a little sheep-cot, where sentinels\r\nparaded before the door. There was no glass to the windows, so the\r\nshutters were shut; and when Maria first went in from the bright\r\ndaylight she hardly saw the slight figure of her sister leaning against\r\nthe wall, her dark hair fallen below her waist, her head sunk on her\r\nbosom, over which her arms were folded. She started wildly as the door\r\nopened, saw her sister, and sprang with a piercing shriek into her arms.\r\n\r\nThey were left alone together: Anina uttered a thousand frantic\r\nexclamations, beseeching her sister to save her, and shuddering at the\r\nnear approach of her fate. Maria had felt herself, since their mother\u2019s\r\ndeath, the natural protectress and support of her sister, and she never\r\ndeemed herself so called on to fulfil this character as now that the\r\ntrembling girl clasped her neck,\u2014her tears falling on her cheeks, and\r\nher choked voice entreating her to save her. The thought\u2014O could I\r\nsuffer instead of you! was in her heart, and she was about to express\r\nit, when it suggested another idea, on which she was resolved to act.\r\nFirst she soothed Anina by her promises, then glanced round the cot;\r\nthey were quite alone: she went to the window, and through a crevice saw\r\nthe soldiers conversing at some distance. \u201cYes, dearest sister,\u201d she\r\ncried, \u201cI will\u2014I can save you\u2014quick\u2014we must change dresses\u2014there is no\r\ntime to be lost I\u2014you must escape in my habit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you remain to die?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey dare not murder the innocent, a nun! Fear not for me\u2014I am safe.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnina easily yielded to her sister, but her fingers trembled; every\r\nstring she touched she entangled. Maria was perfectly self-possessed,\r\npale, but calm. She tied up her sister\u2019s long hair, and adjusted her\r\nveil over it so as to conceal it; she unlaced her bodice, and arranged\r\nthe folds of her own habit on her with the greatest care\u2014then more\r\nhastily she assumed the dress of her sister, putting on, after a lapse\r\nof many years, her native contadina costume. Anina stood by, weeping and\r\nhelpless, hardly hearing her sister\u2019s injunctions to return speedily to\r\ntheir father, and under his guidance to seek sanctuary. The guard now\r\nopened the door. Anina clung to her sister in terror, while she, in\r\nsoothing tones, entreated her to calm herself.\r\n\r\nThe soldier said they must delay no longer, for the priest had arrived\r\nto confess the prisoner.\r\n\r\nTo Anina the idea of confession associated with death was terrible; to\r\nMaria it brought hope. She whispered, in a smothered voice, \u201cThe priest\r\nwill protect me\u2014fear not\u2014hasten to our father!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnina almost mechanically obeyed: weeping, with her handkerchief placed\r\nunaffectedly before her face, she passed the soldiers; they closed the\r\ndoor on the prisoner, who hastened to the window, and saw her sister\r\ndescend the hill with tottering steps, till she was lost behind some\r\nrising ground. The nun fell on her knees\u2014cold dew bathed her brow,\r\ninstinctively she feared: the French had shown small respect for the\r\nmonastic character; they destroyed the convents and desecrated the\r\nchurches. Would they be merciful to her, and spare the innocent? Alas!\r\nwas not Anina innocent also? Her sole crime had been disobeying an\r\narbitrary command, and she had done the same.\r\n\r\n\u201cCourage!\u201d cried Maria; \u201cperhaps I am fitter to die than my sister is.\r\nGesu, pardon me my sins, but I do not believe that I shall out live this\r\nday!\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Anina descended the hill slowly and trembling. She\r\nfeared discovery,\u2014she feared for her sister,\u2014and above all, at the\r\npresent moment, she feared the reproaches and anger of her father. By\r\ndwelling on this last idea, it became exaggerated into excessive terror,\r\nand she determined, instead of returning to her home, to make a circuit\r\namong the hills, to find her way by herself to Albano, where she trusted\r\nto find protection from her pastor and confessor. She avoided the open\r\npaths, and following rather the direction she wished to pursue than any\r\nbeaten road, she passed along nearer to Rocca Giovane than she\r\nanticipated. She looked up at its ruined houses and bell-less steeple,\r\nstraining her eyes to catch a glimpse of him, the author of all her\r\nills. A low but distinct whistle reached her ear, not far off; she\r\nstarted,\u2014she remembered that on the night when she last saw Domenico a\r\nnote like that had called him from her side; the sound was echoed and\r\nre-echoed from other quarters; she stood aghast, her bosom heaving, her\r\nhands clasped. First she saw a dark and ragged head of hair, shadowing\r\ntwo fiercely gleaming eyes, rise from beneath a bush. She screamed, but\r\nbefore she could repeat her scream three men leapt from behind a rock,\r\nsecured her arms, threw a cloth over her face, and hurried her up the\r\nacclivity. Their talk, as she went along, informed her of the horror and\r\ndanger of her situation.\r\n\r\nPity, they said, that the holy father and some of his red stockings did\r\nnot command the troops: with a nun in their hands, they might obtain any\r\nterms. Coarse jests passed as they dragged their victim towards their\r\nruined village. The paving of the street told her when they arrived at\r\nRocca Giovane, and the change of atmosphere that they entered a house.\r\nThey unbandaged her eyes: the scene was squalid and miserable, the walls\r\nragged and black with smoke, the floor strewn with offals and dirt; a\r\nrude table and broken bench was all the furniture; and the leaves of\r\nIndian corn, heaped high in one corner, served, it seemed, for a bed,\r\nfor a man lay on it, his head buried in his folded arms. Anina looked\r\nround on her savage hosts: their countenances expressed every variety of\r\nbrutal ferocity, now rendered more dreadful from gaunt famine and\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, there is none who will save me!\u201d she cried. The voice startled the\r\nman who was lying on the floor; he lept up\u2014it was Domenico: Domenico, so\r\nchanged, with sunk cheeks and eyes, matted hair, and looks whose\r\nwildness and desperation differed little from the dark countenances\r\naround him. Could this be her lover?\r\n\r\nHis recognition and surprise at her dress led to an explanation. When\r\nthe robbers first heard that their prey was no prize, they were\r\nmortified and angry; but when she related the danger she had incurred by\r\nendeavouring to bring them food, they swore with horrid oaths that no\r\nharm should befall her, but that if she liked she might make one of them\r\nin all honour and equality. The innocent girl shuddered. \u201cLet me go,\u201d\r\nshe cried; \u201clet me only escape and hide myself in a convent for ever!\u201d\r\n\r\nDomenico looked at her in agony. \u201cYes, poor child,\u201d he said; \u201cgo save\r\nyourself: God grant no evil befall you; the ruin is too wide already.\u201d\r\nThen turning eagerly to his comrades, he continued: \u201cYou hear her story.\r\nShe was to have been shot for bringing food to us: her sister has\r\nsubstituted herself in her place. We know the French; one victim is to\r\nthem as good as another: Maria dies in their hands. Let us save her. Our\r\ntime is up; we must fall like men, or starve like dogs: we have still\r\nammunition, still some strength left. To arms! let us rush on the\r\npoltroons, free their prisoner, and escape or die!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere needed but an impulse like this to urge the outlaws to desperate\r\nresolves. They prepared their arms with looks of ferocious\r\ndetermination. Domenico, meanwhile, led Anina out of the house, to the\r\nverge of the hill, inquiring whether she intended to go. On her saying\r\nto Albano, he observed, \u201cThat were hardly safe; be guided by me, I\r\nentreat you: take these piastres, hire the first conveyance you find,\r\nhasten to Rome, to the convent of Santa Chiara: for pity\u2019s sake, do not\r\nlinger in this neighbourhood.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will obey your injunctions, Domenico,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut I cannot\r\ntake your money; it has cost you too dear: fear not, I shall arrive\r\nsafely at Rome without that ill-fated silver.\u201d\r\n\r\nDomenico\u2019s comrades now called loudly to him: he had no time to urge his\r\nrequest; he threw the despised dollars at her feet.\r\n\r\n\u201cNina, adieu for ever,\u201d he said: \u201cmay you love again more happily!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever!\u201d she replied. \u201cGod has saved me in this dress; it were sacrilege\r\nto change it: I shall never quit Santa Chiara.\u201d\r\n\r\nDomenico had led her a part of the way down the rock; his comrades\r\nappeared at the top, calling to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cGesu save you!\u201d cried he: \u201creach the convent\u2014Maria shall join you there\r\nbefore night. Farewell!\u201d He hastily kissed her hand, and sprang up the\r\nacclivity to rejoin his impatient friends.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Andrea had waited long for the return of his children.\r\nThe leafless trees and bright clear atmosphere permitted every object to\r\nbe visible, but he saw no trace of them on the hill-side; the shadows of\r\nthe dial showed noon to be passed, when, with uncontrollable impatience,\r\nhe began to climb the hill, towards the spot where Anina had been taken.\r\nThe path he pursued was in part the same that this unhappy girl had\r\ntaken on her way to Rome. The father and daughter met: the old man saw\r\nthe nun\u2019s dress, and saw her unaccompanied: she covered her face with\r\nher hands in a transport of fear and shame; but when, mistaking her for\r\nMaria, he asked in a tone of anguish for his youngest darling, her arms\r\nfell\u2014she dared not raise her eyes, which streamed with tears.\r\n\r\n\u201cUnhappy girl!\u201d exclaimed Andrea, \u201cwhere is your sister?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the cottage prison, now discernible near the summit of a\r\nsteep acclivity. \u201cShe is safe,\u201d she replied: \u201cshe saved me; but they\r\ndare not murder her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHeaven bless her for this good deed!\u201d exclaimed the old man fervently;\r\n\u201cbut you hasten on your way, and I will go in search of her.\u201d\r\n\r\nEach proceeded on an opposite path. The old man wound up the hill, now\r\nin view, and now losing sight of the hut where his child was captive: he\r\nwas aged, and the way was steep. Once, when the closing of the hill hid\r\nthe point towards which he for ever strained his eyes, a single shot was\r\nfired in that direction: his staff fell from his hands, his knees\r\ntrembled and failed him; several minutes of dead silence elapsed before\r\nhe recovered himself sufficiently to proceed: full of fears he went on,\r\nand at the next turn saw the cot again. A party of soldiers were on the\r\nopen space before it, drawn up in a line as if expecting an attack. In a\r\nfew moments from above them shots were fired, which they returned, and\r\nthe whole was enveloped and veiled in smoke. Still Andrea climbed the\r\nhill, eager to discover what had become of his child: the firing\r\ncontinued quick and hot. Now and then, in the pauses of musketry and the\r\nanswering echoes of the mountains, he heard a funeral chant; presently,\r\nbefore he was aware, at a turning of the hill, he met a company of\r\npriests and contadini, carrying a large cross and a bier. The miserable\r\nfather rushed forward with frantic impatience; the awe-struck peasants\r\nset down their load\u2014the face was uncovered, and the wretched man fell\r\nhelpless on the corpse of his murdered child.\r\n\r\nThe Countess Atanasia paused, overcome by the emotions inspired by the\r\nhistory she related. A long pause ensued: at length one of the party\r\nobserved, \u201cMaria, then, was the sacrifice to her goodness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe French,\u201d said the countess, \u201cdid not venerate her holy vocation;\r\none peasant girl to them was the same as another. The immolation of any\r\nvictim suited their purpose of awe-striking the peasantry. Scarcely,\r\nhowever, had the shot entered her heart, and her blameless spirit been\r\nreceived by the saints in Paradise, when Domenico and his followers\r\nrushed down the hill to avenge her and themselves. The contest was\r\nfurious and bloody; twenty French soldiers fell, and not one of the\r\nbanditti escaped,\u2014Domenico, the foremost of the assailants, being the\r\nfirst to fall.\u201d\r\n\r\nI asked, \u201cAnd where are now Anina and her father?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may see them, if you will,\u201d said the countess, \u201con your return to\r\nRome. She is a nun of Santa Chiara. Constant acts of benevolence and\r\npiety have inspired her with calm and resignation. Her prayers are daily\r\nput up for Domenico\u2019s soul, and she hopes, through the intercession of\r\nthe Virgin, to rejoin him in the other world.\r\n\r\n\u201cAndrea is very old; he has outlived the memory of his sufferings; but\r\nhe derives comfort from the filial attentions of his surviving daughter.\r\nBut when I look at his cottage on this lake, and remember the happy\r\nlaughing face of Anina among the vines, I shudder at the recollection of\r\nthe passion that has made her cheeks pale, her thoughts for ever\r\nconversant with death, her only wish to find repose in the grave.\u201d\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\n                          _FERDINANDO EBOLI._\r\n\r\n\r\nDURING this quiet time of peace we are fast forgetting the exciting and\r\nastonishing events of the Napoleonic wars; and the very names of\r\nEurope\u2019s conquerors are becoming antiquated to the ears of our children.\r\nThose were more romantic days than these; for the revulsions occasioned\r\nby revolution or invasion were full of romance; and travellers in those\r\ncountries in which these scenes had place hear strange and wonderful\r\nstories, whose truth so much resembles fiction, that, while interested\r\nin the narration, we never give implicit credence to the narrator. Of\r\nthis kind is a tale I heard at Naples. The fortunes of war perhaps did\r\nnot influence its actors, yet it appears improbable that any\r\ncircumstances so out of the usual routine could have had place under the\r\ngarish daylight that peace sheds upon the world.\r\n\r\nWhen Murat, then called Gioacchino, king of Naples, raised his Italian\r\nregiments, several young nobles, who had before been scarcely more than\r\nvine-dressers on the soil, were inspired with a love of arms, and\r\npresented themselves as candidates for military honours. Among these was\r\nthe young Count Eboli. The father of this youthful noble had followed\r\nFerdinand to Sicily; but his estates lay principally near Salerno, and\r\nhe was naturally desirous of preserving them; while the hopes that the\r\nFrench government held out of glory and prosperity to his country made\r\nhim often regret that he had followed his legitimate but imbecile king\r\nto exile. When he died, therefore, he recommended his son to return to\r\nNaples, to present himself to his old and tried friend, the Marchese\r\nSpina, who held a high office in Murat\u2019s government, and through his\r\nmeans to reconcile himself to the new king. All this was easily\r\nachieved. The young and gallant Count was permitted to possess his\r\npatrimony; and, as a further pledge of good fortune, he was betrothed to\r\nthe only child of the Marchese Spina. The nuptials were deferred till\r\nthe end of the ensuing campaign.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the army was put in motion, and Count Eboli only obtained such\r\nshort leave of absence as permitted him to visit for a few hours the\r\nvilla of his future father-in-law, there to take leave of him and his\r\naffianced bride. The villa was situated on one of the Apennines to the\r\nnorth of Salerno, and looked down, over the plain of Calabria, in which\r\nP\u00e6stum is situated, on to the blue Mediterranean. A precipice on one\r\nside, a brawling mountain torrent, and a thick grove of ilex, added\r\nbeauty to the sublimity of its site. Count Eboli ascended the\r\nmountain-path in all the joy of youth and hope. His stay was brief. An\r\nexhortation and a blessing from the Marchese, a tender farewell, graced\r\nby gentle tears, from the fair Adalinda, were the recollections he was\r\nto bear with him, to inspire him with courage and hope in danger and\r\nabsence. The sun had just sunk behind the distant isle of Istria, when,\r\nkissing his lady\u2019s hand, he said a last \u201cAddio,\u201d and with slower steps,\r\nand more melancholy mien, rode down the mountain on his road to Naples.\r\n\r\nThat same night Adalinda retired early to her apartment, dismissing her\r\nattendants; and then, restless from mingled fear and hope, she threw\r\nopen the glass-door that led to a balcony looking over the edge of the\r\nhill upon the torrent, whose loud rushing often lulled her to sleep, but\r\nwhose waters were concealed from sight by the ilex trees, which lifted\r\ntheir topmost branches above the guarding parapet of the balcony.\r\n\r\nLeaning her cheek upon her hand, she thought of the dangers her lover\r\nwould encounter, of her loneliness the while, of his letters, and of his\r\nreturn. A rustling sound now caught her ear. Was it the breeze among the\r\nilex trees? Her own veil was unwaved by every wind, her tresses even,\r\nheavy in their own rich beauty only, were not lifted from her cheek.\r\nAgain those sounds. Her blood retreated to her heart, and her limbs\r\ntrembled. What could it mean? Suddenly the upper branches of the nearest\r\ntree were disturbed; they opened, and the faint starlight showed a man\u2019s\r\nfigure among them. He prepared to spring from his hold on to the wall.\r\nIt was a feat of peril. First the soft voice of her lover bade her \u201cFear\r\nnot,\u201d and on the next instant he was at her side, calming her terrors,\r\nand recalling her spirits, that almost left her gentle frame, from\r\nmingled surprise, dread, and joy. He encircled her waist with his arm,\r\nand pouring forth a thousand passionate expressions of love, she leant\r\non his shoulder, and wept from agitation, while he covered her hands\r\nwith kisses, and gazed on her with ardent adoration.\r\n\r\nThen in calmer mood they sat together; triumph and joy lighted up his\r\neyes, and a modest blush glowed on her cheek: for never before had she\r\nsat alone with him, nor heard unrestrained his impassioned assurances of\r\naffection. It was, indeed, Love\u2019s own hour. The stars trembled on the\r\nroof of his eternal temple; the dashing of the torrent, the mild summer\r\natmosphere, and the mysterious aspect of the darkened scenery, were all\r\nin unison to inspire security and voluptuous hope. They talked of how\r\ntheir hearts, through the medium of divine nature, might hold commune\r\nduring absence; of the joys of reunion, and of their prospect of perfect\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nThe moment at last arrived when he must depart. \u201cOne tress of this\r\nsilken hair,\u201d said he, raising one of the many curls that clustered on\r\nher neck. \u201cI will place it on my heart, a shield to protect me against\r\nthe swords and balls of the enemy.\u201d He drew his keen-edged dagger from\r\nits sheath. \u201cIll weapon for so gentle a deed,\u201d he said, severing the\r\nlock, and at the same moment many drops of blood fell fast on the fair\r\narm of the lady. He answered her fearful inquiries by showing a gash he\r\nhad awkwardly inflicted on his left hand. First he insisted on securing\r\nhis prize, and then he permitted her to bind his wound, which she did\r\nhalf laughing, half in sorrow, winding round his hand a riband loosened\r\nfrom her own arm. \u201cNow, farewell,\u201d he cried; \u201cI must ride twenty miles\r\nere dawn, and the descending Bear shows that midnight is past.\u201d His\r\ndescent was difficult, but he achieved it happily, and the stave of a\r\nsong\u2014whose soft sounds rose like the smoke of incense from an altar\u2014from\r\nthe dell below, to her impatient ear, assured her of his safety.\r\n\r\nAs is always the case when an account is gathered from eye-witnesses, I\r\nnever could ascertain the exact date of these events. They occurred,\r\nhowever, while Murat was king of Naples; and when he raised his Italian\r\nregiments, Count Eboli, as aforesaid, became a junior officer in them,\r\nand served with much distinction, though I cannot name either the\r\ncountry or the battle in which he acted so conspicuous a part that he\r\nwas on the spot promoted to a troop.\r\n\r\nNot long after this event, and while he was stationed in the north of\r\nItaly, Gioacchino, sending for him to headquarters late one evening,\r\nentrusted him with a confidential mission, across a country occupied by\r\nthe enemy\u2019s troops, to a town possessed by the French. It was necessary\r\nto undertake the expedition during the night, and he was expected to\r\nreturn on that succeeding the following day. The king himself gave him\r\nhis despatches and the word; and the noble youth, with modest firmness,\r\nprotested that he would succeed, or die, in the fulfilment of his trust.\r\n\r\nIt was already night, and the crescent moon was low in the west, when\r\nCount Ferdinando Eboli, mounting his favourite horse, at a quick gallop\r\ncleared the streets of the town; and then, following the directions\r\ngiven him, crossed the country among the fields planted with vines,\r\ncarefully avoiding the main road. It was a beauteous and still night;\r\ncalm and sleep occupied the earth; war, the blood-hound, slumbered; the\r\nspirit of love alone had life at that silent hour. Exulting in the hope\r\nof glory, our young hero commenced his journey, and visions of\r\naggrandizement and love formed his reveries. A distant sound roused him:\r\nhe checked his horse and listened; voices approached. When recognising\r\nthe speech of a German, he turned from the path he was following, to a\r\nstill straighter way. But again the tone of an enemy was heard, and the\r\ntrampling of horses. Eboli did not hesitate; he dismounted, tied his\r\nsteed to a tree, and, skirting along the enclosure of the field, trusted\r\nto escape thus unobserved. He succeeded after an hour\u2019s painful\r\nprogress, and arrived on the borders of a stream, which, as the boundary\r\nbetween two states, was the mark of his having finally escaped danger.\r\nDescending the steep bank of the river, which, with his horse, he might\r\nperhaps have forded, he now prepared to swim. He held his despatch in\r\none hand, threw away his cloak, and was about to plunge into the water,\r\nwhen from under the dark shade of the _argine_, which had concealed\r\nthem, he was suddenly arrested by unseen hands, cast on the ground,\r\nbound, gagged, and blinded, and then placed into a little boat, which\r\nwas sculled with infinite rapidity down the stream.\r\n\r\nThere seemed so much of premeditation in the act that it baffled\r\nconjecture, yet he must believe himself a prisoner to the Austrian.\r\nWhile, however, he still vainly reflected, the boat was moored, he was\r\nlifted out, and the change of atmosphere made him aware that they\r\nentered some house. With extreme care and celerity, yet in the utmost\r\nsilence, he was stripped of his clothes, and two rings he wore drawn\r\nfrom his fingers; other habiliments were thrown over him; and then no\r\ndeparting footstep was audible; but soon he heard the splash of a single\r\noar, and he felt himself alone. He lay perfectly unable to move, the\r\nonly relief his captor or captors had afforded him being the exchange of\r\nthe gag for a tightly-bound handkerchief. For hours he thus remained,\r\nwith a tortured mind, bursting with rage, impatience, and\r\ndisappointment; now writhing as well as he could in his endeavours to\r\nfree himself, now still in despair. His despatches were taken away, and\r\nthe period was swiftly passing when he could by his presence have\r\nremedied in some degree this evil. The morning dawned, and, though the\r\nfull glare of the sun could not visit his eyes, he felt it play upon his\r\nlimbs. As the day advanced, hunger preyed on him, and, though amidst the\r\nvisitation of mightier, he at first disdained this minor, evil, towards\r\nevening it became, in spite of himself, the predominant sensation. Night\r\napproached, and the fear that he should remain, and even starve, in this\r\nunvisited solitude had more than once thrilled through his frame, when\r\nfeminine voices and a child\u2019s gay laugh met his ear. He heard persons\r\nenter the apartment, and he was asked in his native language, while the\r\nligature was taken from his mouth, the cause of his present situation.\r\nHe attributed it to banditti. His bonds were quickly cut, and his banded\r\neyes restored to sight. It was long before he recovered himself. Water\r\nbrought from the stream, however, was some refreshment, and by degrees\r\nhe resumed the use of his senses, and saw that he was in a dilapidated\r\nshepherd\u2019s cot, with no one near him save the peasant girl and a child,\r\nwho had liberated him. They rubbed his ankles and wrists, and the little\r\nfellow offered him some bread and eggs, after which refreshment and an\r\nhour\u2019s repose Ferdinando felt himself sufficiently restored to revolve\r\nhis adventure in his mind, and to determine on the conduct he was to\r\npursue.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the dress which had been given him in exchange for that\r\nwhich he had worn. It was of the plainest and meanest description. Still\r\nno time was to be lost; and he felt assured that the only step he could\r\ntake was to return with all speed to the headquarters of the Neapolitan\r\narmy, and inform the king of his disasters and his loss.\r\n\r\nIt were long to follow his backward steps, and to tell all of\r\nindignation and disappointment that swelled his heart. He walked\r\npainfully but resolutely all night, and by three in the morning entered\r\nthe town where Gioacchino then was. He was challenged by the sentinels;\r\nhe gave the word confided to him by Murat, and was instantly made\r\nprisoner by the soldiers. He declared to them his name and rank, and the\r\nnecessity he was under of immediately seeing the king. He was taken to\r\nthe guard-house, and the officer on duty there listened with contempt to\r\nhis representations, telling him that Count Ferdinando Eboli had\r\nreturned three hours before, ordering him to be confined for further\r\nexamination as a spy. Eboli loudly insisted that some impostor had taken\r\nhis name; and while he related the story of his capture, another officer\r\ncame in, who recognised his person; other individuals acquainted with\r\nhim joined the party; and as the impostor had been seen by none but the\r\nofficer of the night, his tale gained ground.\r\n\r\nA young Frenchman of superior rank, who had orders to attend the king\r\nearly in the morning, carried a report of what was going forward to\r\nMurat himself. The tale was so strange that the king sent for the young\r\nCount; and then, in spite of having seen and believed in his counterfeit\r\na few hours before, and having received from him an account of his\r\nmission, which had been faithfully executed, the appearance of the youth\r\nstaggered him, and he commanded the presence of him who, as Count Eboli,\r\nhad appeared before him a few hours previously. As Ferdinand stood\r\nbeside the king, his eye glanced at a large and splendid mirror. His\r\nmatted hair, his bloodshot eyes, his haggard looks, and torn and mean\r\ndress, derogated from the nobility of his appearance; and still less did\r\nhe appear like the magnificent Count Eboli, when, to his utter confusion\r\nand astonishment, his counterfeit stood beside him.\r\n\r\nHe was perfect in all the outward signs that denoted high birth; and so\r\nlike him whom he represented, that it would have been impossible to\r\ndiscern one from the other apart. The same chestnut hair clustered on\r\nhis brow; the sweet and animated hazel eyes were the same; the one voice\r\nwas the echo of the other. The composure and dignity of the pretender\r\ngained the suffrages of those around. When he was told of the strange\r\nappearance of another Count Eboli, he laughed in a frank good-humoured\r\nmanner, and, turning to Ferdinand, said, \u201cYou honour me much in\r\nselecting me for your personation; but there are two or three things I\r\nlike about myself so well, that you must excuse my unwillingness to\r\nexchange myself for you.\u201d Ferdinand would have answered, but the false\r\nCount, with greater haughtiness, turning to the king, said, \u201cWill your\r\nmajesty decide between us? I cannot bandy words with a fellow of this\r\nsort.\u201d Irritated by scorn, Ferdinand demanded leave to challenge the\r\npretender; who said, that if the king and his brother-officers did not\r\nthink that he should degrade himself and disgrace the army by going out\r\nwith a common vagabond, he was willing to chastise him, even at the\r\nperil of his own life. But the king, after a few more questions, feeling\r\nassured that the unhappy noble was an impostor, in severe and menacing\r\nterms reprehended him for his insolence, telling him that he owed it to\r\nhis mercy alone that he was not executed as a spy, ordering him\r\ninstantly to be conducted without the walls of the town, with threats of\r\nweighty punishment if he ever dared to subject his impostures to further\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nIt requires a strong imagination, and the experience of much misery,\r\nfully to enter into Ferdinand\u2019s feelings. From high rank, glory, hope,\r\nand love, he was hurled to utter beggary and disgrace. The insulting\r\nwords of his triumphant rival, and the degrading menaces of his so\r\nlately gracious sovereign, rang in his ears; every nerve in his frame\r\nwrithed with agony. But, fortunately for the endurance of human life,\r\nthe worst misery in early youth is often but a painful dream, which we\r\ncast off when slumber quits our eyes. After a struggle with intolerable\r\nanguish, hope and courage revived in his heart. His resolution was\r\nquickly made. He would return to Naples, relate his story to the\r\nMarchese Spina, and through his influence obtain at least an impartial\r\nhearing from the king. It was not, however, in his peculiar situation,\r\nan easy task to put his determination into effect. He was penniless; his\r\ndress bespoke poverty; he had neither friend nor kinsman near, but such\r\nas would behold in him the most impudent of swindlers. Still his courage\r\ndid not fail him. The kind Italian soil, in the autumnal season now\r\nadvanced, furnished him with chestnuts, arbutus berries, and grapes. He\r\ntook the most direct road over the hills, avoiding towns, and indeed\r\nevery habitation; travelling principally in the night, when, except in\r\ncities, the officers of government had retired from their stations. How\r\nhe succeeded in getting from one end of Italy to the other it is\r\ndifficult to say; but certain it is, that, after the interval of a few\r\nweeks, he presented himself at the Villa Spina.\r\n\r\nWith considerable difficulty he obtained admission to the presence of\r\nthe Marchese, who received him standing, with an inquiring look, not at\r\nall recognising the noble youth. Ferdinand requested a private\r\ninterview, for there were several visitors present. His voice startled\r\nthe Marchese, who complied, taking him into another apartment. Here\r\nFerdinand disclosed himself, and, with rapid and agitated utterance, was\r\nrelating the history of his misfortunes, when the tramp of horses was\r\nheard, the great bell rang, and a domestic announced \u201cCount Ferdinando\r\nEboli.\u201d \u201cIt is himself,\u201d cried the youth, turning pale. The words were\r\nstrange, and they appeared still more so when the person announced\r\nentered; the perfect semblance of the young noble, whose name he\r\nassumed, as he had appeared when last at his departure, he trod the\r\npavement of the hall. He inclined his head gracefully to the baron,\r\nturning with a glance of some surprise, but more disdain, towards\r\nFerdinand, exclaiming, \u201cThou here!\u201d\r\n\r\nFerdinand drew himself up to his full height. In spite of fatigue,\r\nill-fare, and coarse garments, his manner was full of dignity. The\r\nMarchese looked at him fixedly, and started as he marked his proud mien,\r\nand saw in his expressive features the very face of Eboli. But again he\r\nwas perplexed when he turned and discerned, as in a mirror, the same\r\ncountenance reflected by the new-comer, who underwent this scrutiny\r\nsomewhat impatiently. In brief and scornful words he told the Marchese\r\nthat this was a second attempt in the intruder to impose himself as\r\nCount Eboli; that the trick had failed before, and would again; adding,\r\nlaughing, that it was hard to be brought to prove himself to be himself,\r\nagainst the assertion of a _briccone_, whose likeness to him, and\r\nmatchless impudence, were his whole stock-in-trade.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, my good fellow,\u201d continued he, sneeringly, \u201cyou put me out of\r\nconceit with myself, to think that one, apparently so like me, should\r\nget on no better in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe blood mounted into Ferdinand\u2019s cheeks on his enemy\u2019s bitter taunts;\r\nwith difficulty he restrained himself from closing with his foe, while\r\nthe words \u201ctraitorous impostor!\u201d burst from his lips. The baron\r\ncommanded the fierce youth to be silent, and, moved by a look that he\r\nremembered to be Ferdinand\u2019s, he said gently, \u201cBy your respect for me, I\r\nadjure you to be patient; fear not but that I will deal impartially.\u201d\r\nThen turning to the pretended Eboli, he added that he could not doubt\r\nbut that he was the true Count, and asked excuse for his previous\r\nindecision. At first the latter appeared angry, but at length he burst\r\ninto a laugh, and then, apologising for his ill-breeding, continued\r\nlaughing heartily at the perplexity of the Marchese. It is certain his\r\ngaiety gained more credit with his auditor than the indignant glances of\r\npoor Ferdinand. The false Count then said that, after the king\u2019s\r\nmenaces, he had entertained no expectation that the farce was to be\r\nplayed over again. He had obtained leave of absence, of which he\r\nprofited to visit his future father-in-law, after having spent a few\r\ndays in his own palazzo at Naples. Until now Ferdinand had listened\r\nsilently, with a feeling of curiosity, anxious to learn all he could of\r\nthe actions and motives of his rival; but at these last words he could\r\nno longer contain himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d cried he, \u201chast thou usurped my place in my own father\u2019s house,\r\nand dared assume my power in my ancestral halls?\u201d\r\n\r\nA gush of tears overpowered the youth; he hid his face in his hands.\r\nFierceness and pride lit up the countenance of the pretender.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the eternal God and the sacred cross, I swear,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cthat\r\npalace is my father\u2019s palace; those halls the halls of my ancestors!\u201d\r\n\r\nFerdinand looked up with surprise: \u201cAnd the earth opens not,\u201d he said,\r\n\u201cto swallow the perjured man.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe then, at the call of the Marchese, related his adventures, while\r\nscorn mantled on the features of his rival. The Marchese, looking at\r\nboth, could not free himself from doubt. He turned from one to the\r\nother: in spite of the wild and disordered appearance of poor Ferdinand,\r\nthere was something in him that forbade his friend to condemn him as the\r\nimpostor; but then it was utterly impossible to pronounce such the\r\ngallant and noble-looking youth, who could only be acknowledged as the\r\nreal Count by the disbelief of the other\u2019s tale. The Marchese, calling\r\nan attendant, sent for his fair daughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis decision,\u201d said he, \u201cshall be made over to the subtle judgment of\r\na woman, and the keen penetration of one who loves.\u201d\r\n\r\nBoth the youths now smiled\u2014the same smile; the same expression\u2014that of\r\nanticipated triumph. The baron was more perplexed than ever.\r\n\r\nAdalinda had heard of the arrival of Count Eboli, and entered,\r\nresplendent in youth and happiness. She turned quickly towards him who\r\nresembled most the person she expected to see; when a well-known voice\r\npronounced her name, and she gazed aghast on the double appearance of\r\nthe lover. Her father, taking her hand, briefly explained the mystery,\r\nand bade her assure herself which was her affianced husband.\r\n\r\n\u201cSignorina,\u201d said Ferdinand, \u201cdisdain me not because I appear before you\r\nthus in disgrace and misery. Your love, your goodness will restore me to\r\nprosperity and happiness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know not by what means,\u201d said the wondering girl, \u201cbut surely you are\r\nCount Eboli.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAdalinda,\u201d said the rival youth, \u201cwaste not your words on a villain.\r\nLovely and deceived one, I trust, trembling I say it, that I can with\r\none word assure you that I am Eboli.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAdalinda,\u201d said Ferdinand, \u201cI placed the nuptial ring on your finger;\r\nbefore God your vows were given to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe false Count approached the lady, and, bending one knee, took from\r\nhis heart a locket, enclosing hair tied with a green riband, which she\r\nrecognised to have worn, and pointed to a slight scar on his left hand.\r\n\r\nAdalinda blushed deeply, and, turning to her father, said, motioning\r\ntowards the kneeling youth,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is Ferdinand.\u201d\r\n\r\nAll protestations now from the unhappy Eboli were vain. The Marchese\r\nwould have cast him into a dungeon; but at the earnest request of his\r\nrival, he was not detained, but thrust ignominiously from the villa. The\r\nrage of a wild beast newly chained was less than the tempest of\r\nindignation that now filled the heart of Ferdinand. Physical suffering,\r\nfrom the fatigue and fasting, was added to his internal anguish; for\r\nsome hours madness, if that were madness which never forgets its ill,\r\npossessed him. In a tumult of feelings there was one predominant idea:\r\nit was to take possession of his father\u2019s house, and to try, by\r\nameliorating the fortuitous circumstances of his lot, to gain the upper\r\nhand of his adversary. He expended his remaining strength in reaching\r\nNaples, entered his family palace, and was received and acknowledged by\r\nhis astonished domestics.\r\n\r\nOne of his first acts was to take from a cabinet a miniature of his\r\nfather encircled with jewels, and to invoke the aid of the paternal\r\nspirit. Refreshment and a bath restored him to some of his usual\r\nstrength; and he looked forward with almost childish delight to one\r\nnight to be spent in peace under the roof of his father\u2019s house. This\r\nwas not permitted. Ere midnight the great bell sounded: his rival\r\nentered as master, with the Marchese Spina. The result may be divined.\r\nThe Marchese appeared more indignant than the false Eboli. He insisted\r\nthat the unfortunate youth should be imprisoned. The portrait, whose\r\nsetting was costly, found on him, proved him guilty of robbery. He was\r\ngiven into the hands of the police, and thrown into a dungeon. I will\r\nnot dwell on the subsequent scenes. He was tried by the tribunal,\r\ncondemned as guilty, and sentenced to the galleys for life.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the day when he was to be removed from the Neapolitan\r\nprison to work on the roads in Calabria, his rival visited him in his\r\ndungeon. For some moments both looked at the other in silence. The\r\nimpostor gazed on the prisoner with mingled pride and compassion: there\r\nwas evidently a struggle in his heart. The answering glance of Ferdinand\r\nwas calm, free, and dignified. He was not resigned to his hard fate, but\r\nhe disdained to make any exhibition of despair to his cruel and\r\nsuccessful foe. A spasm of pain seemed to wrench the bosom of the false\r\none; and he turned aside, striving to recover the hardness of heart\r\nwhich had hitherto supported him in the prosecution of his guilty\r\nenterprise. Ferdinand spoke first.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat would the triumphant criminal with his innocent victim?\u201d\r\n\r\nHis visitant replied haughtily, \u201cDo not address such epithets to me, or\r\nI leave you to your fate: I am that which I say I am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo me this boast!\u201d cried Ferdinand scornfully; \u201cbut perhaps these walls\r\nhave ears.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHeaven, at least, is not deaf,\u201d said the deceiver; \u201cfavouring Heaven,\r\nwhich knows and admits my claim. But a truce to this idle discussion.\r\nCompassion\u2014a distaste to see one so very like myself in such ill\r\ncondition\u2014a foolish whim, perhaps, on which you may congratulate\r\nyourself\u2014has led me hither. The bolts of your dungeon are drawn; here is\r\na purse of gold; fulfil one easy condition, and you are free.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that condition?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSign this paper.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe gave to Ferdinand a writing, containing a confession of his imputed\r\ncrimes. The hand of the guilty youth trembled as he gave it; there was\r\nconfusion in his mien, and a restless uneasy rolling of his eye.\r\nFerdinand wished in one mighty word, potent as lightning, loud as\r\nthunder, to convey his burning disdain of this proposal: but expression\r\nis weak, and calm is more full of power than storm. Without a word, he\r\ntore the paper in two pieces and threw them at the feet of his enemy.\r\n\r\nWith a sudden change of manner, his visitant conjured him, in voluble\r\nand impetuous terms, to comply. Ferdinand answered only by requesting to\r\nbe left alone. Now and then a half word broke uncontrollably from his\r\nlips; but he curbed himself. Yet he could not hide his agitation when,\r\nas an argument to make him yield, the false Count assured him that he\r\nwas already married to Adalinda. Bitter agony thrilled poor Ferdinand\u2019s\r\nframe; but he preserved a calm mien, and an unaltered resolution. Having\r\nexhausted every menace and every persuasion, his rival left him, the\r\npurpose for which he came unaccomplished. On the morrow, with many\r\nothers, the refuse of mankind, Count Ferdinando Eboli was led in chains\r\nto the unwholesome plains of Calabria, to work there at the roads.\r\n\r\nI must hurry over some of the subsequent events, for a detailed account\r\nof them would fill volumes. The assertion of the usurper of Ferdinand\u2019s\r\nright, that he was already married to Adalinda, was, like all else he\r\nsaid, false. The day was, however, fixed for their union, when the\r\nillness and the subsequent death of the Marchese Spina delayed its\r\ncelebration. Adalinda retired during the first months of mourning to a\r\ncastle belonging to her father not far from Arpino, a town of the\r\nkingdom of Naples, in the midst of the Apennines, about 50 miles from\r\nthe capital. Before she went, the deceiver tried to persuade her to\r\nconsent to a private marriage. He was probably afraid that, in the long\r\ninterval that was about to ensue before he could secure her, she would\r\ndiscover his imposture. Besides, a rumour had gone abroad that one of\r\nthe fellow-prisoners of Ferdinand, a noted bandit, had escaped, and that\r\nthe young count was his companion in flight. Adalinda, however, refused\r\nto comply with her lover\u2019s entreaties, and retired to her seclusion with\r\nan old aunt, who was blind and deaf, but an excellent duenna. The false\r\nEboli seldom visited his mistress; but he was a master in his art, and\r\nsubsequent events showed that he must have spent all his time,\r\ndisguised, in the vicinity of the castle. He contrived by various means,\r\nunsuspected at the moment, to have all Adalinda\u2019s servants changed for\r\ncreatures of his own; so that, without her being aware of the restraint,\r\nshe was, in fact, a prisoner in her own house. It is impossible to say\r\nwhat first awakened her suspicions concerning the deception put upon\r\nher. She was an Italian, with all the habitual quiescence and lassitude\r\nof her countrywomen in the ordinary routine of life, and with all their\r\nenergy and passion when roused. The moment the doubt darted into her\r\nmind she resolved to be assured. A few questions relative to scenes that\r\nhad passed between poor Ferdinand and herself sufficed for this. They\r\nwere asked so suddenly and pointedly that the pretender was thrown off\r\nhis guard; he looked confused, and stammered in his replies. Their eyes\r\nmet; he felt that he was detected, and she saw that he perceived her now\r\nconfirmed suspicions. A look such as is peculiar to an impostor\u2014a glance\r\nthat deformed his beauty, and filled his usually noble countenance with\r\nthe hideous lines of cunning and cruel triumph\u2014completed her faith in\r\nher own discernment. \u201cHow,\u201d she thought, \u201ccould I have mistaken this man\r\nfor my own gentle Eboli?\u201d Again their eyes met. The peculiar expression\r\nof his terrified her, and she hastily quitted the apartment.\r\n\r\nHer resolution was quickly formed. It was of no use to attempt to\r\nexplain her situation to her old aunt. She determined to depart\r\nimmediately for Naples, throw herself at the feet of Gioacchino, and to\r\nrelate and obtain credit for her strange history. But the time was\r\nalready lost when she could have executed this design. The contrivances\r\nof the deceiver were complete\u2014she found herself a prisoner. Excess of\r\nfear gave her boldness, if not courage. She sought her jailor. A few\r\nminutes before she had been a young and thoughtless girl, docile as a\r\nchild, and as unsuspecting; now she felt as if she had suddenly grown\r\nold in wisdom, and that the experience of years had been gained in that\r\nof a few seconds.\r\n\r\nDuring their interview she was wary and firm, while the instinctive\r\npower of innocence over guilt gave majesty to her demeanour. The\r\ncontriver of her ills for a moment cowered beneath her eye. At first he\r\nwould by no means allow that he was not the person he pretended to be,\r\nbut the energy and eloquence of truth bore down his artifice, so that,\r\nat length driven into a corner, he turned\u2014a stag at bay. Then it was her\r\nturn to quail, for the superior energy of a man gave him the mastery. He\r\ndeclared the truth: he was the elder brother of Ferdinand, a natural son\r\nof the old Count Eboli. His mother, who had been wronged, never forgave\r\nher injurer, and bred her son in deadly hate for his parent, and a\r\nbelief that the advantages enjoyed by his more fortunate brother were\r\nrightfully his own. His education was rude; but he had an Italian\u2019s\r\nsubtle talents, swiftness of perception, and guileful arts.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would blanch your cheek,\u201d he said to his trembling auditress, \u201ccould\r\nI describe all that I have suffered to achieve my purpose. I would trust\r\nto none\u2014I executed all myself. It was a glorious triumph, but due to my\r\nperseverance and my fortitude, when I and my usurping brother stood\u2014I,\r\nthe noble, he, the degraded outcast\u2014before our sovereign.\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving rapidly detailed his history, he now sought to win the favourable\r\near of Adalinda, who stood with averted and angry looks. He tried by the\r\nvaried shows of passion and tenderness to move her heart. Was he not, in\r\ntruth, the object of her love? Was it not he who scaled her balcony at\r\nVilla Spina? He recalled scenes of mutual overflow of feeling to her\r\nmind, thus urging arguments the most potent with a delicate woman. Pure\r\nblushes tinged her cheek, but horror of the deceiver predominated over\r\nevery other sentiment. He swore that as soon as they should be united he\r\nwould free Ferdinand, and bestow competency, nay, if so she willed it,\r\nhalf his possessions on him. She coldly replied, that she would rather\r\nshare the chains of the innocent, and misery, than link herself with\r\nimposture and crime. She demanded her liberty; but the untamed and even\r\nferocious nature that had borne the deceiver through his career of crime\r\nnow broke forth, and he invoked fearful imprecations on his head if she\r\never quitted the castle except as his wife. His look of conscious power\r\nand unbridled wickedness terrified her; her flashing eyes spoke\r\nabhorrence. It would have been far easier for her to have died than have\r\nyielded the smallest point to a man who had made her feel for one moment\r\nhis irresistible power, arising from her being an unprotected woman,\r\nwholly in his hands. She left him, feeling as if she had just escaped\r\nfrom the impending sword of an assassin.\r\n\r\nOne hour\u2019s deliberation suggested to her a method of escape from her\r\nterrible situation. In a wardrobe at the castle lay, in their pristine\r\ngloss, the habiliments of a page of her mother, who had died suddenly,\r\nleaving these unworn relics of his station. Dressing herself in these,\r\nshe tied up her dark shining hair, and even, with a somewhat bitter\r\nfeeling, girded on the slight sword that appertained to the costume.\r\nThen, through a private passage leading from her own apartment to the\r\nchapel of the castle, she glided with noiseless steps, long after the\r\nAve Maria, sounded at four o\u2019clock, had, on a November night, given\r\ntoken that half an hour had passed since the setting of the sun. She\r\npossessed the key of the chapel door\u2014it opened at her touch; she closed\r\nit behind her, and she was free. The pathless hills were around her, the\r\nstarry heavens above, and a cold wintry breeze murmured around the\r\ncastle walls; but fear of her enemy conquered every other fear, and she\r\ntripped lightly on in a kind of ecstasy for many a long hour over the\r\nstony mountain path\u2014she, who had never before walked more than a mile or\r\ntwo from home at any time in her life\u2014till her feet were blistered, her\r\nslight shoes cut through, her way utterly lost. At morning\u2019s dawn she\r\nfound herself in the midst of the wild ilex-covered Apennines, and\r\nneither habitation nor human being apparent.\r\n\r\nShe was hungry and weary. She had brought gold and jewels with her; but\r\nhere were no means of exchanging these for food. She remembered stories\r\nof banditti, but none could be so ruffian-like and cruel as him from\r\nwhom she fled. This thought, a little rest, and a draught of water from\r\na pure mountain-spring, restored her to some portion of courage, and she\r\ncontinued her journey. Noonday approached; and, in the south of Italy,\r\nthe noonday sun, when unclouded, even in November, is oppressively warm,\r\nespecially to an Italian woman, who never exposes herself to its beams.\r\nFaintness came over her. There appeared recesses in the mountain sides\r\nalong which she was travelling, grown over with bay and arbutus: she\r\nentered one of these, there to repose. It was deep, and led to another\r\nthat opened into a spacious cavern lighted from above: there were cates,\r\ngrapes, and a flagon of wine on a rough-hewn table. She looked fearfully\r\naround, but no inhabitant appeared. She placed herself at the table,\r\nand, half in dread, ate of the food presented to her; and then sat, her\r\nelbow on the table, her head resting on her little snow-white hand, her\r\ndark hair shading her brow and clustering round her throat. An\r\nappearance of languor and fatigue was diffused through her attitude,\r\nwhile her soft black eyes filled at intervals with large tears as,\r\npitying herself, she recurred to the cruel circumstances of her lot. Her\r\nfanciful but elegant dress, her feminine form, her beauty and her grace,\r\nas she sat pensive and alone in the rough unhewn cavern, formed a\r\npicture a poet would describe with delight, an artist love to paint.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe seemed a being of another world; a seraph, all light and beauty: a\r\nGanymede, escaped from his thrall above to his natal Ida. It was long\r\nbefore I recognised, looking down on her from the opening hill, my lost\r\nAdalinda.\u201d Thus spoke the young Count Eboli, when he related this story;\r\nfor its end was as romantic as its commencement.\r\n\r\nWhen Ferdinando had arrived, a galley-slave in Calabria, he found\r\nhimself coupled with a bandit, a brave fellow, who abhorred his chains,\r\nfrom love of freedom, as much as his fellow-prisoner did, from all the\r\ncombination of disgrace and misery they brought upon him. Together they\r\ndevised a plan of escape, and succeeded in effecting it. On their road,\r\nFerdinand related his story to the outlaw, who encouraged him to hope\r\nfor a favourable turn of fate; and meanwhile invited and persuaded the\r\ndesperate man to share his fortunes as a robber among the wild hills of\r\nCalabria.\r\n\r\nThe cavern where Adalinda had taken refuge was one of their fastnesses,\r\nwhither they betook themselves at periods of imminent danger for safety\r\nonly, as no booty could be collected in that unpeopled solitude; and\r\nthere, one afternoon, returning from the chase, they found the\r\nwandering, fearful, solitary, fugitive girl; and never was lighthouse\r\nmore welcome to tempest-tossed sailor than was her own Ferdinand to his\r\nlady-love.\r\n\r\nFortune, now tired of persecuting the young noble, favoured him still\r\nfurther. The story of the lovers interested the bandit chief, and\r\npromise of reward secured him. Ferdinand persuaded Adalinda to remain\r\none night in the cave, and on the following morning they prepared to\r\nproceed to Naples; but at the moment of their departure they were\r\nsurprised by an unexpected visitant: the robbers brought in a\r\nprisoner\u2014it was the impostor. Missing on the morrow her who was the\r\npledge of his safety and success, but assured that she could not have\r\nwandered far, he despatched emissaries in all directions to seek her;\r\nand himself, joining in the pursuit, followed the road she had taken,\r\nand was captured by these lawless men, who expected rich ransom from one\r\nwhose appearance denoted rank and wealth. When they discovered who their\r\nprisoner was, they generously delivered him up into his brother\u2019s hands.\r\n\r\nFerdinand and Adalinda proceeded to Naples. On their arrival, she\r\npresented herself to Queen Caroline; and, through her, Murat heard with\r\nastonishment the device that had been practised on him. The young Count\r\nwas restored to his honours and possessions, and within a few months\r\nafterwards was united to his betrothed bride.\r\n\r\nThe compassionate nature of the Count and Countess led them to interest\r\nthemselves warmly in the fate of Ludovico, whose subsequent career was\r\nmore honourable but less fortunate. At the intercession of his relative,\r\nGioacchino permitted him to enter the army, where he distinguished\r\nhimself, and obtained promotion. The brothers were at Moscow together,\r\nand mutually assisted each other during the horrors of the retreat. At\r\none time overcome by drowsiness, the mortal symptom resulting from\r\nexcessive cold, Ferdinand lingered behind his comrades; but Ludovico,\r\nrefusing to leave him, dragged him on in spite of himself, till,\r\nentering a village, food and fire restored him, and his life was saved.\r\nOn another evening, when wind and sleet added to the horror of their\r\nsituation, Ludovico, after many ineffective struggles, slid from his\r\nhorse lifeless; Ferdinand was at his side, and, dismounting, endeavoured\r\nby every means in his power to bring back pulsation to his stagnant\r\nblood. His comrades went forward, and the young Count was left alone\r\nwith his dying brother in the white boundless waste. Once Ludovico\r\nopened his eyes and recognised him; he pressed his hand, and his lips\r\nmoved to utter a blessing as he died. At that moment the welcome sounds\r\nof the enemy\u2019s approach roused Ferdinand from the despair into which his\r\ndreadful situation plunged him. He was taken prisoner, and his life was\r\nthus saved. When Napoleon went to Elba, he, with many others of his\r\ncountrymen, was liberated, and returned to Naples.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III.\r\n\r\n                            _THE EVIL EYE._\r\n\r\n              \u201cThe wild Albanian kirtled to his knee,\r\n                 With shawl-girt head, and ornamented gun,\r\n               And gold-embroider\u2019d garments, fair to see;\r\n                 The crimson-scarfed man of Macedon.\u201d\r\n                             \u2014LORD BYRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Moreot, Katusthius Ziani, travelled wearily, and in fear of its\r\nrobber-inhabitants, through the pashalik of Yannina; yet he had no cause\r\nfor dread. Did he arrive, tired and hungry, in a solitary village,\u2014did\r\nhe find himself in the uninhabited wilds suddenly surrounded by a band\r\nof klephts,\u2014or in the larger towns did he shrink at finding himself,\r\nsole of his race, among the savage mountaineers and despotic Turk,\u2014as\r\nsoon as he announced himself the Pobratimo[1] of Dmitri of the Evil Eye,\r\nevery hand was held out, every voice spoke welcome.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  In Greece, especially in Illyria and Epirus, it is no uncommon thing\r\n  for persons of the same sex to swear friendship. The Church contains a\r\n  ritual to consecrate this vow. Two men thus united are called\r\n  _pobratimi_, the women _posestrime_.\r\n\r\nThe Albanian, Dmitri, was a native of the village of Korvo. Among the\r\nsavage mountains of the district between Yannina and Terpellen\u00e8, the\r\ndeep broad stream of Argyro-Castro flows; bastioned to the west by\r\nabrupt wood-covered precipices, shadowed to the east by elevated\r\nmountains. The highest among these is Mount Trebucci; and in a romantic\r\nfolding of that hill, distinct with minarets, crowned by a dome rising\r\nfrom out a group of pyramidal cypresses, is the picturesque village of\r\nKorvo. Sheep and goats form the apparent treasure of its inhabitants;\r\ntheir guns and yataghans, their warlike habits, and, with them, the\r\nnoble profession of robbery, are sources of still greater wealth. Among\r\na race renowned for dauntless courage and sanguinary enterprise, Dmitri\r\nwas distinguished.\r\n\r\nIt was said that in his youth this klepht was remarkable for a gentler\r\ndisposition and more refined taste than is usual with his countrymen. He\r\nhad been a wanderer, and had learned European arts, of which he was not\r\na little proud. He could read and write Greek, and a book was often\r\nstowed beside his pistols in his girdle. He had spent several years in\r\nScio, the most civilised of the Greek islands, and had married a Sciote\r\ngirl. The Albanians are characterized as despisers of women; but Dmitri,\r\nin becoming the husband of Helena, enlisted under a more chivalrous\r\nrule, and became the proselyte of a better creed. Often he returned to\r\nhis native hills, and fought under the banner of the renowned Ali, and\r\nthen came back to his island home. The love of the tamed barbarian was\r\nconcentrated, burning, and something beyond this: it was a portion of\r\nhis living, beating heart,\u2014the nobler part of himself,\u2014the diviner mould\r\nin which his rugged nature had been recast.\r\n\r\nOn his return from one of his Albanian expeditions he found his home\r\nravaged by the Mainotes. Helena\u2014they pointed to her tomb, nor dared tell\r\nhim how she died; his only child, his lovely infant daughter, was\r\nstolen; his treasure-house of love and happiness was rifled, its\r\ngold-excelling wealth changed to blank desolation. Dmitri spent three\r\nyears in endeavours to recover his lost offspring. He was exposed to a\r\nthousand dangers, underwent incredible hardships. He dared the wild\r\nbeast in his lair, the Mainote in his port of refuge; he attacked, and\r\nwas attacked by them. He wore the badge of his daring in a deep gash\r\nacross his eyebrow and cheek. On this occasion he had died, but that\r\nKatusthius, seeing a scuffle on shore and a man left for dead,\r\ndisembarked from a Moreot sacovela, carried him away, tended and cured\r\nhim. They exchanged vows of friendship, and for some time the Albanian\r\nshared his brother\u2019s toils; but they were too pacific to suit his taste,\r\nand he returned to Korvo.\r\n\r\nWho in the mutilated savage could recognise the handsomest amongst the\r\nArnaoots? His habits kept pace with his change of physiognomy: he grew\r\nferocious and hardhearted; he only smiled when engaged in dangerous\r\nenterprise. He had arrived at that worst state of ruffian feeling, the\r\ntaking delight in blood. He grew old in these occupations; his mind\r\nbecame reckless, his countenance more dark; men trembled before his\r\nglance, women and children exclaimed in terror, \u201cThe Evil Eye!\u201d The\r\nopinion became prevalent; he shared it himself; he gloried in the dread\r\nprivilege; and when his victim shivered and withered beneath the mortal\r\ninfluence, the fiendish laugh with which he hailed this demonstration of\r\nhis power struck with worse dismay the failing heart of the fascinated\r\nperson. But Dmitri could command the arrows of his sight; and his\r\ncomrades respected him the more for his supernatural attribute since\r\nthey did not fear the exercise of it on themselves.\r\n\r\nDmitri had just returned from an expedition beyond Prevesa. He and his\r\ncomrades were laden with spoil. They killed and roasted a goat whole for\r\ntheir repast; they drank dry several wine skins; then, round the fire in\r\nthe court, they abandoned themselves to the delights of the kerchief\r\ndance, roaring out the chorus as they dropped upon and then rebounded\r\nfrom their knees, and whirled round and round with an activity all their\r\nown. The heart of Dmitri was heavy; he refused to dance, and sat apart,\r\nat first joining in the song with his voice and lute, till the air\r\nchanged to one that reminded him of better days. His voice died away,\r\nhis instrument dropped from his hands, and his head sank upon his\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of stranger footsteps he started up; in the form before him\r\nhe surely recognised a friend\u2014he was not mistaken. With a joyful\r\nexclamation he welcomed Katusthius Ziani, clasping his hand and kissing\r\nhim on the cheek. The traveller was weary, so they retired to Dmitri\u2019s\r\nown home,\u2014a neatly plastered, white-washed cottage, whose earthen floor\r\nwas perfectly dry and clean, and the walls hung with arms\u2014some richly\r\nornamented\u2014and other trophies of his klephtic triumphs. A fire was\r\nkindled by his aged female attendant; the friends reposed on mats of\r\nwhite rushes while she prepared the pilaf and seethed flesh of kid. She\r\nplaced a bright tin-tray on a block of wood before them, and heaped upon\r\nit cakes of Indian corn, goat\u2019s-milk cheese, eggs, and olives; a jar of\r\nwater from their purest spring, and skin of wine, served to refresh and\r\ncheer the thirsty traveller.\r\n\r\nAfter supper the guest spoke of the object of his visit.\r\n\r\n\u201cI come to my pobratimo,\u201d he said, \u201cto claim the performance of his vow.\r\nWhen I rescued you from the savage Kakovougnis of Boularias, you pledged\r\nto me your gratitude and faith; do you disclaim the debt?\u201d\r\n\r\nDmitri\u2019s brow darkened. \u201cMy brother,\u201d he cried, \u201cneed not remind me of\r\nwhat I owe. Command my life; in what can the mountain klepht aid the son\r\nof the wealthy Ziani!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe son of Ziani is a beggar,\u201d rejoined Katusthius, \u201cand must perish if\r\nhis brother deny his assistance.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Moreot then told his tale. He had been brought up as the only son of\r\na rich merchant of Corinth. He had often sailed as caravokeiri[2] of his\r\nfather\u2019s vessels to Stamboul, and even to Calabria. Some years before he\r\nhad been boarded and taken by a Barbary corsair. His life since then had\r\nbeen adventurous, he said; in truth, it had been a guilty one;\u2014he had\r\nbecome a renegade,\u2014and won regard from his new allies, not by his\r\nsuperior courage, for he was cowardly, but by the frauds that make men\r\nwealthy. In the midst of this career some superstition had influenced\r\nhim, and he had returned to his ancient religion. He escaped from\r\nAfrica, wandered through Syria, crossed to Europe, found occupation in\r\nConstantinople; and thus years passed. At last, as he was on the point\r\nof marriage with a Fanariote beauty, he fell again into poverty, and he\r\nreturned to Corinth to see if his father\u2019s fortunes had prospered during\r\nhis long wanderings. He found that while these had improved to a wonder,\r\nthey were lost to him for ever. His father, during his protracted\r\nabsence, acknowledged another son as his; and, dying a year before, had\r\nleft all to him. Katusthius found this unknown kinsman, with his wife\r\nand child, in possession of his expected inheritance. Cyril divided with\r\nhim, it is true, their parent\u2019s property, but Katusthius grasped at all,\r\nand resolved to obtain it. He brooded over a thousand schemes of murder\r\nand revenge; yet the blood of a brother was sacred to him, and Cyril,\r\nbeloved and respected at Corinth, could only be attacked with\r\nconsiderable risk. Then his child was a fresh obstacle. As the best plan\r\nthat presented itself, he hastily embarked for Butrinto, and came to\r\nclaim the advice and assistance of the Arnaoot whose life he had saved,\r\nwhose pobratimo he was. Not thus barely did he tell his tale, but\r\nglossed it over; so that had Dmitri needed the incitement of justice,\r\nwhich was not at all a desideratum with him, he would have been\r\nsatisfied that Cyril was a base interloper, and that the whole\r\ntransaction was one of imposture and villainy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Master of a merchant ship.\r\n\r\nAll night these men discussed a variety of projects, whose aim was, that\r\nthe deceased Ziani\u2019s wealth should pass undivided into his elder son\u2019s\r\nhands. At morning\u2019s dawn Katusthius departed, and two days afterwards\r\nDmitri quitted his mountain-home. His first care had been to purchase a\r\nhorse, long coveted by him on account of its beauty and fleetness; he\r\nprovided cartridges and replenished his powder-horn. His accoutrements\r\nwere rich, his dress gay; his arms glittered in the sun. His long hair\r\nfell straight from under the shawl twisted round his cap, even to his\r\nwaist; a shaggy white capote hung from his shoulder; his face wrinkled\r\nand puckered by exposure to the seasons; his brow furrowed with care;\r\nhis mustachios long and jet-black; his scarred face; his wild, savage\r\neyes;\u2014his whole appearance, not deficient in barbaric grace, but stamped\r\nchiefly with ferocity and bandit pride, inspired, and we need not\r\nwonder, the superstitious Greek with a belief that a supernatural spirit\r\nof evil dwelt in his aspect, blasting and destroying. Now prepared for\r\nhis journey, he departed from Korvo, crossing the woods of Acarnania, on\r\nhis way to Morea.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\u201cWherefore does Zella tremble, and press her boy to her bosom, as if\r\nfearful of evil?\u201d Thus asked Cyril Ziani, returning from the city of\r\nCorinth to his own rural abode. It was a home of beauty. The abruptly\r\nbroken hills covered with olives, or brighter plantations of\r\norange-trees, overlooked the blue waves of the Gulf of Egina. A myrtle\r\nunderwood spread sweet scent around, and dipped its dark shining leaves\r\ninto the sea itself. The low-roofed house was shaded by two enormous\r\nfig-trees, while vineyards and corn-land stretched along the gentle\r\nupland to the north. When Zella saw her husband she smiled, though her\r\ncheek was still pale and her lips quivering. \u201cNow you are near to guard\r\nus,\u201d she said, \u201cI dismiss fear; but danger threatens our Constans, and I\r\nshudder to remember that an Evil Eye has been upon him.\u201d\r\n\r\nCyril caught up his child. \u201cBy my head!\u201d he cried, \u201cthou speakest of an\r\nill thing. The Franks call this superstition; but let us beware. His\r\ncheek is still rosy; his tresses flowing gold. Speak, Constans; hail thy\r\nfather, my brave fellow!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was but a short-lived fear; no ill ensued, and they soon forgot an\r\nincident which had causelessly made their hearts to quail. A week\r\nafterwards Cyril returned, as he was wont, from shipping a cargo of\r\ncurrants, to his retreat on the coast. It was a beautiful summer\r\nevening: the creaking water-wheel, which produced the irrigation of the\r\nland, chimed in with the last song of the noisy cicala; the rippling\r\nwaves spent themselves almost silently among the shingles. This was his\r\nhome; but where its lovely flower? Zella did not come forth to welcome\r\nhim. A domestic pointed to a chapel on a neighbouring acclivity, and\r\nthere he found her; his child (nearly three years of age) was in his\r\nnurse\u2019s arms; his wife was praying fervently, while the tears streamed\r\ndown her cheeks. Cyril demanded anxiously the meaning of this scene; but\r\nthe nurse sobbed; Zella continued to pray and weep; and the boy, from\r\nsympathy, began to cry. This was too much for man to endure. Cyril left\r\nthe chapel; he leant against a walnut-tree. His first exclamation was a\r\ncustomary Greek one, \u201cWelcome this misfortune, so that it come single!\u201d\r\nBut what was the ill that had occurred? Unapparent was it yet; but the\r\nspirit of evil is most fatal when unseen. He was happy,\u2014a lovely wife, a\r\nblooming child, a peaceful home, competence, and the prospect of wealth;\r\nthese blessings were his: yet how often does Fortune use such as her\r\ndecoys? He was a slave in an enslaved land, a mortal subject to the high\r\ndestinies, and ten thousand were the envenomed darts which might be\r\nhurled at his devoted head. Now, timid and trembling, Zella came from\r\nthe chapel: her explanation did not calm his fears. Again the Evil Eye\r\nhad been on his child, and deep malignity lurked surely under this\r\nsecond visitation. The same man, an Arnaoot, with glittering arms, gay\r\nattire, mounted on a black steed, came from the neighbouring ilex grove,\r\nand, riding furiously up to the door, suddenly checked and reined in his\r\nhorse at the very threshold. The child ran towards him: the Arnaoot bent\r\nhis sinister eyes upon him:\u2014\u201cLovely art thou, bright infant,\u201d he cried;\r\n\u201cthy blue eyes are beaming, thy golden tresses fair to see; but thou art\r\na vision fleeting as beautiful;\u2014look at me!\u201d The innocent looked up,\r\nuttered a shriek, and fell gasping on the ground. The women rushed\r\nforward to seize him; the Albanian put spurs to his horse, and,\r\ngalloping swiftly across the little plain, up the wooded hill-side, he\r\nwas soon lost to sight. Zella and the nurse bore the child to the\r\nchapel; they sprinkled him with holy water, and, as he revived, besought\r\nthe Panagia with earnest prayers to save him from the menaced ill.\r\n\r\nSeveral months elapsed; little Constans grew in intelligence and beauty;\r\nno blight had visited the flower of love, and its parents dismissed\r\nfear. Sometimes Cyril indulged in a joke at the expense of the Evil Eye;\r\nbut Zella thought it unlucky to laugh, and crossed herself whenever the\r\nevent was alluded to. At this time Katusthius visited their abode\u2014\u201cHe\r\nwas on his way,\u201d he said, \u201cto Stamboul, and he came to know whether he\r\ncould serve his brother in any of his transactions in the capital.\u201d\r\nCyril and Zella received him with cordial affection: they rejoiced to\r\nperceive that fraternal love was beginning to warm his heart. He seemed\r\nfull of ambition and hope: the brothers discussed his prospects, the\r\npolitics of Europe, and the intrigues of the Fanar: the petty affairs of\r\nCorinth even were made subjects of discourse; and the probability that\r\nin a short time, young as he was, Cyril would be named Codja-Bashee of\r\nthe province. On the morrow, Katusthius prepared to depart. \u201cOne favour\r\ndoes the voluntary exile ask\u2014will my brother and sister accompany me\r\nsome hours on my way to Napoli, whence I embark?\u201d\r\n\r\nZella was unwilling to quit her home, even for a short interval; but she\r\nsuffered herself to be persuaded, and they proceeded altogether for\r\nseveral miles towards the capital of the Morea. At noontide they made a\r\nrepast under the shadow of a grove of oaks, and then separated.\r\nReturning homeward, the wedded pair congratulated themselves on their\r\ntranquil life and peaceful happiness, contrasted with the wanderer\u2019s\r\nlonely and homeless pleasures. These feelings increased in intensity as\r\nthey drew nearer their dwelling, and anticipated the lisped welcome of\r\ntheir idolized child. From an eminence they looked upon the fertile vale\r\nwhich was their home: it was situated on the southern side of the\r\nisthmus, and looked upon the Gulf of Egina\u2014all was verdant, tranquil,\r\nand beautiful. They descended into the plain; there a singular\r\nappearance attracted their attention. A plough with its yoke of oxen had\r\nbeen deserted midway in the furrow; the animals had dragged it to the\r\nside of the field, and endeavoured to repose as well as their\r\nconjunction permitted. The sun already touched its western bourne, and\r\nthe summits of the trees were gilded by its parting beams. All was\r\nsilent; even the eternal water-wheel was still; no menials appeared at\r\ntheir usual rustic labours. From the house the voice of wailing was too\r\nplainly heard.\u2014\u201cMy child!\u201d Zella exclaimed. Cyril began to reassure her;\r\nbut another lament arose, and he hurried on. She dismounted, and would\r\nhave followed him, but sank on the road-side. Her husband returned.\r\n\u201cCourage, my beloved,\u201d he cried; \u201cI will not repose night nor day until\r\nConstans is restored to us\u2014trust to me\u2014farewell!\u201d With these words he\r\nrode swiftly on. Her worst fears were thus confirmed; her maternal\r\nheart, lately so joyous, became the abode of despair, while the nurse\u2019s\r\nnarration of the sad occurrence tended but to add worse fear to fear.\r\nThus it was: the same stranger of the Evil Eye had appeared, not as\r\nbefore, bearing down on them with eagle speed, but as if from a long\r\njourney; his horse lame and with drooping head; the Arnaoot himself\r\ncovered with dust, apparently scarcely able to keep his seat. \u201cBy the\r\nlife of your child,\u201d he said, \u201cgive a cup of water to one who faints\r\nwith thirst.\u201d The nurse, with Constans in her arms, got a bowl of the\r\ndesired liquid, and presented it. Ere the parched lips of the stranger\r\ntouched the wave, the vessel fell from his hands. The woman started\r\nback, while he, at the same moment darting forward, tore with strong arm\r\nthe child from her embrace. Already both were gone\u2014with arrowy speed\r\nthey traversed the plain, while her shrieks, and cries for assistance,\r\ncalled together all the domestics. They followed on the track of the\r\nravisher, and none had yet returned. Now as night closed in, one by one\r\nthey came back: they had nothing to relate; they had scoured the woods,\r\ncrossed the hills\u2014they could not even discover the route which the\r\nAlbanian had taken.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Cyril returned, jaded, haggard, miserable; he had\r\nobtained no tidings of his son. On the morrow he again departed on his\r\nquest, nor came back for several days. Zella passed her time wearily\u2014now\r\nsitting in hopeless despondency, now climbing the near hill to see\r\nwhether she could perceive the approach of her husband. She was not\r\nallowed to remain long thus tranquil; the trembling domestics, left in\r\nguard, warned her that the savage forms of several Arnaoots had been\r\nseen prowling about: she herself saw a tall figure, clad in a shaggy\r\nwhite capote, steal round the promontory, and, on seeing her, shrink\r\nback: once at night the snorting and trampling of a horse roused her,\r\nnot from slumber, but from her sense of security. Wretched as the bereft\r\nmother was, she felt personally almost reckless of danger; but she was\r\nnot her own, she belonged to one beyond expression dear; and duty, as\r\nwell as affection for him, enjoined self-preservation. Cyril, again\r\nreturned: he was gloomier, sadder than before; but there was more\r\nresolution on his brow, more energy in his motions; he had obtained a\r\nclue, yet it might only lead him to the depths of despair.\r\n\r\nHe discovered that Katusthius had not embarked at Napoli. He had joined\r\na band of Arnaoots lurking about Vasilico, and had proceeded to Patras\r\nwith the Protoklepht; thence they put off together in a monoxylon for\r\nthe northern shores of the Gulf of Lepanto: nor were they alone; they\r\nbore a child with them wrapt in a heavy torpid sleep. Poor Cyril\u2019s blood\r\nran cold when he though of the spells and witchcraft which had probably\r\nbeen put in practice on his boy. He would have followed close upon the\r\nrobbers, but for the report that reached him that the remainder of the\r\nAlbanians had proceeded southward towards Corinth. He could not enter\r\nupon a long wandering search among the pathless wilds of Epirus, leaving\r\nZella exposed to the attacks of these bandits. He returned to consult\r\nwith her, to devise some plan of action which would at once ensure her\r\nsafety and promise success to his endeavours.\r\n\r\nAfter some hesitation and discussion, it was decided that he should\r\nfirst conduct her to her native home, consult with her father as to his\r\npresent enterprise, and be guided by his warlike experience before he\r\nrushed into the very focus of danger. The seizure of his child might\r\nonly be a lure, and it were not well for him, sole protector of that\r\nchild and its mother, to rush unadvisedly into the toils.\r\n\r\nZella, strange to say, for her blue eyes and brilliant complexion belied\r\nher birth, was the daughter of a Mainote: yet dreaded and abhorred by\r\nthe rest of the world as are the inhabitants of Cape T\u00e6narus, they are\r\ncelebrated for their domestic virtues and the strength of their private\r\nattachments. Zella loved her father, and the memory of her rugged rocky\r\nhome, from which she had been torn in an adverse hour. Near neighbours\r\nof the Mainotes, dwelling in the ruder and wildest portion of Maina, are\r\nthe Kakovougnis, a dark suspicious race, of squat and stunted form,\r\nstrongly contrasted with the tranquil cast of countenance characteristic\r\nof the Mainote. The two tribes are embroiled in perpetual quarrels; the\r\nnarrow sea-girt abode which they share affords at once a secure place of\r\nrefuge from the foreign enemy and all the facilities of internal\r\nmountain warfare. Cyril had once, during a coasting voyage, been driven\r\nby stress of weather into the little bay on whose shores is placed the\r\nsmall town of Kardamyla. The crew at first dreaded to be captured by the\r\npirates; but they were reassured on finding them fully occupied by their\r\ndomestic dissensions. A band of Kakovougnis were besieging the\r\ncastellated rock overlooking Kardamyla, blockading the fortress in which\r\nthe Mainote Capitano and his family had taken refuge. Two days passed\r\nthus, while furious contrary winds detained Cyril in the bay. On the\r\nthird evening the western gale subsided, and a land-breeze promised to\r\nemancipate them from their perilous condition; when in the night, as\r\nthey were about to put off in a boat from shore, they were hailed by a\r\nparty of Mainotes, and one, an old man of commanding figure, demanded a\r\nparley. He was the Capitano of Kardamyla, the chief of the fortress, now\r\nattacked by his implacable enemies: he saw no escape\u2014he must fall\u2014and\r\nhis chief desire was to save his treasure and his family from the hands\r\nof his enemies. Cyril consented to receive them on board: the latter\r\nconsisted of an old mother, a paramana, and a young and beautiful girl,\r\nhis daughter. Cyril conducted them in safety to Napoli. Soon after the\r\nCapitano\u2019s mother and paramana returned to their native town, while,\r\nwith her father\u2019s consent, fair Zella became the wife of her preserver.\r\nThe fortunes of the Mainote had prospered since then, and he stood first\r\nin rank, the chief of a large tribe, the Capitano of Kardamyla.\r\n\r\nThither then the hapless parents repaired; they embarked on board a\r\nsmall sacovela, which dropt down the Gulf of Egina, weathered the\r\nislands of Skyllo and Cerigo, and the extreme point of T\u00e6narus: favoured\r\nby prosperous gales, they made the desired port, and arrived at the\r\nhospitable mansion of old Camaraz. He heard their tale with indignation;\r\nswore by his beard to dip his poniard in the best blood of Katusthius,\r\nand insisted upon accompanying his son-in-law on his expedition to\r\nAlbania. No time was lost\u2014the grey-headed mariner, still full of energy,\r\nhastened every preparation. Cyril and Zella parted; a thousand fears, a\r\nthousand hours of misery rose between the pair, late sharers in perfect\r\nhappiness. The boisterous sea and distant lands were the smallest of the\r\nobstacles that divided them; they would not fear the worst; yet hope, a\r\nsickly plant, faded in their hearts as they tore themselves asunder\r\nafter a last embrace.\r\n\r\nZella returned from the fertile district of Corinth to her barren native\r\nrocks. She felt all joy expire as she viewed from the rugged shore the\r\nlessening sails of the sacovela. Days and weeks passed, and still she\r\nremained in solitary and sad expectation: she never joined in the dance,\r\nnor made one in the assemblies of her countrywomen, who met together at\r\nevening-tide to sing, tell stories, and wile away the time in dance and\r\ngaiety. She secluded herself in the most lonely part of her father\u2019s\r\nhouse, and gazed unceasingly from the lattice upon the sea beneath, or\r\nwandered on the rocky beach; and when tempest darkened the sky, and each\r\nprecipitous promontory grew purple under the shadows of the wide-winged\r\nclouds, when the roar of the surges was on the shore, and the white\r\ncrests of the waves, seen afar upon the ocean-plain, showed like flocks\r\nof new-shorn sheep scattered along wide-extended downs, she felt neither\r\ngale nor inclement cold, nor returned home till recalled by her\r\nattendants. In obedience to them she sought the shelter of her abode,\r\nnot to remain long; for the wild winds spoke to her, and the stormy\r\nocean reproached her tranquillity. Unable to control the impulse, she\r\nwould rush from her habitation on the cliff, nor remember, till she\r\nreached the shore, that her papooshes were left midway on the\r\nmountain-path, and that her forgotten veil and disordered dress were\r\nunmeet for such a scene. Often the unnumbered hours sped on, while this\r\norphaned child of happiness leant on a cold dark rock; the low-browed\r\ncrags beetled over her, the surges broke at her feet, her fair limbs\r\nwere stained by spray, her tresses dishevelled by the gale. Hopelessly\r\nshe wept until a sail appeared on the horizon; and then she dried her\r\nfast-flowing tears, fixing her large eyes upon the nearing hull or\r\nfading topsail. Meanwhile the storm tossed the clouds into a thousand\r\ngigantic shapes, and the tumultuous sea grew blacker and more wild; her\r\nnatural gloom was heightened by superstitious horror; the Morai, the old\r\nFates of her native Grecian soil, howled in the breezes; apparitions,\r\nwhich told of her child pining under the influence of the Evil Eye, and\r\nof her husband, the prey of some Thracian witchcraft, such as still is\r\npractised in the dread neighbourhood of Larissa, haunted her broken\r\nslumbers, and stalked like dire shadows across her waking thoughts. Her\r\nbloom was gone, her eyes lost their lustre, her limbs their round full\r\nbeauty; her strength failed her, as she tottered to the accustomed spot\r\nto watch\u2014vainly, yet for ever to watch.\r\n\r\nWhat is there so fearful as the expectation of evil tidings delayed?\r\nSometimes in the midst of tears, or worse, amidst the convulsive\r\ngaspings of despair, we reproach ourselves for influencing the eternal\r\nfates by our gloomy anticipations: then, if a smile wreathe the\r\nmourner\u2019s quivering lip, it is arrested by a throb of agony. Alas! are\r\nnot the dark tresses of the young painted grey, the full cheek of beauty\r\ndelved with sad lines by the spirits of such hours? Misery is a more\r\nwelcome visitant when she comes in her darkest guise and wraps us in\r\nperpetual black, for then the heart no longer sickens with disappointed\r\nhope.\r\n\r\nCyril and old Camaraz had found great difficulty in doubling the many\r\ncapes of the Morea as they made a coasting expedition from Kardamyla to\r\nthe Gulf of Arta, north of Cefalonia and St. Mauro. During their voyage\r\nthey had time to arrange their plans. As a number of Moreots travelling\r\ntogether might attract too much attention, they resolved to land their\r\ncomrades at different points, and travel separately into the interior of\r\nAlbania: Yannina was their first place of rendezvous. Cyril and his\r\nfather-in-law disembarked in one of the most secluded of the many creeks\r\nwhich diversify the winding and precipitous shores of the gulf. Six\r\nothers, chosen from the crew, would, by other routes, join them at the\r\ncapital. They did not fear for themselves; alone, but well armed, and\r\nsecure in the courage of despair, they penetrated the fastnesses of\r\nEpirus. No success cheered them: they arrived at Yannina without having\r\nmade the slightest discovery. They were joined by their comrades, whom\r\nthey directed to remain three days in the town, and then separately to\r\nproceed to Terpellen\u00e8, whither they immediately directed their steps. At\r\nthe first village on their way thither, at \u201cmonastic Zitza,\u201d they\r\nobtained some information, not to direct, but to encourage their\r\nendeavours. They sought refreshment and hospitality in the monastery,\r\nwhich is situated on a green eminence, crowned by a grove of oak trees,\r\nimmediately behind the village. Perhaps there is not in the world a more\r\nbeautiful or more romantic spot, sheltered itself by clustering trees,\r\nlooking out on one widespread landscape of hill and dale, enriched by\r\nvineyards, dotted with frequent flocks; while the Calamas in the depth\r\nof the vale gives life to the scene, and the far blue mountains of\r\nZoumerkas, Sagori, Sulli, and Acroceraunia, to the east, west, north,\r\nand south, close in the various prospects. Cyril half envied the\r\nCaloyers their inert tranquillity. They received the travellers gladly,\r\nand were cordial though simple in their manners. When questioned\r\nconcerning the object of their journey, they warmly sympathized with the\r\nfather\u2019s anxiety, and eagerly told all they knew. Two weeks before, an\r\nArnaoot, well known to them as Dmitri of the Evil Eye, a famous klepht\r\nof Korvo, and a Moreot, arrived, bringing with them a child,\u2014a bold,\r\nspirited, beautiful boy, who, with firmness beyond his years, claimed\r\nthe protection of the Caloyers, and accused his companions of having\r\ncarried him off by force from his parents.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy my head!\u201d cried the Albanian, \u201ca brave Palikar: he keeps his word,\r\nbrother; he swore by the Panagia, in spite of our threats of throwing\r\nhim down a precipice, food for the vulture, to accuse us to the first\r\ngood men he saw: he neither pines under the Evil Eye, nor quails beneath\r\nour menaces.\u201d\r\n\r\nKatusthius frowned at these praises, and it became evident during their\r\nstay at the monastery that the Albanian and the Moreot quarrelled as to\r\nthe disposal of the child. The rugged mountaineer threw off all his\r\nsternness as he gazed upon the boy. When little Constans slept, he hung\r\nover him, fanning away with woman\u2019s care the flies and gnats. When he\r\nspoke, he answered with expressions of fondness, winning him with gifts,\r\nteaching him, all child as he was, a mimicry of warlike exercises. When\r\nthe boy knelt and besought the Panagia to restore him to his parents,\r\nhis voice quivering, and tears running down his cheeks, the eyes of\r\nDmitri overflowed; he cast his cloak over his face; his heart whispered\r\nto him: \u201cThus, perhaps, my child prayed. Heaven was deaf. Alas! where is\r\nshe now?\u201d\r\n\r\nEncouraged by such signs of compassion, which children are quick to\r\nperceive, Constans twined his arms round his neck, telling him that he\r\nloved him, and that he would fight for him when a man, if he would take\r\nhim back to Corinth. At such words Dmitri would rush forth, seek\r\nKatusthius, remonstrate with him, till the unrelenting man checked him\r\nby reminding him of his vow. Still he swore that no hair of the child\u2019s\r\nhead should be injured; while the uncle, unvisited by compunction,\r\nmeditated his destruction. The quarrels which thence arose were\r\nfrequent, and violent, till Katusthius, weary of opposition, had\r\nrecourse to craft to obtain his purpose. One night he secretly left the\r\nmonastery, bearing the child with him. When Dmitri heard of his evasion,\r\nit was a fearful thing to the good Caloyers only to look upon him; they\r\ninstinctively clutched hold of every bit of iron on which they could lay\r\ntheir hands, so to avert the Evil Eye which glared with native and\r\nuntamed fierceness. In their panic a whole score of them had rushed to\r\nthe iron-plated door which led out of their abode: with the strength of\r\na lion, Dmitri tore them away, threw back the portal, and, with the\r\nswiftness of a torrent fed by the thawing of the snows in spring, he\r\ndashed down the steep hill\u2014the flight of an eagle not more rapid; the\r\ncourse of a wild beast not more resolved.\r\n\r\nSuch was the clue afforded to Cyril. It were too long to follow him in\r\nhis subsequent search; he, with old Camaraz, wandered through the vale\r\nof Argyro-Castro, and climbed Mount Trebucci to Korvo. Dmitri had\r\nreturned; he had gathered together a score of faithful comrades, and\r\nsallied forth again; various were the reports of his destination, and\r\nthe enterprise which he meditated. One of these led our adventurers to\r\nTerpellen\u00e8, and hence back towards Yannina; and now chance again\r\nfavoured them. They rested one night in the habitation of a priest at\r\nthe little village of Mosme, about three leagues to the north of Zitza;\r\nand here they found an Arnaoot who had been disabled by a fall from his\r\nhorse; this man was to have made one of Dmitri\u2019s band: they learned from\r\nhim that the Arnaoot had tracked Katusthius, following him close, and\r\nforcing him to take refuge in the monastery of the Prophet Elias, which\r\nstands on an elevated peak of the mountains of Sagori, eight leagues\r\nfrom Yannina. Dmitri had followed him, and demanded the child. The\r\nCaloyers refused to give it up, and the klepht, roused to mad\r\nindignation, was now besieging and battering the monastery, to obtain by\r\nforce this object of his newly-awakened affections.\r\n\r\nAt Yannina, Camaraz and Cyril collected their comrades, and departed to\r\njoin their unconscious ally. He, more impetuous than a mountain stream\r\nor ocean\u2019s fiercest waves, struck terror into the hearts of the recluses\r\nby his ceaseless and dauntless attacks. To encourage them to further\r\nresistance, Katusthius, leaving the child behind in the monastery,\r\ndeparted for the nearest town of Sagori, to entreat its Belouk-Bashee to\r\ncome to their aid. The Sagorians are a mild, amiable, social people;\r\nthey are gay, frank, clever; their bravery is universally acknowledged,\r\neven by the more uncivilised mountaineers of Zoumerkas; yet robbery,\r\nmurder, and other acts of violence are unknown among them. These good\r\npeople were not a little indignant when they heard that a band of\r\nArnaoots was besieging and battering the sacred retreat of their\r\nfavourite Caloyers. They assembled in a gallant troop, and, taking\r\nKatusthius with them, hastened to drive the insolent klephts back to\r\ntheir ruder fastnesses. They came too late. At midnight, while the monks\r\nprayed fervently to be delivered from their enemies, Dmitri and his\r\nfollowers tore down their iron-plated door and entered the holy\r\nprecincts. The Protoklepht strode up to the gates of the sanctuary, and,\r\nplacing his hands upon it, swore that he came to save, not to destroy.\r\nConstans saw him. With a cry of delight he disengaged himself from the\r\nCaloyer who held him, and rushed into his arms: this was sufficient\r\ntriumph. With assurance of sincere regret for having disturbed them, the\r\nklepht quitted the chapel with his followers, taking his prize with him.\r\n\r\nKatusthius returned some hours after, and so well did the traitor plead\r\nhis cause with the kind Sagorians, bewailing the fate of his little\r\nnephew among those evil men, that they offered to follow, and, superior\r\nas their numbers were, to rescue the boy from their destructive hands.\r\nKatusthius, delighted with the proposition, urged their immediate\r\ndeparture. At dawn they began to climb the mountain summits, already\r\ntrodden by the Zoumerkians.\r\n\r\nDelighted with repossessing his little favourite, Dmitri placed him\r\nbefore him on his horse, and, followed by his comrades, made his way\r\nover the mountains, clothed with old Dodona\u2019s oaks, or, in higher\r\nsummits, by dark gigantic pines. They proceeded for some hours, and at\r\nlength dismounted to repose. The spot they chose was the depth of a dark\r\nravine, whose gloom was increased by the broad shadows of dark ilexes;\r\nan entangled underwood, and a sprinkling of craggy isolated rocks, made\r\nit difficult for the horses to keep their footing. They dismounted, and\r\nsat by the little stream. Their simple fare was spread, and Dmitri\r\nenticed the boy to eat by a thousand caresses. Suddenly one of his men,\r\nset as a guard, brought intelligence that a troop of Sagorians, with\r\nKatusthius as their guide, was advancing from the monastery of St.\r\nElias; while another man gave the alarm of the approach of six or eight\r\nwell-armed Moreots, who were advancing on the road from Yannina; in a\r\nmoment every sign of encampment had disappeared. The Arnaoots began to\r\nclimb the hills, getting under cover of the rocks, and behind the large\r\ntrunks of the forest trees, keeping concealed till their invaders should\r\nbe in the very midst of them. Soon the Moreots appeared, turning round\r\nthe defile, in a path that only allowed them to proceed two by two; they\r\nwere unaware of danger, and walked carelessly, until a shot that whizzed\r\nover the head of one, striking the bough of a tree, recalled them from\r\ntheir security. The Greeks, accustomed to the same mode of warfare,\r\nbetook themselves also to the safeguards of the rocks, firing from\r\nbehind them, striving with their adversaries which should get to the\r\nmost elevated station; jumping from crag to crag, and dropping down and\r\nfiring as quickly as they could load: one old man alone remained on the\r\npathway. The mariner, Camaraz, had often encountered the enemy on the\r\ndeck of his caick, and would still have rushed foremost at a boarding,\r\nbut this warfare required too much activity. Cyril called on him to\r\nshelter himself beneath a low, broad stone: the Mainote waved his hand.\r\n\u201cFear not for me,\u201d he cried; \u201cI know how to die!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe brave love the brave. Dmitri saw the old man stand, unflinching, a\r\nmark for all the balls, and he started from behind his rocky screen,\r\ncalling on his men to cease. Then addressing his enemy, he cried, \u201cWho\r\nart thou? Wherefore art thou here? If ye come in peace, proceed on your\r\nway. Answer, and fear not!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old man drew himself up, saying, \u201cI am a Mainote, and cannot fear.\r\nAll Hellas trembles before the pirates of Cape Matapan, and I am one of\r\nthese! I do not come in peace! Behold! you have in your arms the cause\r\nof our dissension! I am the grandsire of that child\u2014give him to me!\u201d\r\n\r\nDmitri, had he held a snake which he felt awakening in his bosom, could\r\nnot so suddenly have changed his cheer;\u2014\u201cthe offspring of a Mainote!\u201d\u2014he\r\nrelaxed his grasp;\u2014Constans would have fallen had he not clung to his\r\nneck. Meanwhile each party had descended from their rocky station, and\r\nwere grouped together in the pathway below. Dmitri tore the child from\r\nhis neck\u2014he felt as if he could, with savage delight, dash him down the\r\nprecipice; when, as he paused and trembled from excess of passion,\r\nKatusthius, and the foremost Sagorians, came down upon them.\r\n\r\n\u201cStand!\u201d cried the infuriated Arnaoot. \u201cBehold, Katusthius! behold,\r\nfriend, whom I, driven by the resistless fates, madly and wickedly\r\nforswore! I now perform thy wish\u2014the Mainote child dies! the son of the\r\naccursed race shall be the victim of my just revenge!\u201d\r\n\r\nCyril, in a transport of fear, rushed up the rock; he levelled his\r\nmusket but he feared to sacrifice his child. The old Mainote, less timid\r\nand more desperate, took a steady aim; Dmitri saw the act, and hurled\r\nthe dagger, already raised against the child, at him,\u2014it entered his\r\nside,\u2014while Constans, feeling his late protector\u2019s grasp relax, sprang\r\nfrom it into his father\u2019s arms.\r\n\r\nCamaraz had fallen, yet his wound was slight. He saw the Arnaoots and\r\nSagorians close round him; he saw his own followers made prisoners.\r\nDmitri and Katusthius had both thrown themselves upon Cyril, struggling\r\nto repossess themselves of the screaming boy. The Mainote raised\r\nhimself\u2014he was feeble of limb, but his heart was strong; he threw\r\nhimself before the father and child; he caught the upraised arm of\r\nDmitri. \u201cOn me,\u201d he cried, \u201cfall all thy vengeance! I of the evil race!\r\nfor the child, he is innocent of such parentage! Maina cannot boast him\r\nfor a son!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMan of lies!\u201d commenced the infuriated Arnaoot, \u201cthis falsehood shall\r\nnot stead thee!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay, by the souls of those you have loved, listen!\u201d continued Camaraz,\r\n\u201cand if I make not good my words, may I and my children die! The boy\u2019s\r\nfather is a Corinthian, his mother, a Sciote girl!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cScio!\u201d the very word made the blood recede to Dmitri\u2019s heart.\r\n\u201cVillain!\u201d he cried, dashing aside Katusthius\u2019 arm, which was raised\r\nagainst poor Constans, \u201cI guard this child\u2014dare not to injure him!\r\nSpeak, old man, and fear not, so that thou speakest the truth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFifteen years ago,\u201d said Camaraz, \u201cI hovered with my caick, in search\r\nof prey, on the coast of Scio. A cottage stood on the borders of a\r\nchestnut wood; it was the habitation of the widow of a wealthy\r\nislander\u2014she dwelt in it with her only daughter, married to an Albanian,\r\nthen absent;\u2014the good woman was reported to have a concealed treasure in\r\nher house\u2014the girl herself would be rich spoil\u2014it was an adventure worth\r\nthe risk. We ran our vessel up a shady creek, and, on the going down of\r\nthe moon, landed; stealing under the covert of night towards the lonely\r\nabode of these women.\u201d\r\n\r\nDmitri grasped at his dagger\u2019s hilt\u2014it was no longer there; he half drew\r\na pistol from his girdle\u2014little Constans, again confiding in his former\r\nfriend, stretched out his hands and clung to his arm; the klepht looked\r\non him, half yielded to his desire to embrace him, half feared to be\r\ndeceived; so he turned away, throwing his capote over his face, veiling\r\nhis anguish, controlling his emotions, till all should be told. Camaraz\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt became a worse tragedy than I had contemplated. The girl had a\r\nchild\u2014she feared for its life, and struggled with the men like a tigress\r\ndefending her young. I was in another room seeking for the hidden store,\r\nwhen a piercing shriek rent the air\u2014I never knew what compassion was\r\nbefore\u2014this cry went to my heart; but it was too late, the poor girl had\r\nsunk to the ground, the life-tide oozing from her bosom. I know not why,\r\nbut I turned woman in my regret for the slain beauty. I meant to have\r\ncarried her and her child on board, to see if aught could be done to\r\nsave her, but she died ere we left the shore. I thought she would like\r\nher island grave best, and truly feared that she might turn vampire to\r\nhaunt me, did I carry her away; so we left her corpse for the priests to\r\nbury, and carried off the child, then about two years old. She could say\r\nfew words except her own name\u2014that was Zella, and she is the mother of\r\nthis boy!\u201d\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA succession of arrivals in the bay of Kardamyla had kept poor Zella\r\nwatching for many nights. Her attendant had, in despair of ever seeing\r\nher sleep again, drugged with opium the few cakes she persuaded her to\r\neat, but the poor woman did not calculate on the power of mind over\r\nbody, of love over every enemy, physical or moral, arrayed against it.\r\nZella lay on her couch, her spirit somewhat subdued, but her heart\r\nalive, her eyes unclosed. In the night, led by some unexplained impulse,\r\nshe crawled to her lattice, and saw a little sacovela enter the bay; it\r\nran in swiftly, under favour of the wind, and was lost to her sight\r\nunder a jutting crag. Lightly she trod the marble floor of her chamber;\r\nshe drew a large shawl close round her; she descended the rocky pathway,\r\nand reached, with swift steps, the beach\u2014still the vessel was invisible,\r\nand she was half inclined to think that it was the offspring of her\r\nexcited imagination\u2014yet she lingered. She felt a sickness at her very\r\nheart whenever she attempted to move, and her eyelids weighed down in\r\nspite of herself. The desire of sleep at last became irresistible; she\r\nlay down on the shingles, reposed her head on the cold, hard pillow,\r\nfolded her shawl still closer, and gave herself up to forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nSo profoundly did she slumber under the influence of the opiate, that\r\nfor many hours she was insensible of any change in her situation. By\r\ndegrees only she awoke, by degrees only became aware of the objects\r\naround her; the breeze felt fresh and free\u2014so was it ever on the\r\nwave-beaten coast; the waters rippled near, their dash had been in her\r\nears as she yielded to repose; but this was not her stony couch, that\r\ncanopy, not the dark overhanging cliff. Suddenly she lifted up her\r\nhead\u2014she was on the deck of a small vessel, which was skimming swiftly\r\nover the ocean-waves\u2014a cloak of sables pillowed her head; the shores of\r\nCape Matapan were to her left, and they steered right towards the\r\nnoonday sun. Wonder rather than fear possessed her: with a quick hand\r\nshe drew aside the sail that veiled her from the crew\u2014the dreaded\r\nAlbanian was sitting close at her side, her Constans cradled in his\r\narms; she uttered a cry\u2014Cyril turned at the sound, and in a moment she\r\nwas folded in his embrace.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n\r\n                              _THE DREAM._\r\n\r\n                        \u201cChi dice mal d\u2019amore\r\n                         Dice una falsit\u00e0!\u201d\r\n                                  \u2014ITALIAN SONG.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE time of the occurrence of the little legend about to be narrated,\r\nwas that of the commencement of the reign of Henry IV. of France, whose\r\naccession and conversion, while they brought peace to the kingdom whose\r\nthrone he ascended, were inadequate to heal the deep wounds mutually\r\ninflicted by the inimical parties. Private feuds, and the memory of\r\nmortal injuries, existed between those now apparently united; and often\r\ndid the hands that had clasped each other in seeming friendly greeting,\r\ninvoluntarily, as the grasp was released, clasp the dagger\u2019s hilt, as\r\nfitter spokesman to their passions than the words of courtesy that had\r\njust fallen from their lips. Many of the fiercer Catholics retreated to\r\ntheir distant provinces; and while they concealed in solitude their\r\nrankling discontent, not less keenly did they long for the day when they\r\nmight show it openly.\r\n\r\nIn a large and fortified chateau built on a rugged steep overlooking the\r\nLoire, not far from the town of Nantes, dwelt the last of her race, and\r\nthe heiress of their fortunes, the young and beautiful Countess de\r\nVilleneuve. She had spent the preceding year in complete solitude in her\r\nsecluded abode; and the mourning she wore for a father and two brothers,\r\nthe victims of the civil wars, was a graceful and good reason why she\r\ndid not appear at court, and mingle with its festivities. But the orphan\r\ncountess inherited a high name and broad lands; and it was soon\r\nsignified to her that the king, her guardian, desired that she should\r\nbestow them, together with her hand, upon some noble whose birth and\r\naccomplishments should entitle him to the gift. Constance, in reply,\r\nexpressed her intention of taking vows, and retiring to a convent. The\r\nking earnestly and resolutely forbade this act, believing such an idea\r\nto be the result of sensibility overwrought by sorrow, and relying on\r\nthe hope that, after a time, the genial spirit of youth would break\r\nthrough this cloud.\r\n\r\nA year passed, and still the countess persisted; and at last Henry,\r\nunwilling to exercise compulsion,\u2014desirous, too, of judging for himself\r\nof the motives that led one so beautiful, young, and gifted with\r\nfortune\u2019s favours, to desire to bury herself in a cloister,\u2014announced\r\nhis intention, now that the period of her mourning was expired, of\r\nvisiting her chateau; and if he brought not with him, the monarch said,\r\ninducement sufficient to change her design, he would yield his consent\r\nto its fulfilment.\r\n\r\nMany a sad hour had Constance passed\u2014many a day of tears, and many a\r\nnight of restless misery. She had closed her gates against every\r\nvisitant; and, like the Lady Olivia in \u201cTwelfth Night,\u201d vowed herself to\r\nloneliness and weeping. Mistress of herself, she easily silenced the\r\nentreaties and remonstrances of underlings, and nursed her grief as it\r\nhad been the thing she loved. Yet it was too keen, too bitter, too\r\nburning, to be a favoured guest. In fact, Constance, young, ardent, and\r\nvivacious, battled with it, struggled, and longed to cast it off; but\r\nall that was joyful in itself, or fair in outward show, only served to\r\nrenew it; and she could best support the burden of her sorrow with\r\npatience, when, yielding to it, it oppressed but did not torture her.\r\n\r\nConstance had left the castle to wander in the neighbouring grounds.\r\nLofty and extensive as were the apartments of her abode, she felt pent\r\nup within their walls, beneath their fretted roofs. The spreading\r\nuplands and the antique wood, associated to her with every dear\r\nrecollection of her past life, enticed her to spend hours and days\r\nbeneath their leafy coverts. The motion and change eternally working, as\r\nthe wind stirred among the boughs, or the journeying sun rained its\r\nbeams through them, soothed and called her out of that dull sorrow which\r\nclutched her heart with so unrelenting a pang beneath her castle roof.\r\n\r\nThere was one spot on the verge of the well-wooded park, one nook of\r\nground, whence she could discern the country extended beyond, yet which\r\nwas in itself thick set with tall umbrageous trees\u2014a spot which she had\r\nforsworn, yet whither unconsciously her steps for ever tended, and where\r\nnow again, for the twentieth time that day, she had unaware found\r\nherself. She sat upon a grassy mound, and looked wistfully on the\r\nflowers she had herself planted to adorn the verdurous recess\u2014to her the\r\ntemple of memory and love. She held the letter from the king which was\r\nthe parent to her of so much despair. Dejection sat upon her features,\r\nand her gentle heart asked fate why, so young, unprotected, and\r\nforsaken, she should have to struggle with this new form of\r\nwretchedness.\r\n\r\n\u201cI but ask,\u201d she thought, \u201cto live in my father\u2019s halls\u2014in the spot\r\nfamiliar to my infancy\u2014to water with my frequent tears the graves of\r\nthose I loved; and here in these woods, where such a mad dream of\r\nhappiness was mine, to celebrate for ever the obsequies of Hope!\u201d\r\n\r\nA rustling among the boughs now met her ear\u2014her heart beat quick\u2014all\r\nagain was still.\r\n\r\n\u201cFoolish girl!\u201d she half muttered; \u201cdupe of thine own passionate fancy:\r\nbecause here we met; because seated here I have expected, and sounds\r\nlike these have announced, his dear approach; so now every coney as it\r\nstirs, and every bird as it awakens silence, speaks of him. O\r\nGaspar!\u2014mine once\u2014never again will this beloved spot be made glad by\r\nthee\u2014never more!\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain the bushes were stirred, and footsteps were heard in the brake.\r\nShe rose; her heart beat high; it must be that silly Manon, with her\r\nimpertinent entreaties for her to return. But the steps were firmer and\r\nslower than would be those of her waiting-woman; and now emerging from\r\nthe shade, she too plainly discerned the intruder. Her first impulse was\r\nto fly:\u2014but once again to see him\u2014to hear his voice:\u2014once again before\r\nshe placed eternal vows between them, to stand together, and find the\r\nwide chasm filled which absence had made, could not injure the dead, and\r\nwould soften the fatal sorrow that made her cheek so pale.\r\n\r\nAnd now he was before her, the same beloved one with whom she had\r\nexchanged vows of constancy. He, like her, seemed sad; nor could she\r\nresist the imploring glance that entreated her for one moment to remain.\r\n\r\n\u201cI come, lady,\u201d said the young knight, \u201cwithout a hope to bend your\r\ninflexible will. I come but once again to see you, and to bid you\r\nfarewell before I depart for the Holy Land. I come to beseech you not to\r\nimmure yourself in the dark cloister to avoid one as hateful as\r\nmyself,\u2014one you will never see more. Whether I die or live, France and I\r\nare parted for ever!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat were fearful, were it true,\u201d said Constance; \u201cbut King Henry will\r\nnever so lose his favourite cavalier. The throne you helped to build,\r\nyou still will guard. Nay, as I ever had power over thought of thine, go\r\nnot to Palestine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne word of yours could detain me\u2014one smile\u2014Constance\u201d\u2014and the youthful\r\nlover knelt before her; but her harsher purpose was recalled by the\r\nimage once so dear and familiar, now so strange and so forbidden.\r\n\r\n\u201cLinger no longer here!\u201d she cried. \u201cNo smile, no word of mine will ever\r\nagain be yours. Why are you here\u2014here, where the spirits of the dead\r\nwander, and, claiming these shades as their own, curse the false girl\r\nwho permits their murderer to disturb their sacred repose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen love was young and you were kind,\u201d replied the knight, \u201cyou taught\r\nme to thread the intricacies of these woods\u2014you welcomed me to this dear\r\nspot, where once you vowed to be my own\u2014even beneath these ancient\r\ntrees.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA wicked sin it was,\u201d said Constance, \u201cto unbar my father\u2019s doors to\r\nthe son of his enemy, and dearly is it punished!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young knight gained courage as she spoke; yet he dared not move,\r\nlest she, who, every instant, appeared ready to take flight, should be\r\nstartled from her momentary tranquillity; but he slowly replied:\u2014\u201cThose\r\nwere happy days, Constance, full of terror and deep joy, when evening\r\nbrought me to your feet; and while hate and vengeance were as its\r\natmosphere to yonder frowning castle, this leafy, starlit bower was the\r\nshrine of love.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Happy?_\u2014miserable days!\u201d echoed Constance; \u201cwhen I imagined good could\r\narise from failing in my duty, and that disobedience would be rewarded\r\nof God. Speak not of love, Gaspar!\u2014a sea of blood divides us for ever!\r\nApproach me not! The dead and the beloved stand even now between us:\r\ntheir pale shadows warn me of my fault, and menace me for listening to\r\ntheir murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat am not I!\u201d exclaimed the youth. \u201cBehold, Constance, we are each\r\nthe last of our race. Death has dealt cruelly with us, and we are alone.\r\nIt was not so when first we loved\u2014when parent, kinsman, brother, nay, my\r\nown mother breathed curses on the house of Villeneuve; and in spite of\r\nall I blessed it. I saw thee, my lovely one, and blessed it. The God of\r\npeace planted love in our hearts, and with mystery and secrecy we met\r\nduring many a summer night in the moonlit dells; and when daylight was\r\nabroad, in this sweet recess we fled to avoid its scrutiny, and here,\r\neven here, where now I kneel in supplication, we both knelt and made our\r\nvows. Shall they be broken?\u201d\r\n\r\nConstance wept as her lover recalled the images of happy hours. \u201cNever,\u201d\r\nshe exclaimed, \u201cO never! Thou knowest, or wilt soon know, Gaspar, the\r\nfaith and resolves of one who dare not be yours. Was it for us to talk\r\nof love and happiness, when war, and hate, and blood were raging around?\r\nThe fleeting flowers our young hands strewed were trampled by the deadly\r\nencounter of mortal foes. By your father\u2019s hand mine died; and little\r\nboots it to know whether, as my brother swore, and you deny, your hand\r\ndid or did not deal the blow that destroyed him. You fought among those\r\nby whom he died. Say no more\u2014no other word: it is impiety towards the\r\nunreposing dead to hear you. Go, Gaspar; forget me. Under the chivalrous\r\nand gallant Henry your career may be glorious; and some fair girl will\r\nlisten, as once I did, to your vows, and be made happy by them.\r\nFarewell! May the Virgin bless you! In my cell and cloister-home I will\r\nnot forget the best Christian lesson\u2014to pray for our enemies. Gaspar,\r\nfarewell!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe glided hastily from the bower: with swift steps she threaded the\r\nglade and sought the castle. Once within the seclusion of her own\r\napartment she gave way to the burst of grief that tore her gentle bosom\r\nlike a tempest; for hers was that worst sorrow which taints past joys,\r\nmaking remorse wait upon the memory of bliss, and linking love and\r\nfancied guilt in such fearful society as that of the tyrant when he\r\nbound a living body to a corpse. Suddenly a thought darted into her\r\nmind. At first she rejected it as puerile and superstitious; but it\r\nwould not be driven away. She called hastily for her attendant. \u201cManon,\u201d\r\nshe said, \u201cdidst thou ever sleep on St. Catherine\u2019s couch?\u201d\r\n\r\nManon crossed herself. \u201cHeaven forefend! None ever did, since I was\r\nborn, but two: one fell into the Loire and was drowned; the other only\r\nlooked upon the narrow bed, and returned to her own home without a word.\r\nIt is an awful place; and if the votary have not led a pious and good\r\nlife, woe betide the hour when she rests her head on the holy stone!\u201d\r\n\r\nConstance crossed herself also. \u201cAs for our lives, it is only through\r\nour Lord and the blessed saints that we can any of us hope for\r\nrighteousness. I will sleep on that couch to-morrow night!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear, my lady! and the king arrives to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe more need that I resolve. It cannot be that misery so intense\r\nshould dwell in any heart, and no cure be found. I had hoped to be the\r\nbringer of peace to our houses; and is the good work to be for me a\r\ncrown of thorns? Heaven shall direct me. I will rest to-morrow night on\r\nSt. Catherine\u2019s bed: and if, as I have heard, the saint deigns to direct\r\nher votaries in dreams, I will be guided by her; and, believing that I\r\nact according to the dictates of Heaven, I shall feel resigned even to\r\nthe worst.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe king was on his way to Nantes from Paris, and he slept on this night\r\nat a castle but a few miles distant. Before dawn a young cavalier was\r\nintroduced into his chamber. The knight had a serious, nay, a sad\r\naspect; and all beautiful as he was in feature and limb, looked wayworn\r\nand haggard. He stood silent in Henry\u2019s presence, who, alert and gay,\r\nturned his lively blue eyes upon his guest, saying gently, \u201cSo thou\r\nfoundest her obdurate, Gaspar?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI found her resolved on our mutual misery. Alas! my liege, it is not,\r\ncredit me, the least of my grief, that Constance sacrifices her own\r\nhappiness when she destroys mine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd thou believest that she will say nay to the gaillard chevalier whom\r\nwe ourselves present to her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my liege, think not that thought! it cannot be. My heart deeply,\r\nmost deeply, thanks you for your generous condescension. But she whom\r\nher lover\u2019s voice in solitude\u2014whose entreaties, when memory and\r\nseclusion aided the spell\u2014could not persuade, will resist even your\r\nmajesty\u2019s commands. She is bent upon entering a cloister; and I, so\r\nplease you, will now take my leave:\u2014I am henceforth a soldier of the\r\ncross.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGaspar,\u201d said the monarch, \u201cI know woman better than thou. It is not by\r\nsubmission nor tearful plaints she is to be won. The death of her\r\nrelatives naturally sits heavy at the young countess\u2019s heart; and\r\nnourishing in solitude her regret and her repentance, she fancies that\r\nHeaven itself forbids your union. Let the voice of the world reach\r\nher\u2014the voice of earthly power and earthly kindness\u2014the one commanding,\r\nthe other pleading, and both finding response in her own heart\u2014and by my\r\nfay and the Holy Cross, she will be yours. Let our plan still hold. And\r\nnow to horse: the morning wears, and the sun is risen.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe king arrived at the bishop\u2019s palace, and proceeded forthwith to mass\r\nin the cathedral. A sumptuous dinner succeeded, and it was afternoon\r\nbefore the monarch proceeded through the town beside the Loire to where,\r\na little above Nantes, the Chateau Villeneuve was situated. The young\r\ncountess received him at the gate. Henry looked in vain for the cheek\r\nblanched by misery, the aspect of downcast despair which he had been\r\ntaught to expect. Her cheek was flushed, her manner animated, her voice\r\nscarce tremulous. \u201cShe loves him not,\u201d thought Henry, \u201cor already her\r\nheart has consented.\u201d\r\n\r\nA collation was prepared for the monarch; and after some little\r\nhesitation, arising even from the cheerfulness of her mien, he mentioned\r\nthe name of Gaspar. Constance blushed instead of turning pale, and\r\nreplied very quickly, \u201cTo-morrow, good my liege; I ask for a respite but\r\nuntil to-morrow;\u2014all will then be decided;\u2014to-morrow I am vowed to\r\nGod\u2014or\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\nShe looked confused, and the king, at once surprised and pleased, said,\r\n\u201cThen you hate not young De Vaudemont;\u2014you forgive him for the inimical\r\nblood that warms his veins.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are taught that we should forgive, that we should love our enemies,\u201d\r\nthe countess replied, with some trepidation.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, by Saint Denis, that is a right welcome answer for the novice,\u201d\r\nsaid the king, laughing. \u201cWhat ho! my faithful serving-man, Dan Apollo\r\nin disguise! come forward, and thank your lady for her love.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn such disguise as had concealed him from all, the cavalier had hung\r\nbehind, and viewed with infinite surprise the demeanour and calm\r\ncountenance of the lady. He could not hear her words: but was this even\r\nshe whom he had seen trembling and weeping the evening before?\u2014this she\r\nwhose very heart was torn by conflicting passion?\u2014who saw the pale\r\nghosts of parent and kinsman stand between her and the lover whom more\r\nthan her life she adored? It was a riddle hard to solve. The king\u2019s call\r\nwas in unison with his impatience, and he sprang forward. He was at her\r\nfeet; while she, still passion-driven, overwrought by the very calmness\r\nshe had assumed, uttered one cry as she recognised him, and sank\r\nsenseless on the floor.\r\n\r\nAll this was very unintelligible. Even when her attendants had brought\r\nher to life, another fit succeeded, and then passionate floods of tears;\r\nwhile the monarch, waiting in the hall, eyeing the half-eaten collation,\r\nand humming some romance in commemoration of woman\u2019s waywardness, knew\r\nnot how to reply to Vaudemont\u2019s look of bitter disappointment and\r\nanxiety. At length the countess\u2019 chief attendant came with an apology:\r\n\u201cHer lady was ill, very ill The next day she would throw herself at the\r\nking\u2019s feet, at once to solicit his excuse, and to disclose her\r\npurpose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-morrow\u2014again to-morrow!\u2014Does to-morrow bear some charm, maiden?\u201d\r\nsaid the king. \u201cCan you read us the riddle, pretty one? What strange\r\ntale belongs to to-morrow, that all rests on its advent?\u201d\r\n\r\nManon coloured, looked down, and hesitated. But Henry was no tyro in the\r\nart of enticing ladies\u2019 attendants to disclose their ladies\u2019 counsel.\r\nManon was besides frightened by the countess\u2019 scheme, on which she was\r\nstill obstinately bent, so she was the more readily induced to betray\r\nit. To sleep in St. Catherine\u2019s bed, to rest on a narrow ledge\r\noverhanging the deep rapid Loire, and if, as was most probable, the\r\nluckless dreamer escaped from falling into it, to take the disturbed\r\nvisions that such uneasy slumber might produce for the dictate of\r\nHeaven, was a madness of which even Henry himself could scarcely deem\r\nany woman capable. But could Constance, her whose beauty was so highly\r\nintellectual, and whom he had heard perpetually praised for her strength\r\nof mind and talents, could _she_ be so strangely infatuated! And can\r\npassion play such freaks with us?\u2014like death, levelling even the\r\naristocracy of the soul, and bringing noble and peasant, the wise and\r\nfoolish, under one thraldom? It was strange\u2014yet she must have her way.\r\nThat she hesitated in her decision was much; and it was to be hoped that\r\nSt. Catherine would play no ill-natured part. Should it be otherwise, a\r\npurpose to be swayed by a dream might be influenced by other waking\r\nthoughts. To the more material kind of danger some safeguard should be\r\nbrought.\r\n\r\nThere is no feeling more awful than that which invades a weak human\r\nheart bent upon gratifying its ungovernable impulses in contradiction to\r\nthe dictates of conscience. Forbidden pleasures are said to be the most\r\nagreeable;\u2014it may be so to rude natures, to those who love to struggle,\r\ncombat, and contend; who find happiness in a fray, and joy in the\r\nconflict of passion. But softer and sweeter was the gentle spirit of\r\nConstance; and love and duty contending crushed and tortured her poor\r\nheart. To commit her conduct to the inspirations of religion, or, if it\r\nwas so to be named, of superstition, was a blessed relief. The very\r\nperils that threatened her undertaking gave a zest to it;\u2014to dare for\r\nhis sake was happiness;\u2014the very difficulty of the way that led to the\r\ncompletion of her wishes at once gratified her love and distracted her\r\nthoughts from her despair. Or if it was decreed that she must sacrifice\r\nall, the risk of danger and of death were of trifling import in\r\ncomparison with the anguish which would then be her portion for ever.\r\n\r\nThe night threatened to be stormy, the raging wind shook the casements,\r\nand the trees waved their huge shadowy arms, as giants might in\r\nfantastic dance and mortal broil. Constance and Manon, unattended,\r\nquitted the chateau by a postern, and began to descend the hill-side.\r\nThe moon had not yet risen; and though the way was familiar to both,\r\nManon tottered and trembled; while the countess, drawing her silken\r\ncloak round her, walked with a firm step down the steep. They came to\r\nthe river\u2019s side, where a small boat was moored, and one man was in\r\nwaiting. Constance stepped lightly in, and then aided her fearful\r\ncompanion. In a few moments they were in the middle of the stream. The\r\nwarm, tempestuous, animating, equinoctial wind swept over them. For the\r\nfirst time since her mourning, a thrill of pleasure swelled the bosom of\r\nConstance. She hailed the emotion with double joy. It cannot be, she\r\nthought, that Heaven will forbid me to love one so brave, so generous,\r\nand so good as the noble Gaspar. Another I can never love; I shall die\r\nif divided from him; and this heart, these limbs, so alive with glowing\r\nsensation, are they already predestined to an early grave? Oh no! life\r\nspeaks aloud within them. I shall live to love. Do not all things\r\nlove?\u2014the winds as they whisper to the rushing waters? the waters as\r\nthey kiss the flowery banks, and speed to mingle with the sea? Heaven\r\nand earth are sustained by, and live through, love; and shall Constance\r\nalone, whose heart has ever been a deep, gushing, overflowing well of\r\ntrue affection, be compelled to set a stone upon the fount to lock it up\r\nfor ever?\r\n\r\nThese thoughts bade fair for pleasant dreams; and perhaps the countess,\r\nan adept in the blind god\u2019s lore, therefore indulged them the more\r\nreadily. But as thus she was engrossed by soft emotions, Manon caught\r\nher arm:\u2014\u201cLady, look,\u201d she cried; \u201cit comes\u2014yet the oars have no sound.\r\nNow the Virgin shield us! Would we were at home!\u201d\r\n\r\nA dark boat glided by them. Four rowers, habited in black cloaks, pulled\r\nat oars which, as Manon said, gave no sound; another sat at the helm:\r\nlike the rest, his person was veiled in a dark mantle, but he wore no\r\ncap; and though his face was turned from them, Constance recognised her\r\nlover. \u201cGaspar,\u201d she cried aloud, \u201cdost thou live?\u201d\u2014but the figure in\r\nthe boat neither turned its head nor replied, and quickly it was lost in\r\nthe shadowy waters.\r\n\r\nHow changed now was the fair countess\u2019 reverie! Already Heaven had begun\r\nits spell, and unearthly forms were around, as she strained her eyes\r\nthrough the gloom. Now she saw and now she lost view of the bark that\r\noccasioned her terror; and now it seemed that another was there, which\r\nheld the spirits of the dead; and her father waved to her from shore,\r\nand her brothers frowned on her.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile they neared the landing. Her bark was moored in a little cove,\r\nand Constance stood upon the bank. Now she trembled, and half yielded to\r\nManon\u2019s entreaty to return; till the unwise _suivante_ mentioned the\r\nking\u2019s and De Vaudemont\u2019s name, and spoke of the answer to be given\r\nto-morrow. What answer, if she turned back from her intent?\r\n\r\nShe now hurried forward up the broken ground of the bank, and then along\r\nits edge, till they came to a hill which abruptly hung over the tide. A\r\nsmall chapel stood near. With trembling fingers the countess drew forth\r\nthe key and unlocked its door. They entered. It was dark\u2014save that a\r\nlittle lamp, flickering in the wind, showed an uncertain light from\r\nbefore the figure of Saint Catherine. The two women knelt; they prayed;\r\nand then rising, with a cheerful accent the countess bade her attendant\r\ngood-night. She unlocked a little low iron door. It opened on a narrow\r\ncavern. The roar of waters was heard beyond. \u201cThou mayest not follow, my\r\npoor Manon,\u201d said Constance,\u2014\u201cnor dost thou much desire:\u2014this adventure\r\nis for me alone.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was hardly fair to leave the trembling servant in the chapel alone,\r\nwho had neither hope nor fear, nor love, nor grief to beguile her; but,\r\nin those days, esquires and waiting-women often played the part of\r\nsubalterns in the army, gaining knocks and no fame. Besides, Manon was\r\nsafe in holy ground. The countess meanwhile pursued her way groping in\r\nthe dark through the narrow tortuous passage. At length what seemed\r\nlight to her long-darkened sense gleamed on her. She reached an open\r\ncavern in the overhanging hill\u2019s side, looking over the rushing tide\r\nbeneath. She looked out upon the night. The waters of the Loire were\r\nspeeding, as since that day have they ever sped\u2014changeful, yet the same;\r\nthe heavens were thickly veiled with clouds, and the wind in the trees\r\nwas as mournful and ill-omened as if it rushed round a murderer\u2019s tomb.\r\nConstance shuddered a little, and looked upon her bed,\u2014a narrow ledge of\r\nearth and a moss-grown stone bordering on the very verge of the\r\nprecipice. She doffed her mantle,\u2014such was one of the conditions of the\r\nspell;\u2014she bowed her head, and loosened the tresses of her dark hair;\r\nshe bared her feet; and thus, fully prepared for suffering to the utmost\r\nthe chill influence of the cold night, she stretched herself on the\r\nnarrow couch that scarce afforded room for her repose, and whence, if\r\nshe moved in sleep, she must be precipitated into the cold waters below.\r\n\r\nAt first it seemed to her as if she never should sleep again. No great\r\nwonder that exposure to the blast and her perilous position should\r\nforbid her eyelids to close. At length she fell into a reverie so soft\r\nand soothing that she wished even to watch; and then by degrees her\r\nsenses became confused; and now she was on St. Catherine\u2019s bed\u2014the Loire\r\nrushing beneath, and the wild wind sweeping by\u2014and now\u2014oh whither?\u2014and\r\nwhat dreams did the saint send, to drive her to despair, or to bid her\r\nbe blest for ever?\r\n\r\nBeneath the rugged hill, upon the dark tide, another watched, who feared\r\na thousand things, and scarce dared hope. He had meant to precede the\r\nlady on her way, but when he found that he had outstayed his time, with\r\nmuffled oars and breathless haste he had shot by the bark that contained\r\nhis Constance, nor even turned at her voice, fearful to incur her blame,\r\nand her commands to return. He had seen her emerge from the passage, and\r\nshuddered as she leant over the cliff. He saw her step forth, clad as\r\nshe was in white, and could mark her as she lay on the ledge beetling\r\nabove. What a vigil did the lovers keep!\u2014she given up to visionary\r\nthoughts, he knowing\u2014and the consciousness thrilled his bosom with\r\nstrange emotion\u2014that love, and love for him, had led her to that\r\nperilous couch; and that while dangers surrounded her in every shape,\r\nshe was alive only to the small still voice that whispered to her heart\r\nthe dream which was to decide their destinies. She slept perhaps\u2014but he\r\nwaked and watched, and night wore away, as, now praying, now entranced\r\nby alternating hope and fear, he sat in his boat, his eyes fixed on the\r\nwhite garb of the slumberer above.\r\n\r\nMorning\u2014was it morning that struggled in the clouds? Would morning ever\r\ncome to waken her? And had she slept? and what dreams of weal or woe had\r\npeopled her sleep? Gaspar grew impatient. He commanded his boatmen still\r\nto wait, and he sprang forward, intent on clambering the precipice. In\r\nvain they urged the danger, nay, the impossibility of the attempt; he\r\nclung to the rugged face of the hill, and found footing where it would\r\nseem no footing was. The acclivity, indeed, was not high; the dangers of\r\nSt. Catherine\u2019s bed arising from the likelihood that any one who slept\r\non so narrow a couch would be precipitated into the waters beneath. Up\r\nthe steep ascent Gaspar continued to toil, and at last reached the roots\r\nof a tree that grew near the summit. Aided by its branches, he made good\r\nhis stand at the very extremity of the ledge, near the pillow on which\r\nlay the uncovered head of his beloved. Her hands were folded on her\r\nbosom; her dark hair fell round her throat and pillowed her cheek; her\r\nface was serene: sleep was there in all its innocence and in all its\r\nhelplessness; every wilder emotion was hushed, and her bosom heaved in\r\nregular breathing. He could see her heart beat as it lifted her fair\r\nhands crossed above. No statue hewn of marble in monumental effigy was\r\never half so fair; and within that surpassing form dwelt a soul true,\r\ntender, self-devoted, and affectionate as ever warmed a human breast.\r\n\r\nWith what deep passion did Gaspar gaze, gathering hope from the\r\nplacidity of her angel countenance! A smile wreathed her lips; and he\r\ntoo involuntarily smiled, as he hailed the happy omen; when suddenly her\r\ncheek was flushed, her bosom heaved, a tear stole from her dark lashes,\r\nand then a whole shower fell, as starting up she cried, \u201cNo!\u2014he shall\r\nnot die!\u2014I will unloose his chains!\u2014I will save him!\u201d Gaspar\u2019s hand was\r\nthere. He caught her light form ready to fall from the perilous couch.\r\nShe opened her eyes and beheld her lover, who had watched over her dream\r\nof fate, and who had saved her.\r\n\r\nManon also had slept well, dreaming or not, and was startled in the\r\nmorning to find that she waked surrounded by a crowd. The little\r\ndesolate chapel was hung with tapestry\u2014the altar adorned with golden\r\nchalices\u2014the priest was chanting mass to a goodly array of kneeling\r\nknights. Manon saw that King Henry was there; and she looked for another\r\nwhom she found not, when the iron door of the cavern passage opened, and\r\nGaspar de Vaudemont entered from it, leading the fair form of Constance;\r\nwho, in her white robes and dark dishevelled hair, with a face in which\r\nsmiles and blushes contended with deeper emotion, approached the altar,\r\nand, kneeling with her lover, pronounced the vows that united them for\r\never.\r\n\r\nIt was long before the happy Gaspar could win from his lady the secret\r\nof her dream. In spite of the happiness she now enjoyed, she had\r\nsuffered too much not to look back even with terror to those days when\r\nshe thought love a crime, and every event connected with them wore an\r\nawful aspect. \u201cMany a vision,\u201d she said, \u201cshe had that fearful night.\r\nShe had seen the spirits of her father and brothers in Paradise; she had\r\nbeheld Gaspar victoriously combating among the infidels; she had beheld\r\nhim in King Henry\u2019s court, favoured and beloved; and she herself\u2014now\r\npining in a cloister, now a bride, now grateful to Heaven for the full\r\nmeasure of bliss presented to her, now weeping away her sad days\u2014till\r\nsuddenly she thought herself in Paynim land; and the saint herself, St\r\nCatherine, guiding her unseen through the city of the infidels. She\r\nentered a palace, and beheld the miscreants rejoicing in victory; and\r\nthen, descending to the dungeons beneath, they groped their way through\r\ndamp vaults, and low, mildewed passages, to one cell, darker and more\r\nfrightful than the rest. On the floor lay one with soiled and tattered\r\ngarments, with unkempt locks and wild, matted beard. His cheek was worn\r\nand thin; his eyes had lost their fire; his form was a mere skeleton;\r\nthe chains hung loosely on the fleshless bones.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd was it my appearance in that attractive state and winning costume\r\nthat softened the hard heart of Constance!\u201d asked Gaspar, smiling at\r\nthis painting of what would never be.\r\n\r\n\u201cEven so,\u201d replied Constance; \u201cfor my heart whispered me that this was\r\nmy doing; and who could recall the life that waned in your pulses\u2014who\r\nrestore, save the destroyer! My heart never warmed to my living, happy\r\nknight as then it did to his wasted image as it lay, in the visions of\r\nnight, at my feet. A veil fell from my eyes; a darkness was dispelled\r\nfrom before me. Methought I then knew for the first time what life and\r\nwhat death was. I was bid believe that to make the living happy was not\r\nto injure the dead; and I felt how wicked and how vain was that false\r\nphilosophy which placed virtue and good in hatred and unkindness. You\r\nshould not die; I would loosen your chains and save you, and bid you\r\nlive for love. I sprung forward, and the death I deprecated for you\r\nwould, in my presumption, have been mine,\u2014then, when first I felt the\r\nreal value of life,\u2014but that your arm was there to save me, your dear\r\nvoice to bid me be blest for evermore.\u201d\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V.\r\n\r\n                             _THE MOURNER._\r\n\r\n          \u201cOne fatal remembrance, one sorrow that throws\r\n           Its bleak shade alike o\u2019er our joys and our woes,\r\n           To which life nothing darker or brighter can bring,\r\n           For which joy has no balm, and affliction no sting!\u201d\r\n                         \u2014MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GORGEOUS scene of kingly pride is the prospect now before us!\u2014the\r\noffspring of art, the nursling of nature\u2014where can the eye rest on a\r\nlandscape more deliciously lovely than the fair expanse of Virginia\r\nWater, now an open mirror to the sky, now shaded by umbrageous banks,\r\nwhich wind into dark recesses, or are rounded into soft promontories?\r\nLooking down on it, now that the sun is low in the west, the eye is\r\ndazzled, the soul oppressed, by excess of beauty. Earth, water, air\r\ndrink to overflowing the radiance that streams from yonder well of\r\nlight; the foliage of the trees seems dripping with the golden flood;\r\nwhile the lake, filled with no earthly dew, appears but an imbasining of\r\nthe sun-tinctured atmosphere; and trees and gay pavilion float in its\r\ndepth, more dear, more distinct than their twins in the upper air. Nor\r\nis the scene silent: strains more sweet than those that lull Venus to\r\nher balmy rest, more inspiring than the song of Tiresias which awoke\r\nAlexander to the deed of ruin, more solemn than the chantings of St.\r\nCecilia, float along the waves and mingle with the lagging breeze, which\r\nruffles not the lake. Strange, that a few dark scores should be the key\r\nto this fountain of sound; the unconscious link between unregarded noise\r\nand harmonies which unclose paradise to our entranced senses!\r\n\r\nThe sun touches the extreme boundary, and a softer, milder light mingles\r\na roseate tinge with the fiery glow. Our boat has floated long on the\r\nbroad expanse; now let it approach the umbrageous bank. The green\r\ntresses of the graceful willow dip into the waters, which are checked by\r\nthem into a ripple. The startled teal dart from their recess, skimming\r\nthe waves with splashing wing. The stately swans float onward; while\r\ninnumerable waterfowl cluster together out of the way of the oars. The\r\ntwilight is blotted by no dark shades; it is one subdued, equal receding\r\nof the great tide of day. We may disembark, and wander yet amid the\r\nglades, long before the thickening shadows speak of night. The\r\nplantations are formed of every English tree, with an old oak or two\r\nstanding out in the walks. There the glancing foliage obscures heaven,\r\nas the silken texture of a veil a woman\u2019s lovely features. Beneath such\r\nfretwork we may indulge in light-hearted thoughts; or, if sadder\r\nmeditations lead us to seek darker shades, we may pass the cascade\r\ntowards the large groves of pine, with their vast undergrowth of laurel,\r\nreaching up to the Belvidere; or, on the opposite side of the water, sit\r\nunder the shadow of the silver-stemmed birch, or beneath the leafy\r\npavilions of those fine old beeches, whose high fantastic roots seem\r\nformed in nature\u2019s sport; and the near jungle of sweet-smelling myrica\r\nleaves no sense unvisited by pleasant ministration.\r\n\r\nNow this splendid scene is reserved for the royal possessor; but in past\r\nyears; while the lodge was called the Regent\u2019s Cottage, or before, when\r\nthe under-ranger inhabited it, the mazy paths of Chapel Wood were open,\r\nand the iron gates enclosing the plantations and Virginia Water were\r\nguarded by no Cerebus untamable by sops. It was here, on a summer\u2019s\r\nevening, that Horace Neville and his two fair cousins floated idly on\r\nthe placid lake,\r\n\r\n               \u201cIn that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts\r\n                Bring sad thoughts to the mind.\u201d\r\n\r\nNeville had been eloquent in praise of English scenery. \u201cIn distant\r\nclimes,\u201d he said, \u201cwe may find landscapes grand in barbaric wildness, or\r\nrich in the luxuriant vegetation of the south, or sublime in Alpine\r\nmagnificence. We may lament, though it is ungrateful to say so on such a\r\nnight as this, the want of a more genial sky; but where find scenery to\r\nbe compared to the verdant, well-wooded, well-watered groves of our\r\nnative land; the clustering cottages, shadowed by fine old elms; each\r\ngarden blooming with early flowers, each lattice gay with geraniums and\r\nroses; the blue-eyed child devouring his white bread, while he drives a\r\ncow to graze; the hedge redolent with summer blooms; the enclosed\r\ncornfields, seas of golden grain, weltering in the breeze; the stile,\r\nthe track across the meadow, leading through the copse, under which the\r\npath winds, and the meeting branches overhead, which give, by their\r\ndimming tracery, a cathedral-like solemnity to the scene; the river,\r\nwinding \u2018with sweet inland murmur;\u2019 and, as additional graces, spots\r\nlike these\u2014oases of taste\u2014gardens of Eden\u2014the works of wealth, which\r\nevince at once the greatest power and the greatest will to create\r\nbeauty?\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d continued Neville, \u201cit was with difficulty that I persuaded\r\nmyself to reap the best fruits of my uncle\u2019s will, and to inhabit this\r\nspot, familiar to my boyhood, associated with unavailing regrets and\r\nrecollected pain.\u201d\r\n\r\nHorace Neville was a man of birth\u2014of wealth; but he could hardly be\r\ntermed a man of the world. There was in his nature a gentleness, a\r\nsweetness, a winning sensibility, allied to talent and personal\r\ndistinction, that gave weight to his simplest expressions, and excited\r\nsympathy for all his emotions. His younger cousin, his junior by several\r\nyears, was attached to him by the tenderest sentiments\u2014secret long\u2014but\r\nthey were now betrothed to each other\u2014a lovely, happy pair. She looked\r\ninquiringly, but he turned away. \u201cNo more of this,\u201d he said, and, giving\r\na swifter impulse to their boat, they speedily reached the shore,\r\nlanded, and walked through the long extent of Chapel Wood. It was dark\r\nnight before they met their carriage at Bishopsgate.\r\n\r\nA week or two after, Horace received letters to call him to a distant\r\npart of the country. A few days before his departure, he requested his\r\ncousin to walk with him. They bent their steps across several meadows to\r\nOld Windsor Churchyard. At first he did not deviate from the usual path;\r\nand as they went they talked cheerfully\u2014gaily. The beauteous sunny day\r\nmight well exhilarate them; the dancing waves sped onwards at their\r\nfeet; the country church lifted its rustic spire into the bright pure\r\nsky. There was nothing in their conversation that could induce his\r\ncousin to think that Neville had led her hither for any saddening\r\npurpose; but when they were about to quit the churchyard, Horace, as if\r\nhe had suddenly recollected himself, turned from the path, crossed the\r\ngreensward, and paused beside a grave near the river. No stone was there\r\nto commemorate the being who reposed beneath\u2014it was thickly grown with\r\ngrass, starred by a luxuriant growth of humble daisies: a few dead\r\nleaves, a broken bramble twig, defaced its neatness. Neville removed\r\nthese, and then said, \u201cJuliet, I commit this sacred spot to your keeping\r\nwhile I am away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no monument,\u201d he continued; \u201cfor her commands were implicitly\r\nobeyed by the two beings to whom she addressed them. One day another may\r\nlie near, and his name will be her epitaph. I do not mean myself,\u201d he\r\nsaid, half-smiling at the terror his cousin\u2019s countenance expressed;\r\n\u201cbut promise me, Juliet, to preserve this grave from every violation. I\r\ndo not wish to sadden you by the story; yet, if I have excited your\r\ninterest, I will satisfy it; but not now\u2014not here.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was not till the following day, when, in company with her sister,\r\nthey again visited Virginia Water, that, seated under the shadow of its\r\npines, whose melodious swinging in the wind breathed unearthly harmony,\r\nNeville, unasked, commenced his story.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was sent to Eton at eleven years of age. I will not dwell upon my\r\nsufferings there; I would hardly refer to them, did they not make a part\r\nof my present narration. I was a fag to a hard taskmaster; every labour\r\nhe could invent\u2014and the youthful tyrant was ingenious\u2014he devised for my\r\nannoyance; early and late, I was forced to be in attendance, to the\r\nneglect of my school duties, so incurring punishment. There were worse\r\nthings to bear than these: it was his delight to put me to shame, and,\r\nfinding that I had too much of my mother in my blood,\u2014to endeavour to\r\ncompel me to acts of cruelty from which my nature revolted,\u2014I refused to\r\nobey. Speak of West Indian slavery! I hope things may be better now; in\r\nmy days, the tender years of aristocratic childhood were yielded up to a\r\ncapricious, unrelenting, cruel bondage, far beyond the measured\r\ndespotism of Jamaica.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne day\u2014I had been two years at school, and was nearly thirteen\u2014my\r\ntyrant, I will give him no other name, issued a command, in the\r\nwantonness of power, for me to destroy a poor little bullfinch I had\r\ntamed and caged. In a hapless hour he found it in my room, and was\r\nindignant that I should dare to appropriate a single pleasure. I\r\nrefused, stubbornly, dauntlessly, though the consequence of my\r\ndisobedience was immediate and terrible. At this moment a message came\r\nfrom my tormentor\u2019s tutor\u2014his father had arrived. \u2018Well, old lad,\u2019 he\r\ncried, \u2018I shall pay you off some day!\u2019 Seizing my pet at the same time,\r\nhe wrung its neck, threw it at my feet, and, with a laugh of derision,\r\nquitted the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever before\u2014never may I again feel the same swelling, boiling fury in\r\nmy bursting heart;\u2014the sight of my nursling expiring at my feet\u2014my\r\ndesire of vengeance\u2014my impotence, created a Vesuvius within me, that no\r\ntears flowed to quench. Could I have uttered\u2014acted\u2014my passion, it would\r\nhave been less torturous: it was so when I burst into a torrent of abuse\r\nand imprecation. My vocabulary\u2014it must have been a choice collection\u2014was\r\nsupplied by him against whom it was levelled. But words were air. I\r\ndesired to give more substantial proof of my resentment\u2014I destroyed\r\neverything in the room belonging to him; I tore them to pieces, I\r\nstamped on them, crushed them with more than childish strength. My last\r\nact was to seize a timepiece, on which my tyrant infinitely prided\r\nhimself, and to dash it to the ground. The sight of this, as it lay\r\nshattered at my feet, recalled me to my senses, and something like an\r\nemotion of fear allayed the tumult in my heart. I began to meditate an\r\nescape: I got out of the house, ran down a lane, and across some\r\nmeadows, far out of bounds, above Eton. I was seen by an elder boy, a\r\nfriend of my tormentor. He called to me, thinking at first that I was\r\nperforming some errand for him; but seeing that I _shirked_, he repeated\r\nhis \u2018_Come up!_\u2019 in an authoritative voice. It put wings to my heels; he\r\ndid not deem it necessary to pursue. But I grow tedious, my dear Juliet;\r\nenough that fears the most intense, of punishment both from my masters\r\nand the upper boys, made me resolve to run away. I reached the banks of\r\nthe Thames, tied my clothes over my head, swam across, and, traversing\r\nseveral fields, entered Windsor Forest, with a vague childish feeling of\r\nbeing able to hide myself for ever in the unexplored obscurity of its\r\nimmeasurable wilds. It was early autumn; the weather was mild, even\r\nwarm; the forest oaks yet showed no sign of winter change, though the\r\nfern beneath wore a yellowy tinge. I got within Chapel Wood; I fed upon\r\nchestnuts and beechnuts; I continued to hide myself from the gamekeepers\r\nand woodmen. I lived thus two days.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut chestnuts and beechnuts were sorry fare to a growing lad of\r\nthirteen years old. A day\u2019s rain occurred, and I began to think myself\r\nthe most unfortunate boy on record. I had a distant, obscure idea of\r\nstarvation: I thought of the Children in the Wood, of their leafy\r\nshroud, gift of the pious robin; this brought my poor bullfinch to my\r\nmind, and tears streamed in torrents down my cheeks. I thought of my\r\nfather and mother; of you, then my little baby cousin and playmate; and\r\nI cried with renewed fervour, till, quite exhausted, I curled myself up\r\nunder a huge oak among some dry leaves, the relics of a hundred summers,\r\nand fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\u201cI ramble on in my narration as if I had a story to tell; yet I have\r\nlittle except a portrait\u2014a sketch\u2014to present, for your amusement or\r\ninterest. When I awoke, the first object that met my opening eyes was a\r\nlittle foot, delicately clad in silk and soft kid. I looked up in\r\ndismay, expecting to behold some gaily dressed appendage to this\r\nindication of high-bred elegance; but I saw a girl, perhaps seventeen,\r\nsimply clad in a dark cotton dress, her face shaded by a large, very\r\ncoarse straw hat; she was pale even to marmoreal whiteness; her\r\nchestnut-coloured hair was parted in plain tresses across a brow which\r\nwore traces of extreme suffering; her eyes were blue, full, large,\r\nmelancholy, often even suffused with tears; but her mouth had an\r\ninfantine sweetness and innocence in its expression, that softened the\r\notherwise sad expression of her countenance.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe spoke to me. I was too hungry, too exhausted, too unhappy, to\r\nresist her kindness, and gladly permitted her to lead me to her home. We\r\npassed out of the wood by some broken palings on to Bishopsgate Heath,\r\nand after no long walk arrived at her habitation. It was a solitary,\r\ndreary-looking cottage; the palings were in disrepair, the garden waste,\r\nthe lattices unadorned by flowers or creepers; within, all was neat, but\r\nsombre, and even mean. The diminutiveness of a cottage requires an\r\nappearance of cheerfulness and elegance to make it pleasing; the bare\r\nfloor,\u2014clean, it is true,\u2014the rush chairs, deal table, checked curtains\r\nof this cot, were beneath even a peasant\u2019s rusticity; yet it was the\r\ndwelling of my lovely guide, whose little white hand, delicately gloved,\r\ncontrasted with her unadorned attire, as did her gentle self with the\r\nclumsy appurtenances of her too humble dwelling.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor child! she had meant entirely to hide her origin, to degrade\r\nherself to a peasant\u2019s state, and little thought that she for ever\r\nbetrayed herself by the strangest incongruities. Thus, the arrangements\r\nof her table were mean, her fare meagre for a hermit; but the linen was\r\nmatchlessly fine, and wax lights stood in candlesticks which a beggar\r\nwould almost have disdained to own. But I talk of circumstances I\r\nobserved afterwards; then I was chiefly aware of the plentiful breakfast\r\nshe caused her single attendant, a young girl, to place before me, and\r\nof the sweet soothing voice of my hostess, which spoke a kindness with\r\nwhich lately I had been little conversant. When my hunger was appeased,\r\nshe drew my story from me, encouraged me to write to my father, and kept\r\nme at her abode till, after a few days, I returned to school pardoned.\r\nNo long time elapsed before I got into the upper forms, and my woful\r\nslavery ended.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhenever I was able, I visited my disguised nymph. I no longer\r\nassociated with my schoolfellows; their diversions, their pursuits\r\nappeared vulgar and stupid to me; I had but one object in view\u2014to\r\naccomplish my lessons, and to steal to the cottage of Ellen Burnet.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not look grave, love! true, others as young as I then was have\r\nloved, and I might also; but not Ellen. Her profound, her intense\r\nmelancholy, sister to despair\u2014her serious, sad discourse\u2014her mind,\r\nestranged from all worldly concerns, forbade that; but there was an\r\nenchantment in her sorrow, a fascination in her converse, that lifted me\r\nabove commonplace existence; she created a magic circle, which I entered\r\nas holy ground: it was not akin to heaven, for grief was the presiding\r\nspirit; but there was an exaltation of sentiment, an enthusiasm, a view\r\nbeyond the grave, which made it unearthly, singular, wild, enthralling.\r\nYou have often observed that I strangely differ from all other men; I\r\nmingle with them, make one in their occupations and diversions, but I\r\nhave a portion of my being sacred from them:\u2014a living well, sealed up\r\nfrom their contamination, lies deep in my heart\u2014it is of little use, but\r\nthere it is; Ellen opened the spring, and it has flowed ever since.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf what did she talk? She recited no past adventures, alluded to no\r\npast intercourse with friend or relative; she spoke of the various woes\r\nthat wait on humanity, on the intricate mazes of life, on the miseries\r\nof passion, of love, remorse, and death, and that which we may hope or\r\nfear beyond the tomb; she spoke of the sensation of wretchedness alive\r\nin her own broken heart, and then she grew fearfully eloquent, till,\r\nsuddenly pausing, she reproached herself for making me familiar with\r\nsuch wordless misery. \u2018I do you harm,\u2019 she often said; \u2018I unfit you for\r\nsociety; I have tried, seeing you thrown upon yonder distorted miniature\r\nof a bad world, to estrange you from its evil contagion; I fear that I\r\nshall be the cause of greater harm to you than could spring from\r\nassociation with your fellow-creatures in the ordinary course of things.\r\nThis is not well\u2014avoid the stricken deer.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were darker shades in the picture than those which I have already\r\ndeveloped. Ellen was more miserable than the imagination of one like\r\nyou, dear girl, unacquainted with woe, can portray. Sometimes she gave\r\nwords to her despair\u2014it was so great as to confuse the boundary between\r\nphysical and mental sensation\u2014and every pulsation of her heart was a\r\nthrob of pain. She has suddenly broken off in talking of her sorrows,\r\nwith a cry of agony\u2014bidding me leave her\u2014hiding her face on her arms,\r\nshivering with the anguish some thought awoke. The idea that chiefly\r\nhaunted her, though she earnestly endeavoured to put it aside, was\r\nself-destruction\u2014to snap the silver cord that bound together so much\r\ngrace, wisdom, and sweetness\u2014to rob the world of a creation made to be\r\nits ornament. Sometimes her piety checked her; oftener a sense of\r\nunendurable suffering made her brood with pleasure over the dread\r\nresolve. She spoke of it to me as being wicked; yet I often fancied this\r\nwas done rather to prevent her example from being of ill effect to me,\r\nthan from any conviction that the Father of all would regard angrily the\r\nlast act of His miserable child. Once she had prepared the mortal\r\nbeverage; it was on the table before her when I entered; she did not\r\ndeny its nature, she did not attempt to justify herself; she only\r\nbesought me not to hate her, and to soothe by my kindness her last\r\nmoments.\u2014\u2018I cannot live!\u2019 was all her explanation, all her excuse; and\r\nit was spoken with such fervent wretchedness that it seemed wrong to\r\nattempt to persuade her to prolong the sense of pain. I did not act like\r\na boy; I wonder I did not; I made one simple request, to which she\r\ninstantly acceded, that she should walk with me to this Belvidere. It\r\nwas a glorious sunset; beauty and the spirit of love breathed in the\r\nwind, and hovered over the softened hues of the landscape. \u2018Look,\r\nEllen,\u2019 I cried, \u2018if only such loveliness of nature existed, it were\r\nworth living for!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018True, if a latent feeling did not blot this glorious scene with murky\r\nshadows. Beauty is as we see it\u2014my eyes view all things deformed and\r\nevil.\u2019 She closed them as she said this; but, young and sensitive, the\r\nvisitings of the soft breeze already began to minister consolation.\r\n\u2018Dearest Ellen,\u2019 I continued, \u2018what do I not owe to you? I am your boy,\r\nyour pupil; I might have gone on blindly as others do, but you opened my\r\neyes; you have given me a sense of the just, the good, the beautiful\u2014and\r\nhave you done this merely for my misfortune? If you leave me, what can\r\nbecome of me?\u2019 The last words came from my heart, and tears gushed from\r\nmy eyes. \u2018Do not leave me, Ellen,\u2019 I said; \u2018I cannot live without\r\nyou\u2014and I cannot die, for I have a mother\u2014a father.\u2019 She turned quickly\r\nround, saying, \u2018You are blessed sufficiently.\u2019 Her voice struck me as\r\nunnatural; she grew deadly pale as she spoke, and was obliged to sit\r\ndown. Still I clung to her, prayed, cried; till she\u2014I had never seen her\r\nshed a tear before\u2014burst into passionate weeping. After this she seemed\r\nto forget her resolve. We returned by moonlight, and our talk was even\r\nmore calm and cheerful than usual. When in her cottage, I poured away\r\nthe fatal draught. Her \u2018good-night\u2019 bore with it no traces of her late\r\nagitation; and the next day she said, \u2018I have thoughtlessly, even\r\nwickedly, created a new duty to myself, even at a time when I had\r\nforsworn all; but I will be true to it. Pardon me for making you\r\nfamiliar with emotions and scenes so dire; I will behave better\u2014I will\r\npreserve myself if I can, till the link between us is loosened, or\r\nbroken, and I am free again.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cOne little incident alone occurred during our intercourse that appeared\r\nat all to connect her with the world. Sometimes I brought her a\r\nnewspaper, for those were stirring times; and though, before I knew her,\r\nshe had forgotten all except the world her own heart enclosed, yet, to\r\nplease me, she would talk of Napoleon\u2014Russia, from whence the emperor\r\nnow returned overthrown\u2014and the prospect of his final defeat. The paper\r\nlay one day on her table; some words caught her eye; she bent eagerly\r\ndown to read them, and her bosom heaved with violent palpitation; but\r\nshe subdued herself, and after a few moments told me to take the paper\r\naway. Then, indeed, I did feel an emotion of even impertinent\r\ninquisitiveness; I found nothing to satisfy it\u2014though afterwards I\r\nbecame aware that it contained a singular advertisement, saying, \u2018If\r\nthese lines meet the eye of any one of the passengers who were on board\r\nthe _St. Mary_, bound for Liverpool from Barbadoes, which sailed on the\r\nthird of May last, and was destroyed by fire in the high seas, a part of\r\nthe crew only having been saved by his Majesty\u2019s frigate the\r\n_Bellerophon_, they are entreated to communicate with the advertiser;\r\nand if any one be acquainted with the particulars of the Hon. Miss\r\nEversham\u2019s fate and present abode, they are earnestly requested to\r\ndisclose them, directing to L. E., Stratton Street, Park Lane.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was after this event, as winter came on, that symptoms of decided\r\nill-health declared themselves in the delicate frame of my poor Ellen. I\r\nhave often suspected that, without positively attempting her life, she\r\ndid many things that tended to abridge it and to produce mortal disease.\r\nNow, when really ill, she refused all medical attendance; but she got\r\nbetter again, and I thought her nearly well when I saw her for the last\r\ntime, before going home for the Christmas holidays. Her manner was full\r\nof affection: she relied, she said, on the continuation of my\r\nfriendship; she made me promise never to forget her, though she refused\r\nto write to me, and forbade any letters from me.\r\n\r\n\u201cEven now I see her standing at her humble doorway. If an appearance of\r\nillness and suffering can ever he termed lovely, it was in her. Still\r\nshe was to be viewed as the wreck of beauty. What must she not have been\r\nin happier days, with her angel expression of face, her nymph-like\r\nfigure, her voice, whose tones were music? \u2018So young\u2014so lost!\u2019 was the\r\nsentiment that burst even from me, a young lad, as I waved my hand to\r\nher as a last adieu. She hardly looked more than fifteen, but none could\r\ndoubt that her very soul was impressed by the sad lines of sorrow that\r\nrested so unceasingly on her fair brow. Away from her, her figure for\r\never floated before my eyes;\u2014I put my hands before them, still she was\r\nthere: my day, my night dreams were filled by my recollections of her.\r\n\r\n\u201cDuring the winter holidays, on a fine soft day, I went out to hunt:\r\nyou, dear Juliet, will remember the sad catastrophe; I fell and broke my\r\nleg. The only person who saw me fall was a young man who rode one of the\r\nmost beautiful horses I ever saw, and I believe it was by watching him\r\nas he took a leap, that I incurred my disaster: he dismounted, and was\r\nat my side in a minute. My own animal had fled; he called his; it obeyed\r\nhis voice; with ease he lifted my light figure on to the saddle,\r\ncontriving to support my leg, and so conducted me a short distance to a\r\nlodge situated in the woody recesses of Elmore Park, the seat of the\r\nEarl of D\u2014\u2014, whose second son my preserver was. He was my sole nurse for\r\na day or two, and during the whole of my illness passed many hours of\r\neach day by my bedside. As I lay gazing on him, while he read to me, or\r\ntalked, narrating a thousand stranger adventures which had occurred\r\nduring his service in the Peninsula, I thought\u2014is it for ever to be my\r\nfate to fall in with the highly gifted and excessively unhappy?\r\n\r\n\u201cThe immediate neighbour of Lewis\u2019 family was Lord Eversham. He had\r\nmarried in very early youth, and became a widower young. After this\r\nmisfortune, which passed like a deadly blight over his prospects and\r\npossessions, leaving the gay view utterly sterile and bare, he left his\r\nsurviving infant daughter under the care of Lewis\u2019 mother, and travelled\r\nfor many years in far distant lands. He returned when Clarice was about\r\nten, a lovely sweet child, the pride and delight of all connected with\r\nher. Lord Eversham, on his return\u2014he was then hardly more than\r\nthirty\u2014devoted himself to her education. They were never separate: he\r\nwas a good musician, and she became a proficient under his tutoring.\r\nThey rode\u2014walked\u2014read together. When a father is all that a father may\r\nbe, the sentiments of filial piety, entire dependence, and perfect\r\nconfidence being united, the love of a daughter is one of the deepest\r\nand strongest, as it is the purest passion of which our natures are\r\ncapable. Clarice worshipped her parent, who came, during the transition\r\nfrom mere childhood to the period when reflection and observation\r\nawaken, to adorn a commonplace existence with all the brilliant adjuncts\r\nwhich enlightened and devoted affection can bestow. He appeared to her\r\nlike an especial gift of Providence, a guardian angel\u2014but far dearer, as\r\nbeing akin to her own nature. She grew, under his eye, in loveliness and\r\nrefinement both of intellect and heart. These feelings were not\r\ndivided\u2014almost strengthened, by the engagement that had taken place\r\nbetween her and Lewis:\u2014Lewis was destined for the army, and, after a few\r\nyears\u2019 service, they were to be united.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is hard, when all is fair and tranquil, when the world, opening\r\nbefore the ardent gaze of youth, looks like a well-kept demesne,\r\nunencumbered by let or hindrance for the annoyance of the young\r\ntraveller, that we should voluntarily stray into desert wilds and\r\ntempest-visited districts. Lewis Elmore was ordered to Spain; and, at\r\nthe same time, Lord Eversham found it necessary to visit some estates he\r\npossessed in Barbadoes. He was not sorry to revisit a scene, which had\r\ndwelt in his memory as an earthly paradise, nor to show to his daughter\r\na new and strange world, so to form her understanding and enlarge her\r\nmind. They were to return in three months, and departed as on a summer\r\ntour. Clarice was glad that, while her lover gathered experience and\r\nknowledge in a distant land, she should not remain in idleness; she was\r\nglad that there would be some diversion for her anxiety during his\r\nperilous absence; and in every way she enjoyed the idea of travelling\r\nwith her beloved father, who would fill every hour, and adorn every new\r\nscene, with pleasure and delight. They sailed. Clarice wrote home, with\r\nenthusiastic expressions of rapture and delight, from Madeira:\u2014yet,\r\nwithout her father, she said, the fair scene had been blank to her. More\r\nthan half her letter was filled by the expressions of her gratitude and\r\naffection for her adored and revered parent. While he, in his, with\r\nfewer words, perhaps, but with no less energy, spoke of his satisfaction\r\nin her improvement, his pride in her beauty, and his grateful sense of\r\nher love and kindness.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuch were they, a matchless example of happiness in the dearest\r\nconnection in life, as resulting from the exercise of their reciprocal\r\nduties and affections. A father and daughter; the one all care,\r\ngentleness, and sympathy, consecrating his life for her happiness; the\r\nother fond, duteous, grateful:\u2014such had they been,\u2014and where were they\r\nnow,\u2014the noble, kind, respected parent, and the beloved and loving\r\nchild! They had departed from England as on a pleasure voyage down an\r\ninland stream; but the ruthless car of destiny had overtaken them on\r\ntheir unsuspecting way, crushing them under its heavy wheels\u2014scattering\r\nlove, hope, and joy as the bellowing avalanche overwhelms and grinds to\r\nmere spray the streamlet of the valley. They were gone; but whither?\r\nMystery hung over the fate of the most helpless victim; and my friend\u2019s\r\nanxiety was, to penetrate the clouds that hid poor Clarice from his\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter an absence of a few months, they had written, fixing their\r\ndeparture in the _St. Mary_, to sail from Barbadoes in a few days.\r\nLewis, at the same time, returned from Spain: he was invalided, in his\r\nvery first action, by a bad wound in his side. He arrived, and each day\r\nexpected to hear of the landing of his friends, when that common\r\nmessenger, the newspaper, brought him tidings to fill him with more than\r\nanxiety\u2014with fear and agonizing doubt. The _St. Mary_ had caught fire,\r\nand had burned in the open sea. A frigate, the _Bellerophon_, had saved\r\na part of the crew. In spite of illness and a physician\u2019s commands,\r\nLewis set out the same day for London to ascertain as speedily as\r\npossible the fate of her he loved. There he heard that the frigate was\r\nexpected in the Downs. Without alighting from his travelling chaise, he\r\nposted thither, arriving in a burning fever. He went on board, saw the\r\ncommander, and spoke with the crew. They could give him few particulars\r\nas to whom they had saved; they had touched at Liverpool, and left there\r\nmost of the persons, including all the passengers rescued from the _St.\r\nMary_. Physical suffering for awhile disabled Mr. Elmore; he was\r\nconfined by his wound and consequent fever, and only recovered to give\r\nhimself up to his exertions to discover the fate of his friends;\u2014they\r\ndid not appear nor write; and all Lewis\u2019 inquiries only tended to\r\nconfirm his worst fears; yet still he hoped, and still continued\r\nindefatigable in his perquisitions. He visited Liverpool and Ireland,\r\nwhither some of the passengers had gone, and learnt only scattered,\r\nincongruous details of the fearful tragedy, that told nothing of Miss\r\nEversham\u2019s present abode, though much that confirmed his suspicion that\r\nshe still lived.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe fire on board the _St. Mary_ had raged long and fearfully before\r\nthe _Bellerophon_ hove in sight, and boats came off for the rescue of\r\nthe crew. The women were to be first embarked; but Clarice clung to her\r\nfather, and refused to go till he should accompany her. Some fearful\r\npresentiment that, if she were saved, he would remain and die, gave such\r\nenergy to her resolve, that not the entreaties of her father, nor the\r\nangry expostulations of the captain, could shake it. Lewis saw this man,\r\nafter the lapse of two or three months, and he threw most light on the\r\ndark scene. He well remembered that, transported with anger by her\r\nobstinacy, he had said to her, \u2018You will cause your father\u2019s death\u2014and\r\nbe as much a parricide as if you put poison into his cup; you are not\r\nthe first girl who has murdered her father in her wilful mood.\u2019 Still\r\nClarice passionately refused to go\u2014there was no time for long parley\u2014the\r\npoint was yielded, and she remained pale, but firm, near her parent,\r\nwhose arm was around her, supporting her during the awful interval. It\r\nwas no period for regular action and calm order; a tempest was rising,\r\nthe scorching waves blew this way and that, making a fearful day of the\r\nnight which veiled all except the burning ship. The boats returned with\r\ndifficulty, and one only could contrive to approach; it was nearly full;\r\nLord Eversham and his daughter advanced to the deck\u2019s edge to get in.\r\n\u2018We can only take one of you,\u2019 vociferated the sailors; \u2018keep back on\r\nyour life! throw the girl to us\u2014we will come back for you if we can.\u2019\r\nLord Eversham cast with a strong arm his daughter, who had now entirely\r\nlost her self-possession, into the boat; she was alive again in a\r\nminute; she called to her father, held out her arms to him, and would\r\nhave thrown herself into the sea, but was held back by the sailors.\r\nMeanwhile Lord Eversham, feeling that no boat could again approach the\r\nlost vessel, contrived to heave a spar overboard, and threw himself into\r\nthe sea, clinging to it. The boat, tossed by the huge waves, with\r\ndifficulty made its way to the frigate; and as it rose from the trough\r\nof the sea, Clarice saw her father struggling with his fate\u2014battling\r\nwith the death that at last became the victor; the spar floated by, his\r\narms had fallen from it; were those his pallid features? She neither\r\nwept nor fainted, but her limbs grew rigid, her face colourless, and she\r\nwas lifted as a log on to the deck of the frigate.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe captain allowed that on her homeward voyage the people had rather a\r\nhorror of her, as having caused her father\u2019s death; her own servants had\r\nperished, few people remembered who she was; but they talked together\r\nwith no careful voices as they passed her, and a hundred times she must\r\nhave heard herself accused of having destroyed her parent. She spoke to\r\nno one, or only in brief reply when addressed; to avoid the rough\r\nremonstrances of those around, she appeared at table, ate as well as she\r\ncould; but there was a settled wretchedness in her face that never\r\nchanged. When they landed at Liverpool, the captain conducted her to an\r\nhotel; he left her, meaning to return, but an opportunity of sailing\r\nthat night for the Downs occurred, of which he availed himself, without\r\nagain visiting her. He knew, he said, and truly, that she was in her\r\nnative country, where she had but to write a letter to gather crowds of\r\nfriends about her; and where can greater civility be found than at an\r\nEnglish hotel, if it is known that you are perfectly able to pay your\r\nbill?\r\n\r\n\u201cThis was all that Mr. Elmore could learn, and it took many months to\r\ngather together these few particulars. He went to the hotel at\r\nLiverpool. It seemed that as soon as there appeared some hope of rescue\r\nfrom the frigate, Lord Eversham had given his pocket-book to his\r\ndaughter\u2019s care, containing bills on a banking-house at Liverpool to the\r\namount of a few hundred pounds. On the second day after Clarice\u2019s\r\narrival there, she had sent for the master of the hotel, and showed him\r\nthese. He got the cash for her; and the next day she quitted Liverpool\r\nin a little coasting vessel. In vain Lewis endeavoured to trace her.\r\nApparently she had crossed to Ireland; but whatever she had done,\r\nwherever she had gone, she had taken infinite pains to conceal herself,\r\nand all due was speedily lost.\r\n\r\n\u201cLewis had not yet despaired; he was even now perpetually making\r\njourneys, sending emissaries, employing every possible means for her\r\ndiscovery. From the moment he told me this story, we talked of nothing\r\nelse. I became deeply interested, and we ceaselessly discussed the\r\nprobabilities of the case, and where she might be concealed. That she\r\ndid not meditate suicide was evident from her having possessed herself\r\nof money; yet, unused to the world, young, lovely, and inexperienced,\r\nwhat could be her plan? What might not have been her fate?\r\n\r\n\u201cMeanwhile I continued for nearly three months confined by the fracture\r\nof my limb; before the lapse of that time, I had begun to crawl about\r\nthe ground, and now I considered myself as nearly recovered. It had been\r\nsettled that I should not return to Eton, but be entered at Oxford; and\r\nthis leap from boyhood to man\u2019s estate elated me considerably. Yet still\r\nI thought of my poor Ellen, and was angry at her obstinate silence. Once\r\nor twice I had, disobeying her command, written to her, mentioning my\r\naccident, and the kind attentions of Mr. Elmore. Still she wrote not;\r\nand I began to fear that her illness might have had a fatal termination.\r\nShe had made me vow so solemnly never to mention her name, never to\r\ninquire about her during my absence, that, considering obedience the\r\nfirst duty of a young inexperienced boy to one older than himself, I\r\nresisted each suggestion of my affection or my fears to transgress her\r\norders.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now spring came, with its gift of opening buds, odoriferous\r\nflowers, and sunny genial days. I returned home, and found my family on\r\nthe eve of their departure for London; my long confinement had weakened\r\nme; it was deemed inadvisable for me to encounter the bad air and\r\nfatigues of the metropolis, and I remained to rusticate. I rode and\r\nhunted, and thought of Ellen; missing the excitement of her\r\nconversation, and feeling a vacancy in my heart which she had filled. I\r\nbegan to think of riding across the country from Shropshire to Berks for\r\nthe purpose of seeing her. The whole landscape haunted my\r\nimagination\u2014the fields round Eton\u2014the silver Thames\u2014the majestic\r\nforest\u2014this lovely scene of Virginia Water\u2014the heath and her desolate\r\ncottage\u2014she herself pale, slightly bending from weakness of health,\r\nawakening from dark abstraction to bestow on me a kind smile of welcome.\r\nIt grew into a passionate desire of my heart to behold her, to cheer her\r\nas I might by my affectionate attentions, to hear her, and to hang upon\r\nher accents of inconsolable despair as if it had been celestial harmony.\r\nAs I meditated on these things, a voice seemed for ever to repeat, Now\r\ngo, or it will be too late; while another yet more mournful tone\r\nresponded, You can never see her more!\r\n\r\n\u201cI was occupied by these thoughts, as, on a summer moonlight night, I\r\nloitered in the shrubbery, unable to quit a scene of entrancing beauty,\r\nwhen I was startled at hearing myself called by Mr. Elmore. He came on\r\nhis way to the coast; he had received a letter from Ireland, which made\r\nhim think that Miss Eversham was residing near Enniscorthy,\u2014a strange\r\nplace for her to select, but as concealment was evidently her object,\r\nnot an improbable one. Yet his hopes were not high; on the contrary, he\r\nperformed this journey more from the resolve to leave nothing undone,\r\nthan in expectation of a happy result. He asked me if I would accompany\r\nhim; I was delighted with the offer, and we departed together on the\r\nfollowing morning.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe arrived at Milford Haven, where we were to take our passage. The\r\npacket was to sail early in the morning\u2014we walked on the beach, and\r\nbeguiled the time by talk. I had never mentioned Ellen to Lewis; I felt\r\nnow strongly inclined to break my vow, and to relate my whole adventure\r\nwith her; but restrained myself, and we spoke only of the unhappy\r\nClarice\u2014of the despair that must have been hers, of her remorse and\r\nunavailing regret.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe retired to rest; and early in the morning I was called to prepare\r\nfor going on board. I got ready, and then knocked at Lewis\u2019 door; he\r\nadmitted me, for he was dressed, though a few of his things were still\r\nunpacked, and scattered about the room. The morocco case of a miniature\r\nwas on his table; I took it up. \u2018Did I never show you that?\u2019 said\r\nElmore; \u2018poor dear Clarice! she was very happy when that was painted!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI opened it;\u2014rich, luxuriant curls clustered on her brow and the\r\nsnow-white throat; there was a light zephyr appearance in the figure; an\r\nexpression of unalloyed exuberant happiness in the countenance; but\r\nthose large dove\u2019s eyes, the innocence that dwelt on her mouth, could\r\nnot be mistaken, and the name of Ellen Burnet burst from my lips.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was no doubt: why had I ever doubted? the thing was so plain! Who\r\nbut the survivor of such a parent, and she the apparent cause of his\r\ndeath, could be so miserable as Ellen? A torrent of explanation\r\nfollowed, and a thousand minute circumstances, forgotten before, now\r\nassured us that my sad hermitess was the beloved of Elmore. No more sea\r\nvoyage\u2014not a second of delay\u2014our chaise, the horses\u2019 heads tamed to the\r\neast, rolled on with lightning rapidity, yet far too slowly to satisfy\r\nour impatience. It was not until we arrived at Worcester that the tide\r\nof expectation, flowing all one way, ebbed. Suddenly, even while I was\r\ntelling Elmore some anecdote to prove that, in spite of all, she would\r\nbe accessible to consolation, I remembered her ill-health and my fears.\r\nLewis saw the change my countenance underwent; for some time I could not\r\ncommand my voice; and when at last I spoke, my gloomy anticipations\r\npassed like an electric shock into my friend\u2019s soul.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen we arrived at Oxford we halted for an hour or two, unable to\r\nproceed; yet we did not converse on the subject so near our hearts, nor\r\nuntil we arrived in sight of Windsor did a word pass between us; then\r\nElmore said, \u2018To-morrow morning, dear Neville, you shall visit Clarice;\r\nwe must not be too precipitate.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe morrow came. I arose with that intolerable weight at my breast,\r\nwhich it is grief\u2019s worst heritage to feel. A sunny day it was; yet the\r\natmosphere looked black to me; my heart was dead within me. We sat at\r\nthe breakfast-table, but neither ate, and after some restless\r\nindecision, we left our inn, and (to protract the interval) walked to\r\nBishopsgate. Our conversation belied our feelings: we spoke as if we\r\nexpected all to be well; we felt that there was no hope. We crossed the\r\nheath along the accustomed path. On one side was the luxuriant foliage\r\nof the forest, on the other the widespread moor; her cottage was\r\nsituated at one extremity, and could hardly be distinguished, until we\r\nshould arrive close to it. When we drew near, Lewis bade me go on alone;\r\nhe would wait my return. I obeyed, and reluctantly approached the\r\nconfirmation of my fears. At length it stood before me, the lonely cot\r\nand desolate garden; the unfastened wicket swung in the breeze; every\r\nshutter was closed.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo stand motionless and gaze on these symbols of my worst forebodings\r\nwas all that I could do. My heart seemed to me to call aloud for\r\nEllen,\u2014for such was she to me,\u2014her other name might be a fiction\u2014but\r\nsilent as her own life-deserted lips were mine. Lewis grew impatient,\r\nand advanced. My stay had occasioned a transient ray of hope to enter\r\nhis mind; it vanished when he saw me and _her_ deserted dwelling. Slowly\r\nwe turned away, and were directing our steps back again, when my name\r\nwas called by a child. A little girl came running across some fields\r\ntowards us, whom at last I recognised as having seen before with Ellen.\r\n\u2018Mr. Neville, there is a letter for you!\u2019 cried the child. \u2018A letter;\r\nwhere?\u2014who?\u2019 \u2018The lady left a letter for you. You must go to Old\r\nWindsor, to Mr. Cooke\u2019s; he has got it for you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cShe had left a letter: was she then departed on an earthly journey? \u2018I\r\nwill go for it immediately. Mr. Cooke! Old Windsor! where shall I find\r\nhim? who is he?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, sir, everybody knows him,\u2019 said the child; \u2018he lives close to the\r\nchurchyard; he is the sexton. After the burial, Nancy gave him the\r\nletter to take care of.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHad we hoped? had we for a moment indulged the expectation of ever\r\nagain seeing our miserable friend? Never! O never! Our hearts had told\r\nus that the sufferer was at peace\u2014the unhappy orphan with her father in\r\nthe abode of spirits! Why, then, were we here? Why had a smile dwelt on\r\nour lips, now wreathed into the expression of anguish? Our full hearts\r\ndemanded one consolation\u2014to weep upon her grave; her sole link now with\r\nus, her mourners. There at last my boy\u2019s grief found vent in tears, in\r\nlamentation. You saw the spot; the grassy mound rests lightly on the\r\nbosom of fair Clarice, of my own poor Ellen. Stretched upon this,\r\nkissing the scarcely springing turf; for many hours no thought visited\r\nme but the wretched one, that she had lived, and was lost to me for\r\never!\r\n\r\n\u201cIf Lewis had ever doubted the identity of my friend with her he loved,\r\nthe letter put into our hands undeceived him; the handwriting was Miss\r\nEversham\u2019s, it was directed to me, and contained words like these:\u2014\r\n\r\n                                                           \u201c\u2018_April 11_.\r\n\r\n    \u201c\u2018I have vowed never to mention certain beloved names, never to\r\n    communicate with beings who cherished me once, to whom my deepest\r\n    gratitude is due; and, as well as poor bankrupt can, is paid.\r\n    Perhaps it is a mere prevarication to write to you, dear Horace,\r\n    concerning them; but Heaven pardon me! my disrobed spirit would not\r\n    repose, I fear, if I did not thus imperfectly bid them a last\r\n    farewell.\r\n\r\n    \u201c\u2018You know him, Neville; and know that he for ever laments her whom\r\n    he has lost. Describe your poor Ellen to him, and he will speedily\r\n    see that _she_ died on the waves of the murderous Atlantic. Ellen\r\n    had nothing in common with _her_, save love for, and interest in\r\n    him. Tell him it had been well for him, perhaps, to have united\r\n    himself to the child of prosperity, the nursling of deep love; but\r\n    it had been destruction, even could he have meditated such an act,\r\n    to wed the parrici\u2014.\r\n\r\n    \u201c\u2018I will not write that word. Sickness and near death have taken the\r\n    sting from my despair. The agony of woe which you witnessed is\r\n    melted into tender affliction and pious hope. I am not miserable\r\n    now. Now! When you read these words, the hand that writes, the eye\r\n    that sees, will be a little dust, becoming one with the earth around\r\n    it. You, perhaps he, will visit my quiet retreat, bestow a few tears\r\n    on my fate, but let them be secret; they may make green my grave,\r\n    but do not let a misplaced feeling adorn it with any other tribute.\r\n    It is my last request; let no stone, no name, mark that spot.\r\n\r\n    \u201c\u2018Farewell, dear Horace! Farewell to one other whom I may not name.\r\n    May the God to whom I am about to resign my spirit in confidence and\r\n    hope, bless your earthly career! Blindly, perhaps, you will regret\r\n    me for your own sakes; but for mine, you will be grateful to the\r\n    Providence which has snapt the heavy chain binding me to unutterable\r\n    sorrow, and which permits me from my lowly grass-grown tomb to say\r\n    to you, I am at peace.\r\n\r\n                                                              \u201c\u2018ELLEN.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI.\r\n\r\n                           _THE FALSE RHYME._\r\n\r\n                 \u201cCome, tell me where the maid is found\r\n                    Whose heart can love without deceit,\r\n                  And I will range the world around\r\n                    To sigh one moment at her feet.\u201d\r\n                                \u2014MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nON a fine July day, the fair Margaret, Queen of Navarre, then on a visit\r\nto her royal brother, had arranged a rural feast for the morning\r\nfollowing, which Francis declined attending. He was melancholy; and the\r\ncause was said to be some lover\u2019s quarrel with a favourite dame. The\r\nmorrow came, and dark rain and murky clouds destroyed at once the\r\nschemes of the courtly throng. Margaret was angry, and she grew weary:\r\nher only hope for amusement was in Francis, and he had shut himself\r\nup,\u2014an excellent reason why she should the more desire to see him. She\r\nentered his apartment: he was standing at the casement, against which\r\nthe noisy shower beat, writing with a diamond on the glass. Two\r\nbeautiful dogs were his sole companions. As Queen Margaret entered, he\r\nhastily let down the silken curtain before the window, and looked a\r\nlittle confused.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat treason is this, my liege,\u201d said the queen, \u201cwhich crimsons your\r\ncheek? I must see the same.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is treason,\u201d replied the king, \u201cand therefore, sweet sister, thou\r\nmayest not see it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis the more excited Margaret\u2019s curiosity, and a playful contest\r\nensued. Francis at last yielded: he threw himself on a huge high-backed\r\nsettee; and as the lady drew back the curtain with an arch smile, he\r\ngrew grave and sentimental, as he reflected on the cause which had\r\ninspired his libel against all womankind.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have we here?\u201d cried Margaret; \u201cnay, this is l\u00ease majest\u00e9\u2014\r\n\r\n                        \u201c\u2018Souvent femme varie,\r\n                          Bien fou qui s\u2019y fie!\u2019\r\n\r\nVery little change would greatly amend your couplet:\u2014would it not run\r\nbetter thus\u2014\r\n\r\n                       \u201c\u2018Souvent homme varie,\r\n                         Bien folle qui s\u2019y fie?\u2019\r\n\r\nI could tell you twenty stories of man\u2019s inconstancy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will be content with one true tale of woman\u2019s fidelity,\u201d said Francis\r\ndrily; \u201cbut do not provoke me. I would fain be at peace with the soft\r\nMutabilities, for thy dear sake.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI defy your grace,\u201d replied Margaret rashly, \u201cto instance the falsehood\r\nof one noble and well-reputed dame.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot even Emilie de Lagny?\u201d asked the king.\r\n\r\nThis was a sore subject for the queen. Emilie had been brought up in her\r\nown household, the most beautiful and the most virtuous of her maids of\r\nhonour. She had long loved the Sire de Lagny, and their nuptials were\r\ncelebrated with rejoicings but little ominous of the result. De Lagny\r\nwas accused but a year after of traitorously yielding to the emperor a\r\nfortress under his command, and he was condemned to perpetual\r\nimprisonment. For some time Emilie seemed inconsolable, often visiting\r\nthe miserable dungeon of her husband, and suffering on her return, from\r\nwitnessing his wretchedness, such paroxysms of grief as threatened her\r\nlife. Suddenly, in the midst of her sorrow, she disappeared; and inquiry\r\nonly divulged the disgraceful fact, that she had escaped from France,\r\nbearing her jewels with her, and accompanied by her page, Robinet\r\nLeroux. It was whispered that, during their journey, the lady and the\r\nstripling often occupied one chamber; and Margaret, enraged at these\r\ndiscoveries, commanded that no further quest should be made for her lost\r\nfavourite.\r\n\r\nTaunted now by her brother, she defended Emilie, declaring that she\r\nbelieved her to be guiltless, even going so far as to boast that within\r\na month she would bring proof of her innocence.\r\n\r\n\u201cRobinet was a pretty boy,\u201d said Francis, laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us make a bet,\u201d cried Margaret: \u201cif I lose, I will bear this vile\r\nrhyme of thine as a motto to my shame to my grave; if I win\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI will break my window, and grant thee whatever boon thou askest.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe result of this bet was long sung by troubadour and minstrel. The\r\nqueen employed a hundred emissaries,\u2014published rewards for any\r\nintelligence of Emilie,\u2014all in vain. The month was expiring, and\r\nMargaret would have given many bright jewels to redeem her word. On the\r\neve of the fatal day, the jailor of the prison in which the Sire de\r\nLagny was confined sought an audience of the queen; he brought her a\r\nmessage from the knight to say, that if the Lady Margaret would ask his\r\npardon as her boon, and obtain from her royal brother that he might be\r\nbrought before him, her bet was won. Fair Margaret was very joyful, and\r\nreadily made the desired promise. Francis was unwilling to see his false\r\nservant, but he was in high good-humour, for a cavalier had that morning\r\nbrought intelligence of a victory over the Imperialists. The messenger\r\nhimself was lauded in the despatches as the most fearless and bravest\r\nknight in France. The king loaded him with presents, only regretting\r\nthat a vow prevented the soldier from raising his visor or declaring his\r\nname.\r\n\r\nThat same evening as the setting sun shone on the lattice on which the\r\nungallant rhyme was traced, Francis reposed on the same settee, and the\r\nbeautiful Queen of Navarre, with triumph in her bright eyes, sat beside\r\nhim. Attended by guards, the prisoner was brought in: his frame was\r\nattenuated by privation, and he walked with tottering steps. He knelt at\r\nthe feet of Francis, and uncovered his head; a quantity of rich golden\r\nhair then escaping, fell over the sunken cheeks and pallid brow of the\r\nsuppliant.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have treason here!\u201d cried the king. \u201cSir jailor, where is your\r\nprisoner!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSire, blame him not,\u201d said the soft faltering voice of Emilie; \u201cwiser\r\nmen than he have been deceived by woman. My dear lord was guiltless of\r\nthe crime for which he suffered. There was but one mode to save him:\u2014I\r\nassumed his chains\u2014he escaped with poor Robinet Leroux in my attire\u2014he\r\njoined your army: the young and gallant cavalier who delivered the\r\ndespatches to your grace, whom you overwhelmed with honours and reward,\r\nis my own Enguerrard de Lagny. I waited but for his arrival with\r\ntestimonials of his innocence, to declare myself to my lady, the queen.\r\nHas she not won her bet! And the boon she asks\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cIs de Lagny\u2019s pardon,\u201d said Margaret, as she also knelt to the king.\r\n\u201cSpare your faithful vassal, sire, and reward this lady\u2019s truth.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrancis first broke the false-speaking window, then he raised the ladies\r\nfrom their supplicatory posture.\r\n\r\nIn the tournament given to celebrate this \u201cTriumph of Ladies,\u201d the Sire\r\nde Lagny bore off every prize; and surely there was more loveliness in\r\nEmilie\u2019s faded cheek\u2014more grace in her emaciated form, type as they were\r\nof truest affection\u2014than in the prouder bearing and fresher complexion\r\nof the most brilliant beauty in attendance on the courtly festival.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII.\r\n\r\n          _A TALE OF THE PASSIONS; OR, THE DEATH OF DESPINA._\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER the death of Manfred, King of Naples, the Ghibellines lost their\r\nascendency throughout Italy. The exiled Guelphs returned to their native\r\ncities; and, not contented with resuming the reins of government, they\r\nprosecuted their triumph until the Ghibellines in their turn were\r\nobliged to fly, and to mourn in banishment over the violent party spirit\r\nwhich had before occasioned their bloody victories, and now their\r\nirretrievable defeat. After an obstinate contest, the Florentine\r\nGhibellines were forced to quit their native town; their estates were\r\nconfiscated; their attempts to reinstate themselves frustrated; and\r\nreceding from castle to castle, they at length took refuge in Lucca, and\r\nawaited with impatience the arrival of Corradino from Germany, through\r\nwhose influence they hoped again to establish the Imperial supremacy.\r\n\r\nThe first of May was ever a day of rejoicing and festivity at Florence.\r\nThe youth of both sexes, and of all ranks, paraded the streets, crowned\r\nwith flowers, and singing the canzonets of the day. In the evening they\r\nassembled in the _Piazza del Duomo_, and spent the hours in dancing. The\r\n_Carroccio_ was led through the principal streets, the ringing of its\r\nbell drowned in the peals that rang from every belfry in the city, and\r\nin the music of fifes and drums which made a part of the procession that\r\nfollowed it. The triumph of the reigning party in Florence caused them\r\nto celebrate the anniversary of the first of May, 1268, with peculiar\r\nsplendour. They had indeed hoped that Charles d\u2019Anjou, King of Naples,\r\nthe head of the Guelphs in Italy, and then _Vicare_ (President) of their\r\nrepublic, would have been there to adorn the festival by his presence.\r\nBut the expectation of Corradino had caused the greater part of his\r\nnewly-conquered and oppressed kingdom to revolt, and he had hastily\r\nquitted Tuscany to secure by his presence those conquests of which his\r\navarice and cruelty endangered the loss. But although Charles somewhat\r\nfeared the approaching contest with Corradino, the Florentine Guelphs,\r\nnewly reinstated in their city and possessions, did not permit a fear to\r\ncloud their triumph. The principal families vied with each other in the\r\ndisplay of their magnificence during the festival. The knights followed\r\nthe _Carroccio_ on horseback, and the windows were filled with ladies\r\nwho leant upon gold-inwoven carpets, while their own dresses, at once\r\nsimple and elegant, their only ornaments, flowers, contrasted with the\r\nglittering tapestry and the brilliant colours of the flags of the\r\nvarious communities. The whole population of Florence poured into the\r\nprincipal streets, and none were left at home, except the decrepit and\r\nsick, unless it were some discontented Ghibelline, whose fear, poverty,\r\nor avarice had caused him to conceal his party when it had been banished\r\nfrom the city.\r\n\r\nIt was not the feeling of discontent which prevented Monna Gegia de\u2019\r\nBecari from being among the first of the revellers; and she looked\r\nangrily on what she called her \u201cGhibelline leg,\u201d which fixed her to her\r\nchair on such a day of triumph. The sun shone in all its glory in an\r\nunclouded sky, and caused the fair Florentines to draw their _fazioles_\r\n(veils) over their dark eyes, and to bereave the youth of those beams\r\nmore vivifying than the sun\u2019s rays. The same sun poured its full light\r\ninto the lonely apartment of Monna Gegia, and almost extinguished the\r\nfire which was lighted in the middle of the room, over which hung the\r\npot of _minestra_, the dinner of the dame and her husband. But she had\r\ndeserted the fire, and was seated by her window, holding her beads in\r\nher hand, while every now and then she peeped from her lattice (five\r\nstoreys high) into the narrow lane below; but no creature passed. She\r\nlooked at the opposite window; a cat slept there beside a pot of\r\nheliotrope, but no human being was heard or seen,\u2014they had all gone to\r\nthe _Piazza del Duomo_.\r\n\r\nMonna Gegia was an old woman, and her dress of green _calrasio_ (stuff)\r\nshowed that she belonged to one of the _Arli Minori_ (working classes).\r\nHer head was covered by a red kerchief, which, folded triangularly, hung\r\nloosely over it; her grey hairs were combed back from her high and\r\nwrinkled brow. The quickness of her eye spoke the activity of her mind,\r\nand the slight irritability that lingered about the corners of her lips\r\nmight be occasioned by the continual war maintained between her bodily\r\nand mental faculties. \u201cNow, by St. John!\u201d she said, \u201cI would give my\r\ngold cross to make one of them; though by giving that I should appear on\r\na _festa_, without that which no _festa_ yet ever found me wanting.\u201d And\r\nas she spoke she looked with great complacency on a large but thin gold\r\ncross which was tied round her withered neck by a ribbon, once black,\r\nnow of a rusty brown. \u201cMethinks this leg of mine is bewitched; and it\r\nmay well be that my Ghibelline husband has used the black art to hinder\r\nme from following the _Carroccio_ with the best of them.\u201d\u2014A slight\r\nsound, as of footsteps in the street far below, interrupted the good\r\nwoman\u2019s soliloquy.\u2014\u201cPerhaps it is Monna Lisabetta, or Messer Giani dei\r\nAgli, the weaver, who mounted the breach first when the castle of\r\nPagibonzi was taken.\u201d\u2014She looked down, but could see no one, and was\r\nabout to relapse into her old train of thoughts, when her attention was\r\nagain attracted by the sound of steps ascending the stairs: they were\r\nslow and heavy, but she did not doubt who her visitant was when a key\r\nwas applied to the hole of the door; the latch was lifted up, and a\r\nmoment after, with an unassured mien and downcast eyes, her husband\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nHe was a short, stunted man, more than sixty years of age; his shoulders\r\nwere broad and high; his lank hair was still coal-black; his brows were\r\noverhanging and bushy; his eyes black and quick; his lips as it were\r\ncontradicted the sternness of the upper part of his face, for their\r\ngentle curve betokened even delicacy of sentiment, and his smile was\r\ninexpressibly sweet. He had on a low-crowned, red cloth cap, which he\r\ndrew over his eyes, and, seating himself on a low bench by the fire, he\r\nheaved a deep sigh. He appeared disinclined to enter into any\r\nconversation, but Monna Gegia was resolved that he should not enjoy his\r\nmelancholy mood uninterrupted.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you been to mass, Cincolo?\u201d she asked, beginning by a question\r\nsufficiently removed from the point she longed to approach.\u2014He shrugged\r\nhis shoulders uneasily, but did not reply.\u2014\u201cYou are too early for your\r\ndinner,\u201d continued Gegia; \u201cdo you not go out again?\u201d\r\n\r\nCincolo answered \u201cNo!\u201d in an accent that denoted his disinclination to\r\nfurther questioning. But this very impatience only served to feed the\r\nspirit of contention that was fermenting in the bosom of Gegia.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are not used,\u201d she said, \u201cto pass your May days under your\r\nchimney.\u201d\u2014No answer.\u2014\u201cWell,\u201d she continued, \u201cif you will not speak, I\r\nhave done!\u201d\u2014meaning that she intended to begin\u2014\u201cbut by that lengthened\r\nface of thine I see that some good news is stirring abroad, and I bless\r\nthe Virgin for it, whatever it may be. Come, tell me what happy tidings\r\nmake thee so woe-begone.\u201d\r\n\r\nCincolo remained silent for awhile, then turning half round, but not\r\nlooking at his wife, he replied, \u201cWhat if old Marzio the lion be dead?\u201d\r\n\r\nGegia turned pale at the idea, but a smile that lurked in the\r\ngood-natured mouth of her husband reassured her.\r\n\r\n\u201cNay, St. John defend us!\u201d she began, \u201cbut that is not true. Old\r\nMarzio\u2019s death would not drive you within these four walls, except it\r\nwere to triumph over your old wife. By the blessing of St. John, not one\r\nof our lions have died since the eve of the battle of Monte Aperto; and\r\nI doubt not that they were poisoned; for Mari, who fed them that night,\r\nwas more than half a Ghibelline in his heart. Besides, the bells are\r\nstill ringing, and the drums still beating, and all would be silent\r\nenough if old Marzio were to die. On the first of May too! Santa\r\nReparata is too good to us to allow such ill-luck;\u2014and she has more\r\nfavour, I trust, in the seventh heaven than all the Ghibelline saints in\r\nyour calendar. No, good Cincolo, Marzio is not dead, nor the Holy\r\nFather, nor Messer Carlo of Naples; but I would bet my gold cross\r\nagainst the wealth of your banished men, that Pisa is taken\u2014or\r\nCorradino\u2014or\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I here! No, Gegia, old as I am, and much as you need my help (and\r\nthat last is why I am here at all), Pisa would not be taken while this\r\nold body could stand in the breach; or Corradino die, till this lazy\r\nblood were colder on the ground than it is in my body. Ask no more\r\nquestions, and do not rouse me: there is no news, no good or ill-luck,\r\nthat I know. But when I saw the Neri, the Pulci, the Buondelmonti, and\r\nthe rest of them, ride like kings through the streets, whose very hands\r\nare hardly dry from the blood of my kindred; when I saw their daughter\r\ncrowned with flowers, and thought how the daughter of Arrigo dei Elisei\r\nwas mourning for her murdered father, with ashes on her head, by the\r\nhearth of a stranger,\u2014my spirit must be more dead than it is if such a\r\nsight did not make me wish to drive among them; and methought I could\r\nscatter their pomp with my awl for a sword. But I remembered thee, and\r\nam here unstained with blood.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat thou wilt never be!\u201d cried Monna Gegia, the colour rising in her\r\nwrinkled cheeks. \u201cSince the battle of Monte Aperto thou hast never been\r\nwell washed of that shed by thee and thy confederates; and how could ye?\r\nfor the Arno has never since run clear of the blood then spilt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd if the sea were red with that blood, still, while there is any of\r\nthe Guelphs\u2019 to spill, I am ready to spill it, were it not for thee.\r\nThou dost well to mention Monte Aperto, and thou wouldst do better to\r\nremember over whom its grass now grows.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPeace, Cincolo; a mother\u2019s heart has more memory in it than thou\r\nthinkest; and I well recollect who spurned me as I knelt, and dragged my\r\nonly child, but sixteen years of age, to die in the cause of that\r\nmisbeliever Manfred. Let us indeed speak no more. Woe was the day when I\r\nmarried thee! but those were happy times when there was neither Guelph\r\nnor Ghibelline;\u2014they will never return.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever,\u2014until, as thou sayest, the Arno run clear of the blood shed on\r\nits banks;\u2014never while I can pierce the heart of a Guelph;\u2014never till\r\nboth parties are cold under one bier.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd thou and I, Cincolo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre two old fools, and shall be more at peace under ground than above\r\nit. Rank Guelph as thou art, I married thee before I was a Ghibelline;\r\nso now I must eat from the same platter with the enemy of Manfred, and\r\nmake shoes for Guelphs, instead of following the fortunes of Dorradino,\r\nand sending them, my battle-axe in my hand, to buy their shoes in\r\nBologna.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHush! hush! good man, talk not so loud of thy party; hearest thou not\r\nthat some one knocks?\u201d\r\n\r\nCincolo went to open the door with the air of a man who thinks himself\r\nill-used at being interrupted in his discourse, and is disposed to be\r\nangry with the intruder, however innocent he might be of any intention\r\nof breaking in upon his eloquent complaint. The appearance of his\r\nvisitor calmed his indignant feelings. He was a youth whose countenance\r\nand person showed that he could not be more than sixteen; but there was\r\na self-possession in his demeanour, and a dignity in his physiognomy,\r\nthat belonged to a more advanced age. His figure was slight, and his\r\ncountenance, though beautiful, was pale as monumental marble; the thick\r\nand curling locks of his chestnut hair clustered over his brow and round\r\nhis fair throat; his cap was drawn far down on his forehead. Cincolo was\r\nabout to usher him with deference into his humble room, but the youth\r\nstayed him with his hand, and uttered the words \u201c_Swabia, Cavalieri!_\u201d\r\nthe words by which the Ghibellines were accustomed to recognise each\r\nother. He continued in a low and hurried tone: \u201cYour wife is within?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEnough. Although I am a stranger to you, I come from an old friend.\r\nHarbour me until nightfall; we will then go out, and I will explain to\r\nyou the motives of my intrusion. Call me Ricciardo de\u2019 Rossini of Milan,\r\ntravelling to Rome. I leave Florence this evening.\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving said these words, without giving Cincolo time to reply, he\r\nmotioned that they should enter the room. Monna Gegia had fixed her eyes\r\non the door from the moment he had opened it, with a look of impatient\r\ncuriosity; when she saw the youth enter, she could not refrain from\r\nexclaiming, \u201cGesu Maria!\u201d\u2014so different was he from any one she had\r\nexpected to see.\r\n\r\n\u201cA friend from Milan,\u201d said Cincolo.\r\n\r\n\u201cMore likely from Lucca,\u201d replied his wife, gazing on her visitant. \u201cYou\r\nare doubtless one of the banished men, and you are more daring than wise\r\nto enter this town; however, if you be not a spy, you are safe with me.\u201d\r\n\r\nRicciardo smiled and thanked her in a low, sweet voice. \u201cIf you do not\r\nturn me out,\u201d he said, \u201cI shall remain under your roof nearly all the\r\ntime I remain in Florence, and I leave it soon after dusk.\u201d\r\n\r\nGegia again gazed on her guest, nor did Cincolo scrutinize him with less\r\ncuriosity. His black cloth tunic reached below his knees, and was\r\nconfined by a black leather girdle at the waist. He had on trousers of\r\ncoarse scarlet stuff, over which were drawn short boots; a cloak of\r\ncommon fox\u2019s fur, unlined, hung from his shoulder. But, although his\r\ndress was thus simple, it was such as was then worn by the young\r\nFlorentine nobility. At that time the Italians were simple in their\r\nprivate habits: the French army led by Charles d\u2019Anjou into Italy, first\r\nintroduced luxury into the palaces of the Cisalpines. Manfred was a\r\nmagnificent prince, but it was his saintly rival who was the author of\r\nthat trifling foppery of dress and ornaments which degrades a nation,\r\nand is a sure precursor of their downfall. But of Ricciardo\u2014his\r\ncountenance had all the regularity of a Grecian head; and his blue eyes,\r\nshaded by very long, dark eyelashes, were soft, yet full of expression.\r\nWhen he looked up, the heavy lids, as it were, unveiled the gentle light\r\nbeneath, and then again closed over them, as shading what was too\r\nbrilliant to behold. His lips expressed the deepest sensibility, and\r\nsomething perhaps of timidity, had not the placid confidence of his\r\ndemeanour forbidden such an idea.\r\n\r\nHis host and hostess were at first silent; but he asked some natural\r\nquestions about the buildings of their city, and by degrees led them\r\ninto discourse. When mid-day struck, Cincolo looked towards his pot of\r\n_minestra_, and Ricciardo followed his look, asked if that was not the\r\ndinner. \u201cYou must entertain me,\u201d he said, \u201cfor I have not eaten to-day.\u201d\r\nA table was drawn near the window, and the _minestra_, poured out into\r\none plate, was placed in the middle of it, a spoon was given to each,\r\nand a jug of wine filled from a barrel. Ricciardo looked at the two old\r\npeople, and seemed somewhat to smile at the idea of eating from the same\r\nplate with them; he ate, however, though sparingly, and drank of the\r\nwine, though with still greater moderation. Cincolo, however, under\r\npretence of serving his guest, filled his jug a second time, and was\r\nabout to rise for the third measure, when Ricciardo, placing his small\r\nwhite hand on his arm, said, \u201cAre you a German, my friend, that you\r\ncease not after so many draughts? I have heard that you Florentines were\r\na sober people.\u201d\r\n\r\nCincolo was not much pleased with this reproof, but he felt that it was\r\ntimely; so, conceding the point, he sat down again, and, somewhat heated\r\nwith what he had already drank, he asked his guest the news from\r\nGermany, and what hopes for the good cause? Gegia bridled at these\r\nwords, and Ricciardo replied, \u201cMany reports are abroad, and high hopes\r\nentertained, especially in the north of Italy, for the success of our\r\nexpedition. Corradino is arrived at Genoa, and it is hoped that,\r\nalthough the ranks of his army were much thinned by the desertion of his\r\nGerman troops, they will be quickly filled by Italians, braver and truer\r\nthan those foreigners, who, strangers to our soil, could not fight for\r\nhis cause with our ardour?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how does he bear himself?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs beseems one of the house of Swabia, and the nephew of Manfred. He is\r\ninexperienced and young. He is not more than sixteen. His mother would\r\nhardly consent to this expedition, but wept at the fear of all he might\r\nendure; for he has been nursed in every luxury, and habituated to the\r\ntender care of a woman, who, although she be a princess, has waited on\r\nhim with anxious solicitude. But Corradino is of good heart; docile, but\r\ncourageous; obedient to his wiser friends, gentle to his inferiors, but\r\nnoble of soul, the spirit of Manfred seems to animate his unfolding\r\nmind; and surely, if that glorious prince now enjoys the reward of his\r\nsurpassing virtues, he looks down with joy and approbation on him who\r\nis, I trust, destined to fill his throne.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm with which Ricciardo spoke suffused his pale countenance\r\nwith a slight blush, while his eyes swam in the lustre of the dew that\r\nfilled them. Gegia was little pleased with this harangue, but curiosity\r\nkept her silent, while her husband proceeded to question his guest. \u201cYou\r\nseem to be well acquainted with Corradino?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw him at Milan, and was closely connected with his most intimate\r\nfriend there. As I have said, he has arrived at Genoa, and perhaps has\r\neven now landed at Pisa; he will find many friends in that town. Every\r\nman there will be his friend; but during his journey southward he will\r\nhave to contend with our Florentine army, commanded by the Marshals of\r\nthe usurper Charles, and assisted by his troops. Charles himself has\r\nleft us, and is gone to Naples to prepare for this war. But he is\r\ndetested there, as a tyrant and a robber, and Corradino will be received\r\nin the Regno as a saviour; so that if he once surmount the obstacles\r\nwhich oppose his entrance, I do not doubt his success, and trust that he\r\nwill be crowned within a month at Rome, and the week after sit on the\r\nthrone of his ancestors in Naples.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who will crown him?\u201d cried Gegia, unable to contain herself. \u201cItaly\r\ncontains no heretic base enough to do such a deed, unless it be a Jew;\r\nor he send to Constantinople for a Greek, or to Egypt for a Mohammedan.\r\nCursed may the race of the Frederics ever be! Thrice cursed one who has\r\naffinity to the miscreant Manfred! And little do you please me, young\r\nman, by holding such discourse in my house.\u201d\r\n\r\nCincolo looked at Ricciardo, as if he feared that so violent a partisan\r\nfor the house of Swabia would be irritated at his wife\u2019s attack; but he\r\nwas looking on the aged woman with a regard of the most serene\r\nbenignity; no contempt even was mingled with the gentle smile that\r\nplayed round his lips. \u201cI will restrain myself,\u201d he said, and, turning\r\nto Cincolo, he conversed on more general subjects, describing the\r\nvarious cities of Italy that he had visited; discussing their modes of\r\ngovernment, and relating anecdotes concerning their inhabitants, with an\r\nair of experience that, contrasted with his youthful appearance, greatly\r\nimpressed Cincolo, who looked on him at once with admiration and\r\nrespect. Evening came on. The sound of bells died away after the _Ave\r\nMaria_ had ceased to ring, but the distant sound of music was wafted to\r\nthem by the night air. Ricciardo was about to address Cincolo, when a\r\nknocking at the gate interrupted him. It was Buzeccha, the Saracen, a\r\nfamous chess-player, who was used to parade about under the colonnades\r\nof the Duomo, and challenge the young nobles to play; and sometimes much\r\nstress was laid on these games, and the gain and loss became the talk of\r\nFlorence. Buzeccha was a tall and ungainly man, with all that\r\ngood-natured consequence of manner which the fame he had acquired by his\r\nproficiency in so trifling a science, and the familiarity with which he\r\nwas permitted to treat those superior to him in rank, who were pleased\r\nto measure their forces with him, might well bestow. He was beginning\r\nwith \u201cEh, Messere!\u201d when perceiving Ricciardo, he cried, \u201cWho have we\r\nhere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA friend to good men,\u201d replied Ricciardo, smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, by Mahomet, thou art my friend, my stripling.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThou shouldst be a Saracen, by thy speech?\u201d said Ricciardo.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd through the help of the Prophet, so am I. One who in Manfred\u2019s\r\ntime\u2014but no more of that. We won\u2019t talk of Manfred, eh, Monna Gegia? I\r\nam Buzeccha, the chess-player, at your service, Messer lo Forestiere.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe introduction thus made, they began to talk of the procession of the\r\nday. After a while, Buzeccha introduced his favourite subject of\r\nchess-playing; he recounted some wonderfully good strokes he had\r\nachieved, and related to Ricciardo how before the _Palagio del Popolo_,\r\nin the presence of Count Guido Novelle de\u2019 Giudi, then _Vicare_ of the\r\ncity, he had played an hour at three chess-boards with three of the best\r\nchess-players in Florence, playing two by memory and one by sight; and\r\nout of three games which made the board, he had won two. This account\r\nwas wound up by a proposal to play with his host. \u201cThou art a\r\nhard-headed fellow, Cincolo, and make better play than the nobles. I\r\nwould swear that thou thinkest of chess only as thou cobblest thy shoes;\r\nevery hole of your awl is a square of the board, every stitch a move,\r\nand a finished pair paid for checkmate to your adversary; eh, Cincolo?\r\nBring out the field of battle, man.\u201d\r\n\r\nRicciardo interposed: \u201cI leave Florence in two hours, and before I go,\r\nMesser Cincolo promised to conduct me to the _Piazza del Duomo_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPlenty of time, good youth,\u201d cried Buzeccha, arranging his men; \u201cI only\r\nclaim one game, and my games never last more than a quarter of an hour;\r\nand then we will both escort you, and you shall dance a set into the\r\nbargain with a black-eyed houri, all Nazarine as thou art. So stand out\r\nof my light, good youth, and shut the window, if you have heeding, that\r\nthe torch flare not so.\u201d\r\n\r\nRicciardo seemed amused by the authoritative tone of the chess-player;\r\nhe shut the window and trimmed the torch which, stuck against the wall,\r\nwas the only light they had, and stood by the table, overlooking the\r\ngame. Monna Gegia had replaced the pot for supper, and sat somewhat\r\nuneasily, as if she were displeased that her guest did not talk with\r\nher. Cincolo and Buzeccha were deeply intent on their game, when a knock\r\nwas heard at the door. Cincolo was about to rise and open it, but\r\nRicciardo saying, \u201cDo not disturb yourself,\u201d opened it himself, with the\r\nmanner of one who does humble offices as if ennobling them, so that no\r\none action can be more humble to them than another.\r\n\r\nThe visitant was welcomed by Gegia alone, with \u201cAh! Messer Beppe, this\r\nis kind, on May Day night.\u201d\r\n\r\nRicciardo glanced slightly on him, and then resumed his stand by the\r\nplayers. There was little in Messer Beppe to attract a favourable\r\nregard. He was short, thin, and dry; his face long-drawn and liny; his\r\neyes deep-set and scowling, his lips straight, his nose hooked, and his\r\nhead covered by a close skull-cap, his hair cut close all round. He sat\r\ndown near Gegia, and began to discourse in a whining, servile, voice,\r\ncomplimenting her on her good looks, launching forth into praise of the\r\nmagnificence of certain Guelph Florentines, and concluded by declaring\r\nthat he was hungry and tired.\r\n\r\n\u201cHungry, Beppe?\u201d said Gegia, \u201cthat should have been your first word,\r\nfriend. Cincolo, wilt thou give thy guest to eat? Cincolo, art thou\r\ndeaf? Art thou blind? Dost thou not hear? Wilt thou not see?\u2014Here is\r\nMesser Giuseppe de\u2019 Bosticchi.\u201d\r\n\r\nCincolo slowly, his eyes still fixed on the board, was about to rise.\r\nBut the name of the visitant seemed to have the effect of magic on\r\nRicciardo.\r\n\r\n\u201cBosticchi!\u201d he cried\u2014\u201cGiuseppe Bosticchi! I did not expect to find that\r\nman beneath thy roof, Cincolo, all Guelph as thy wife is; for she also\r\nhas eaten of the bread of Elisei. Farewell! thou wilt find me in the\r\nstreet below; follow me quickly.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was about to go, but Bosticchi placed himself before the door, saying\r\nin a tone whose whine expressed mingled rage and servility, \u201cIn what\r\nhave I offended this young gentleman? Will he not tell me my offence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDare not to stop my way,\u201d cried Ricciardo, passing his hand before his\r\neyes, \u201cnor force me again to look on thee. Begone!\u201d\r\n\r\nCincolo stopped him. \u201cThou art too hasty, and far too passionate, my\r\nnoble guest,\u201d said he; \u201chowever this man may have offended thee, thou\r\nart too violent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cViolent!\u201d cried Ricciardo, almost suffocated by passionate emotion.\r\n\u201cAy, draw thy knife, and show the blood of Arrigo dei Elisei, with which\r\nit is still stained.\u201d\r\n\r\nA dead silence followed. Bosticchi slunk out of the room; Ricciardo hid\r\nhis face in his hands and wept. But soon he calmed his passion, and\r\nsaid: \u201cThis is indeed childish. Pardon me; that man is gone; excuse and\r\nforget my violence. Resume thy game, Cincolo, but conclude it quickly,\r\nfor time gains on us. Hark! an hour of night sounds from the Campanile.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe game is already concluded,\u201d said Buzeccha sorrowfully; \u201cthy cloak\r\noverthrew the best checkmate this head ever planned\u2014so God forgive\r\nthee!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCheckmate!\u201d cried the indignant Cincolo\u2014\u201cCheckmate! and my queen mowing\r\nyou down, rank and file!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us begone!\u201d exclaimed Ricciardo. \u201cMesser Buzeccha, you will play\r\nout your game with Monna Gegia. Cincolo will return ere long.\u201d So taking\r\nhis host by the arm, he drew him out of the room, and descended the\r\nnarrow high stairs with the air of one to whom those stairs were not\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nWhen in the street he slackened his pace, and, first looking round to\r\nassure himself that none overheard their conversation, he addressed\r\nCincolo: \u201cPardon me, my dear friend; I am hasty, and the sight of that\r\nman made every drop of my blood cry aloud in my veins. But I do not come\r\nhere to indulge in private sorrows or private revenge, and my design\r\nought alone to engross me. It is necessary for me to see speedily and\r\nsecretly Messer Guielmo Lostendardo, the Neapolitan commander. I bear a\r\nmessage to him from the Countess Elizabeth, the mother of Corradino, and\r\nI have some hope that its import may induce him to take at least a\r\nneutral part during the impending conflict. I have chosen you, Cincolo,\r\nto aid me in this, for not only you are of that little note in your town\r\nthat you may act for me without attracting observation, but you are\r\nbrave and true, and I may confide to your known worth. Lostendardo\r\nresides at the _Palagio del Governo_. When I enter its doors I am in the\r\nhands of my enemies, and its dungeons may alone know the secret of my\r\ndestiny. I hope better things. But if after two hours I do not appear or\r\nlet you hear of my welfare, carry this packet to Corradino at Pisa. You\r\nwill then learn who I am; and if you feel any indignation at my fate,\r\nlet that feeling attach you still more strongly to the cause for which I\r\nlive and die.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Ricciardo spoke, he still walked on, and Cincolo observed that,\r\nwithout his guidance, he directed his steps towards the _Palagio del\r\nGoverno_.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not understand this,\u201d said the old man. \u201cBy what argument, unless\r\nyou bring one from the other world, do you hope to induce Messer Guielmo\r\nto aid Corradino? He is so bitter an enemy of Manfred, that although\r\nthat prince is dead, yet when he mentions his name he grasps the air as\r\nit were a dagger. I have heard him with horrible imprecations curse the\r\nwhole house of Swabia.\u201d\r\n\r\nA tremor shook the frame of Ricciardo, but he replied, \u201cLostendardo was\r\nonce the firmest support of that house, and the friend of Manfred.\r\nStrange circumstances gave birth in his mind to this unnatural hatred,\r\nand he became a traitor. But, perhaps, now that Manfred is in Paradise,\r\nthe youth, the virtues, and the inexperience of Corradino may inspire\r\nhim with more generous feelings, and reawaken his ancient faith. At\r\nleast I must make this last trial. This cause is too holy, too sacred,\r\nto admit of common forms of reasoning or action. The nephew of Manfred\r\nmust sit upon the throne of his ancestors; and to achieve that I will\r\nendure what I am about to endure.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey entered the palace; Messer Guielmo was carousing in the great hall.\r\n\r\n\u201cBear this ring to him, good Cincolo, and say that I wait. Be speedy,\r\nthat my courage, my life, do not desert me at the moment of trial.\u201d\r\n\r\nCincolo, casting one more inquisitive glance on his extraordinary\r\ncompanion, obeyed his orders, while the youth leant against one of the\r\npillars of the court and passionately cast up his eyes to the clear\r\nfirmament.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, ye stars!\u201d he cried in a smothered voice, \u201cye are eternal; let my\r\npurpose, my will, be as constant as ye!\u201d\r\n\r\nThen, more calm, he folded his arms in his cloak, and with strong inward\r\nstruggle endeavoured to repress his emotion. Several servants approached\r\nhim, and bade him follow them. Again he looked at the sky and said,\r\n\u201cManfred,\u201d and then he walked on with slow but firm steps. They led him\r\nthrough several halls and corridors to a large apartment hung with\r\ntapestry, and well lighted by numerous torches; the marble of the floor\r\nreflected their glare, and the arched roof echoed the footsteps of one\r\nwho paced the apartment as Ricciardo entered. It was Lostendardo. He\r\nmade a sign that the servants should retire; the heavy door closed\r\nbehind them, and Ricciardo stood alone with Messer Guielmo; his\r\ncountenance pale but composed, his eyes cast down as in expectation, not\r\nin fear; and but for the convulsive motion of his lips, you would have\r\nguessed that every faculty was almost suspended by intense agitation.\r\n\r\nLostendardo approached. He was a man in the prime of life, tall and\r\nathletic; he seemed capable with a single exertion to crush the frail\r\nbeing of Ricciardo. Every feature of his countenance spoke of the\r\nstruggle of passions, and the terrible egotism of one who would\r\nsacrifice even himself to the establishment of his will: his black\r\neyebrows were scattered, his grey eyes deep-set and scowling, his look\r\nat once stern and haggard. A smile seemed never to have disturbed the\r\nsettled scorn which his lips expressed; his high forehead, already\r\nbecoming bald, was marked by a thousand contradictory lines. His voice\r\nwas studiously restrained as he said: \u201cWherefore do you bring that\r\nring?\u201d\r\n\r\nRicciardo looked up and met his eye, which glanced fire as he exclaimed,\r\n\u201cDespina!\u201d\u2014He seized her hand with a giant\u2019s grasp: \u201cI have prayed for\r\nthis night and day, and thou art now here! Nay, do not struggle; you are\r\nmine; for by my salvation I swear that thou shalt never again escape\r\nme.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespina replied calmly: \u201cThou mayest well believe that in thus placing\r\nmyself in thy power I do not dread any injury thou canst inflict upon\r\nme, or I were not here. I do not fear thee, for I do not fear death.\r\nLoosen then thy hold, and listen to me. I come in the name of those\r\nvirtues that were once thine; I come in the name of all noble sentiment,\r\ngenerosity, and ancient faith, and I trust that in listening to me your\r\nheroic nature will second my voice, and that Lostendardo will no longer\r\nrank with those whom the good and great never name but to condemn.\u201d\r\n\r\nLostendardo appeared to attend little to what she said. He gazed on her\r\nwith triumph and malignant pride; and if he still held her his motive\r\nappeared rather the delight he felt in displaying his power over her,\r\nthan any fear that she would escape. You might read in her pale cheek\r\nand glazed eye, that if she feared, it was herself alone that she\r\nmistrusted; that her design lifted her above mortal dread, and that she\r\nwas as impassive as the marble she resembled to any event that did not\r\neither advance or injure the object for which she came. They were both\r\nsilent, until Lostendardo leading her to a seat, and then standing\r\nopposite to her, his arms folded, every feature dilated by triumph, and\r\nhis voice sharpened by agitation, he said: \u201cWell, speak! What wouldst\r\nthou with me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI come to request, that if you cannot be induced to assist Prince\r\nCorradino in the present struggle, you will, at least, stand neutral,\r\nand not oppose his advance to the kingdom of his ancestors.\u201d\r\n\r\nLostendardo laughed. The vaulted roof repeated the sound, but the harsh\r\necho, though it resembled the sharp cry of an animal of prey whose paw\r\nis on the heart of its enemy, was not so discordant and dishuman as the\r\nlaugh itself. \u201cHow,\u201d he asked, \u201cdost thou pretend to induce me to\r\ncomply? This dagger\u201d\u2014and he touched the hilt of one that was half\r\nconcealed in his vesture\u2014\u201cis yet stained by the blood of Manfred; ere\r\nlong it will be sheathed in the heart of that foolish boy.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespina conquered the feeling of horror these words inspired, and\r\nreplied: \u201cWill you give a few minutes\u2019 patient hearing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will give you a few minutes\u2019 hearing, and if I be not so patient as\r\nin the Palagio Reale, fair Despina must excuse me. Forbearance is not a\r\nvirtue to which I aspire.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it was in the Palagio Reale at Naples, the palace of Manfred, that\r\nyou first saw me. You were then the bosom friend of Manfred, selected by\r\nhim as his confidant and counsellor. Why did you become a traitor? Start\r\nnot at that word: if you could hear the united voice of Italy, and even\r\nof those who call themselves your friends, they would echo that name.\r\nWhy did you thus degrade and belie yourself? You call me the cause, yet\r\nI am most innocent. You saw me at the Court of your master, an attendant\r\non Queen Sibilla, and one who, unknown to herself, had already parted\r\nwith her heart, her soul, her will, her entire being, an involuntary\r\nsacrifice at the shrine of all that is noble and divine in human nature.\r\nMy spirit worshipped Manfred as a saint, and my pulses ceased to beat\r\nwhen his eye fell upon me. I felt this, but I knew it not. You awoke me\r\nfrom my dream. You said that you loved me, and you reflected in too\r\nfaithful a mirror my own emotions: I saw myself and shuddered. But the\r\nprofound and eternal nature of my passion saved me. I loved Manfred. I\r\nloved the sun because it enlightened him; I loved the air that fed him;\r\nI deified myself, for that my heart was the temple in which he resided.\r\nI devoted myself to Sibilla, for she was his wife, and never in thought\r\nor dream degraded the purity of my affection towards him. For this you\r\nhated him. He was ignorant of my passion: my heart contained it as a\r\ntreasure, which you having discovered came to rifle. You could more\r\neasily deprive me of life than my devotion for your king, and therefore\r\nyou were a traitor. Manfred died, and you thought that I had then\r\nforgotten him. But love would indeed be a mockery if death were not the\r\nmost barefaced cheat. How can he die who is immortalized in my\r\nthoughts\u2014my thoughts, that comprehend the universe, and contain eternity\r\nin their graspings? What though his earthly vesture is thrown as a\r\ndespised weed beside the verde, he lives in my soul as lovely, as noble,\r\nas entire, as when his voice awoke the mute air; nay, his life is more\r\nentire, more true. For before, that small shrine that encased his spirit\r\nwas all that existed of him; but now, he is a part of all things; his\r\nspirit surrounds me, interpenetrates; and divided from him during his\r\nlife, his death has united me to him for ever.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe countenance of Lostendardo darkened fearfully. When she paused, he\r\nlooked black as the sea before the heavily charged thunder-clouds that\r\ncanopy it dissolve themselves into rain. The tempest of passion that\r\narose in his heart seemed too mighty to admit of swift manifestation; it\r\ncame slowly up from the profoundest depths of his soul, and emotion was\r\npiled upon emotion before the lightning of his anger sped to its\r\ndestination. \u201cYour arguments, eloquent Despina,\u201d he said, \u201care indeed\r\nunanswerable. They work well for your purpose. Corradino is, I hear, at\r\nPisa: you have sharpened my dagger; and before the air of another night\r\nrust it, I may, by deeds, have repaid your insulting words.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow far do you mistake me! And is praise and love of all heroic\r\nexcellence insult to you? Lostendardo, when you first knew me, I was an\r\ninexperienced girl; I loved, but knew not what love was, and\r\ncircumscribing my passion in narrow bounds, I adored the being of\r\nManfred as I might love an effigy of stone, which, when broken, has no\r\nlonger an existence. I am now much altered. I might before have treated\r\nyou with disdain or anger, but now these base feelings have expired in\r\nmy heart. I am animated but by one feeling\u2014an aspiration to another\r\nlife, another state of being. All the good depart from this strange\r\nearth; and I doubt not that when I am sufficiently elevated above human\r\nweaknesses, it will also be my turn to leave this scene of woe. I\r\nprepare myself for that moment alone; and in endeavouring to fit myself\r\nfor a union with all the brave, generous, and wise, that once adorned\r\nhumanity, and have now passed from it, I consecrate myself to the\r\nservice of this most righteous cause. You wrong me, therefore, if you\r\nthink there is aught of disdain in what I say, or that any degrading\r\nfeelings are mingled with my devotion of spirit when I come and\r\nvoluntarily place myself in your power. You can imprison me for ever in\r\nthe dungeons of this palace, as a returned Ghibelline and spy, and have\r\nme executed as a criminal. But before you do this, pause for your own\r\nsake; reflect on the choice of glory or ignominy that you are now about\r\nto make. Let your old sentiments of love for the house of Swabia have\r\nsome sway in your heart; reflect, that as you are the despised enemy, so\r\nyou may become the chosen friend of its last descendant, and receive\r\nfrom every heart the praise of having restored Corradino to the honours\r\nand power to which he was born. Compare this prince to the hypocritical,\r\nthe bloody and mean-spirited Charles. When Manfred died I went to\r\nGermany, and have resided at the court of the Countess Elizabeth; I have\r\ntherefore been an hourly witness of the great and good qualities of\r\nCorradino. The bravery of his spirit makes him rise above the weakness\r\nof youth and inexperience; he possesses all the nobility of spirit that\r\nbelongs to the family of Swabia, and, in addition, a purity and\r\ngentleness that attracts the respect and love of the old and wary\r\ncourtiers of Frederic and Conrad. You are brave, and would be generous,\r\ndid not the fury of your passions, like a consuming fire, destroy in\r\ntheir violence every generous sentiment: how then can you become the\r\ntool of Charles? His scowling eyes and sneering lips betoken the\r\nselfishness of his mind. Avarice, cruelty, meanness, and artifice are\r\nthe qualities that characterize him, and render him unworthy of the\r\nmajesty he usurps. Let him return to Provence, and reign with paltry\r\ndespotism over the luxurious and servile French; the free-born Italians\r\nrequire another lord. They are not fit to bow to one whose palace is the\r\nchange-house of money-lenders, whose generals are usurers, whose\r\ncourtiers are milliners or monks, and who basely vows allegiance to the\r\nenemy of freedom and virtue, Clement, the murderer of Manfred. Their\r\nking, like them, should be clothed in the armour of valour and\r\nsimplicity; his ornaments, his shield and spear; his treasury, the\r\npossessions of his subjects; his army, their unshaken lover. Charles\r\nwill treat you as a tool; Corradino as a friend. Charles will make you\r\nthe detested tyrant of a groaning province; Corradino, the governor of a\r\nprosperous and happy people. I cannot tell by your manner if what I have\r\nsaid has in any degree altered your determination. I cannot forget the\r\nscenes that passed between us at Naples. I might then have been\r\ndisdainful; I am not so now. Your execrations of Manfred excited every\r\nangry feeling in my mind; but, as I have said, all but the feeling of\r\nlove expired in my heart when Manfred died, and methinks that where love\r\nis, excellence must be its companion. You said you loved me; and though,\r\nin other times, that love was twin-brother to hate,\u2014though then, poor\r\nprisoner in your heart, jealousy, rage, contempt, and cruelty, were its\r\nhandmaids,\u2014yet if it were love, methinks that its divinity must have\r\npurified your heart from baser feelings; and now that I, the bride of\r\nDeath, am removed from your sphere, gentler feelings may awaken in your\r\nbosom, and you may incline mildly to my voice. If indeed you loved me,\r\nwill you not now be my friend? Shall we not hand in hand pursue the same\r\ncareer? Return to your ancient faith; and now that death and religion\r\nhave placed the seal upon the past, let Manfred\u2019s spirit, looking down,\r\nbehold his repentant friend the firm ally of his successor, the best and\r\nlast scion of the house of Swabia.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe ceased; for the glare of savage triumph which, as a rising fire at\r\nnight-time, enlightened with growing and fearful radiance the face of\r\nLostendardo, made her pause in her appeal. He did not reply; but when\r\nshe was silent he quitted the attitude in which he had stood immovably\r\nopposite to her, and pacing the hall with measured steps, his head\r\ndeclined, he seemed to ruminate on some project. Could it be that he\r\nweighed her reasonings? If he hesitated, the side of generosity and old\r\nfidelity would certainly prevail. Yet she dared not hope; her heart beat\r\nfast; she would have knelt, but she feared to move, lest any motion\r\nshould disturb his thoughts, and curb the flow of good feeling which she\r\nfondly hoped had arisen within him: she looked up and prayed silently as\r\nshe sat. Notwithstanding the glare of the torches, the beams of one\r\nsmall star struggled through the dark window pane; her eye resting on\r\nit, her thoughts were at once elevated to the eternity and space which\r\nthat star symbolized; it seemed to her the spirit of Manfred, and she\r\ninwardly worshipped it, as she prayed that it would shed its benign\r\ninfluence on the soul of Lostendardo.\r\n\r\nSome minutes elapsed in this fearful silence, and then he approached\r\nher. \u201cDespina, allow me to reflect on your words; to-morrow I will\r\nanswer you. You will remain in this palace until the morning, and then\r\nyou shall see and judge of my repentance and returning faith.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe spoke with studious gentleness. Despina could not see his face, for\r\nthe lights shone behind him. When she looked up to reply, the little\r\nstar twinkled just above his head, and seemed with its gentle lustre to\r\nreassure her. Our minds, when highly wrought, are strangely given to\r\nsuperstition, and Despina lived in a superstitious age. She thought that\r\nthe star bade her comply, and assured her of protection from\r\nHeaven;\u2014from where else could she expect it? She said, therefore, \u201cI\r\nconsent. Only let me request that you acquaint the man who gave you my\r\nring that I am safe, or he will fear for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do as you desire.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I will confide myself to your care. I cannot, dare not, fear you.\r\nIf you would betray me, still I trust in the heavenly saints that guard\r\nhumanity.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer countenance was so calm,\u2014it beamed with so angelic a self-devotion\r\nand a belief in good, that Lostendardo dared not look on her. For one\r\nmoment\u2014as she, having ceased to speak, gazed upon the star\u2014he felt\r\nimpelled to throw himself at her feet, to confess the diabolical scheme\r\nhe had forged, and to commit himself body and soul to her guidance, to\r\nobey, to serve, to worship her. The impulse was momentary; the feeling\r\nof revenge returned on him. From the moment she had rejected him, the\r\nfire of rage had burned in his heart, consuming all healthy feeling, all\r\nhuman sympathies, and gentleness of soul. He had sworn never to sleep on\r\na bed, or to drink aught but water, until his first cup of wine was\r\nmingled with the blood of Manfred. He had fulfilled this vow. A strange\r\nalteration had worked within him from the moment he had drained that\r\nunholy cup. The spirit, not of a man, but of a devil, seemed to live\r\nwithin him, urging him to crime, from which his long protracted hope of\r\nmore complete revenge had alone deterred him. But Despina was now in his\r\npower, and it seemed to him as if fate had preserved him so long only\r\nthat he might now wreak his full rage upon her. When she spoke of love,\r\nhe thought how from that he might extract pain. He formed his plan; and\r\nthis slight human weakness now conquered, he bent his thoughts to its\r\ncompletion. Yet he feared to stay longer with her; so he quitted her,\r\nsaying that he would send attendants who would show her an apartment\r\nwhere she might repose. He left her, and several hours passed; but no\r\none came. The torches burnt low, and the stars of heaven could now with\r\ntwinkling beams conquer their feebler light. One by one these torches\r\nwent out, and the shadows of the high windows of the hall, before\r\ninvisible, were thrown upon its marble pavement. Despina looked upon the\r\nshade, at first unconsciously, until she found herself counting one,\r\ntwo, three, the shapes of the iron bars that lay so placidly on the\r\nstone. \u201cThose grates are thick,\u201d she said; \u201cthis room would be a large\r\nbut secure dungeon.\u201d As by inspiration, she now felt that she was a\r\nprisoner. No change, no word, had intervened since she had walked\r\nfearlessly in the room, believing herself free. But now no doubt of her\r\nsituation occurred to her mind; heavy chains seemed to fall around her;\r\nthe air to feel thick and heavy as that of a prison; and the star-beams\r\nthat had before cheered her, became the dreary messengers of fearful\r\ndanger to herself, and of the utter defeat of all the hopes she had\r\ndared nourish of success to her beloved cause.\r\n\r\nCincolo waited, first with impatience, and then with anxiety, for the\r\nreturn of the youthful stranger. He paced up and down before the gates\r\nof the palace; hour after hour passed on; the stars arose and descended,\r\nand ever and anon meteors shot along the sky. They were not more\r\nfrequent than they always are during a clear summer night in Italy; but\r\nthey appeared strangely numerous to Cincolo, and portentous of change\r\nand calamity. Midnight struck, and at that moment a procession of monks\r\npassed, bearing a corpse and chanting a solemn _De Profundis_. Cincolo\r\nfelt a cold tremor shake his limbs when he reflected how ill an augury\r\nthis was for the strange adventurer he had guided to that palace. The\r\nsombre cowls of the priests, their hollow voices, and the dark burden\r\nthey carried, augmented his agitation even to terror. Without confessing\r\nthe cowardice to himself, he was possessed with fear lest he should be\r\nincluded in the evil destiny that evidently awaited his companion.\r\nCincolo was a brave man; he had often been foremost in a perilous\r\nassault; but the most courageous among us sometimes feel our hearts fail\r\nwithin us at the dread of unknown and fated danger. He was struck with\r\npanic;\u2014he looked after the disappearing lights of the procession, and\r\nlistened to their fading voices; his knees shook, a cold perspiration\r\nstood on his brow; until, unable to resist the impulse, he began slowly\r\nto withdraw himself from the Palace of Government, and to quit the\r\ncircle of danger which seemed to hedge him in if he remained on that\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly quitted his post by the gate of the palace, when he saw\r\nlights issue from it, attendant on a company of men, some of whom were\r\narmed, as appeared from the reflection their lances\u2019 heads cast; and\r\nsome of them carried a litter, hung with black and closely drawn.\r\nCincolo was rooted to the spot. He could not render himself any reason\r\nfor his belief, but he felt convinced that the stranger youth was there,\r\nabout to be carried out to death. Impelled by curiosity and anxiety, he\r\nfollowed the party as they went towards the Porta Romana: they were\r\nchallenged by the sentinels at the gate; they gave the word and passed.\r\nCincolo dared not follow, but he was agitated by fear and compassion. He\r\nremembered the packet confided to his care; he dared not draw it from\r\nhis bosom, lest any Guelph should be near to overlook and discover that\r\nit was addressed to Corradino; he could not read, but he wished to look\r\nat the arms of the seal, to see whether they bore the imperial ensigns.\r\nHe returned back to the _Palagio del Governo_: all there was dark and\r\nsilent; he walked up and down before the gates, looking up at the\r\nwindows, but no sign of life appeared. He could not tell why he was thus\r\nagitated, but he felt as if all his future peace depended on the fate of\r\nthis stranger youth. He thought of Gegia, her helplessness and age; but\r\nhe could not resist the impulse that impelled him, and he resolved that\r\nvery night to commence his journey to Pisa, to deliver the packet, to\r\nlearn who the stranger was, and what hopes he might entertain for his\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nHe returned home, that he might inform Gegia of his journey. This was a\r\npainful task, but he could not leave her in doubt. He ascended his\r\nnarrow stairs with trepidation. At the head of them a lamp twinkled\r\nbefore a picture of the Virgin. Evening after evening it burnt there,\r\nguarding through its influence his little household from all earthly or\r\nsupernatural dangers. The sight of it inspired him with courage; he said\r\nan _Ave Maria_ before it; and then looking around him to assure himself\r\nthat no spy stood on the narrow landing-place, he drew the packet from\r\nhis bosom and examined the seal. All Italians in those days were\r\nconversant in heraldry, since from ensigns of the shields of the knights\r\nthey learned, better than from their faces or persons, to what family\r\nand party they belonged. But it required no great knowledge for Cincolo\r\nto decipher these arms; he had known them from his childhood; they were\r\nthose of the Elisei, the family to whom he had been attached as a\r\npartisan during all these civil contests. Arrigo de\u2019 Elisei had been his\r\npatron, and his wife had nursed his only daughter, in those happy days\r\nwhen there was neither Guelph nor Ghibelline. The sight of these arms\r\nreawakened all his anxiety. Could this youth belong to that house? The\r\nseal showed that he really did; and this discovery confirmed his\r\ndetermination of making every exertion to save him, and inspired him\r\nwith sufficient courage to encounter the remonstrances and fears of\r\nMonna Gegia.\r\n\r\nHe unlocked his door; the old dame was asleep in her chair, but awoke as\r\nhe entered. She had slept only to refresh her curiosity, and she asked a\r\nthousand questions in a breath, to which Cincolo did not reply: he stood\r\nwith his arms folded looking at the fire, irresolute how to break the\r\nsubject of his departure. Monna Gegia continued to talk.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter you went, we held a consultation concerning this hot-brained\r\nyouth of this morning: I, Buzeccha, Beppe de\u2019 Bosticchi who returned,\r\nand Monna Lissa from the Mercato Nuovo. We all agreed that he must be\r\none of two persons; and be it one or the other, if he have not quitted\r\nFlorence, the _Stinchi_[3] will be his habitation by sunrise. Eh,\r\nCincolo, man! you do not speak; where did you part with your prince?\u201d\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  The name of the common prison at Florence.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrince, Gegia! Are you mad?\u2014what prince?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay, he is either a prince or a baker; either Corradino himself, or\r\nRicciardo, the son of Messer Tommaso de\u2019 Manelli; he that lived o\u2019th\u2019\r\nArno, and baked for all that Sesto, when Count Guido de Giudi was\r\n_Vicario_. By this token, that Messer Tommaso went to Milan with Ubaldo\r\nde\u2019 Gargalandi, and Ricciardo, who went with his father, must now be\r\nsixteen. He had the fame of kneading with as light a hand as his father,\r\nbut he liked better to follow arms with the Gargalandi. He was a fair,\r\nlikely youth, they said; and so, to say the truth, was our youngster of\r\nthis morning. But Monna Lissa will have it that it must be Corradino\r\nhimself.\u201d\r\n\r\nCincolo listened as if the gossip of two old women could unravel his\r\nriddle. He even began to doubt whether the last conjecture, extravagant\r\nas it was, had not hit the truth. Every circumstance forbade such an\r\nidea; but he thought of the youth and exceeding beauty of the stranger,\r\nand he began to doubt. There was none among the Elisei who answered to\r\nhis appearance. The flower of their youth had fallen at Monte Aperto;\r\nthe eldest of the new generation was but ten; the other males of that\r\nhouse were of a mature age. Gegia continued to talk of the anger that\r\nBeppe de\u2019 Bosticchi evinced at being accused of the murder of Arrigo de\u2019\r\nElisei. \u201cIf he had done that deed,\u201d she cried, \u201cnever more should he\r\nhave stood on my hearth; but he swore his innocence; and truly, poor\r\nman, it would be a sin not to believe him.\u201d Why, if the stranger were\r\nnot an Elisei, should he have shown such horror on viewing the supposed\r\nmurderer of the head of that family? Cincolo turned from the fire; he\r\nexamined whether his knife hung safely in his girdle, and he exchanged\r\nhis sandal-like shoes for stronger boots of common undressed fur. This\r\nlast act attracted the attentions of Gegia.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you about, good man?\u201d she cried. \u201cThis is no hour to change\r\nyour dress, but to come to bed. To-night you will not speak; but\r\nto-morrow I hope to get it all out from you. What are you about?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am about to leave you, my dear Gegia; and Heaven bless and take care\r\nof you! I am going to Pisa.\u201d\r\n\r\nGegia uttered a shriek, and was about to remonstrate with great\r\nvolubility, while the tears rolled down her aged cheeks. Tears also\r\nfilled the eyes of Cincolo, as he said, \u201cI do not go for the cause you\r\nsuspect. I do not go into the army of Corradino, though my heart will be\r\nwith it. I go but to carry a letter, and will return without delay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will never return,\u201d cried the old woman: \u201cthe Commune will never\r\nlet you enter the gates of this town again, if you set foot in that\r\ntraitorous Pisa. But you shall not go; I will raise the neighbours; I\r\nwill declare you mad\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cGegia, no more of this! Here is all the money I have. Before I go, I\r\nwill send your Cousin \u2019Nunziata to you. I must go. It is not the\r\nGhibelline cause, or Corradino, that obliges me to risk your ease and\r\ncomforts; but the life of one of the Elisei is at stake; and if I can\r\nsave him, would you have me rest here, and afterwards curse you and the\r\nhour when I was born?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! is he\u2014\u2014? But no; there is none among the Elisei so young as he;\r\nand none so lovely, except her whom these arms carried when an\r\ninfant\u2014but she is a female. No, no; this is a tale trumped up to deceive\r\nme and gain my consent; but you shall never have it. Mind that! you will\r\nnever have it! and I prophesy that if you do go, your journey will be\r\nthe death of both of us.\u201d She wept bitterly. Cincolo kissed her aged\r\ncheek, and mingled his tears with hers; and then recommending her to the\r\ncare of the Virgin and the saints, he quitted her; while grief choked\r\nher utterance, the name of the Elisei had deprived her of all energy to\r\nresist his purpose.\r\n\r\nIt was four in the morning before the gates of Florence were opened and\r\nCincolo could leave the city. At first he availed himself of the carts\r\nof the _contadini_ to advance on his journey; but as he drew near Pisa,\r\nall modes of conveyance ceased, and he was obliged to take by-roads, and\r\nact cautiously, not to fall into the hands of the Florentine outposts,\r\nor of some fierce Ghibelline, who might suspect him, and have him\r\ncarried before the Podesta of the village; for if once suspected and\r\nsearched, the packet addressed to Corradino would convict him, and he\r\nwould pay for his temerity with his life. Having arrived at Vico Pisano,\r\nhe found a troop of Pisan horse there on guard; he was known to many of\r\nthe soldiers, and he obtained a conveyance for Pisa; but it was night\r\nbefore he arrived. He gave the Ghibelline watchword, and was admitted\r\nwithin the gates. He asked for Prince Corradino: he was in the city, at\r\nthe palace of the Lanfranchi. He crossed the Arno, and was admitted into\r\nthe palace by the soldiers who guarded the door.\r\n\r\nCorradino had just returned from a successful skirmish in the Lucchese\r\nstates, and was reposing; but when Count Gherardo Doneratico, his\r\nprincipal attendant, saw the seal of the packet, he immediately ushered\r\nthe bearer into a small room, where the prince lay on a fox\u2019s skin\r\nthrown upon the pavement. The mind of Cincolo had been so bewildered by\r\nthe rapidity of the events of the preceding night, by fatigue and want\r\nof sleep, that he had overwrought himself to believe that the stranger\r\nyouth was indeed Corradino; and when he had heard that that prince was\r\nin Pisa, by a strange disorder of ideas he still imagined that he and\r\nRicciardo were the same; that the black litter was a phantom, and his\r\nfears ungrounded. The first sight of Corradino, his fair hair and round\r\nSaxon features, destroyed this idea: it was replaced by a feeling of\r\ndeep anguish, when Count Gherardo, announcing him, said, \u201cOne who brings\r\na letter from Madonna Despina dei Elisei, waits upon your Highness.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old man sprang forward, uncontrolled by the respect he would\r\notherwise have felt for one of so high lineage as Corradino. \u201cFrom\r\nDespina! Did you say from her? Oh! unsay your words! Not from my\r\nbeloved, lost foster-child.\u201d\r\n\r\nTears rolled down his cheeks. Corradino, a youth of fascinating\r\ngentleness, attempted to reassure him. \u201cOh! my gracious Lord,\u201d cried\r\nCincolo, \u201copen that packet, and see if it be from my blessed child\u2014if in\r\nthe disguise of Ricciardo I led her to destruction.\u201d He wrung his hands.\r\nCorradino, pale as death with fear for the destiny of his lovely and\r\nadventurous friend, broke the seal. The packet contained an inner\r\nenvelope without any direction, and a letter, which Corradino read,\r\nwhile horror convulsed every feature. He gave it to Gherardo. \u201cIt is\r\nindeed from her. She says that the bearer can relate all that the world\r\nwill probably know of her fate. And you old man, who weep so bitterly,\r\nyou to whom my best and lovely friend refers me, tell me what you know\r\nof her!\u201d\r\n\r\nCincolo told his story in broken accents. \u201cMay these eyes be for ever\r\nblinded!\u201d he cried, when he had concluded, \u201cthat knew not Despina in\r\nthose soft looks and heavenly smiles. Dotard that I am! When my wife\r\nrailed at your family and princely self, and the sainted Manfred, why\r\ndid I not read her secret in her forbearance? Would she have forgiven\r\nthose words in any but her who had nursed her infancy, and been a mother\r\nto her when Madonna Pia died? And when she taxed Bosticchi with her\r\nfather\u2019s death, I, blind fool, did not see the spirit of the Elisei in\r\nher eyes. My Lord, I have but one favour to ask you. Let me hear her\r\nletter, that I may judge from that what hopes remain;\u2014but there are\r\nnone\u2014none.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRead to him, my dear count,\u201d said the prince; \u201cI will not fear as he\r\nfears. I dare not fear that one so lovely and beloved is sacrificed for\r\nmy worthless cause.\u201d Gherardo read the letter.\r\n\r\n    \u201cCincolo de\u2019 Becari, my foster-father, will deliver this letter into\r\n    your hands, my respected and dear Corradino. The Countess Elizabeth\r\n    has urged me to my present undertaking; I hope nothing from it,\r\n    except to labour for your cause, and perhaps, through its event, to\r\n    quit somewhat earlier a life which is but a grievous trial to my\r\n    weak mind. I go to endeavour to arouse the feelings of fidelity and\r\n    generosity in the soul of the traitor Lostendardo; I go to place\r\n    myself in his hands, and I do not hope to escape from them again.\r\n    Corradino, my last prayer will be for your success. Mourn not for\r\n    one who goes home after a long and weary exile. Burn the enclosed\r\n    packet without opening it. The Mother of God protect thee!\u201d\r\n\r\n                        \u201cDESPINA.\u201d\r\n\r\nCorradino had wept as this epistle was reading, but then, starting up,\r\nhe said, \u201cTo revenge or death! we may yet save her!\u201d\r\n\r\nA blight had fallen on the house of Swabia, and all their enterprises\r\nwere blasted. Beloved by their subjects, noble, and with every advantage\r\nof right on their side, except those the Church bestowed, they were\r\ndefeated in every attempt to defend themselves against a foreigner and a\r\ntyrant, who ruled by force of arms, and those in the hands of a few\r\nonly, over an extensive and warlike territory. The young and daring\r\nCorradino was also fated to perish in this contest. Having overcome the\r\ntroops of his adversary in Tuscany, he advanced towards his kingdom with\r\nthe highest hopes. His arch-enemy, Pope Clement IV., had shut himself up\r\nin Viterbo, and was guarded by a numerous garrison. Corradino passed in\r\ntriumph and hope before the town, and proudly drew out his troops before\r\nit, to display to the Holy Father his forces, and humiliate him by this\r\nshow of success. The cardinals, who beheld the lengthened line and good\r\norder of the army, hastened to the papal palace. Clement was in his\r\noratory praying. The frightened monks, with pale looks, related how the\r\nexcommunicated heretic dared to menace the town where the Holy Father\r\nhimself resided; adding, that if the insult were carried to the pitch of\r\nan assault, it might prove dangerous warfare. The pope smiled\r\ncontemptuously. \u201cDo not fear,\u201d he said; \u201cthe projects of these men will\r\ndissipate in smoke.\u201d He then went on the ramparts, and saw Corradino and\r\nFrederic of Austria, who defiled the line of knights in the plain below.\r\nHe watched them for a time; then turning to his cardinals, he said,\r\n\u201cThey are victims, who permit themselves to be led to sacrifice.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis words were a prophecy. Notwithstanding the first successes of\r\nCorradino, and the superior numbers of his army, he was defeated by the\r\nartifice of Charles in a pitched battle. He escaped from the field, and,\r\nwith a few friends, arrived at a tower called Asturi, which belonged to\r\nthe family of Frangipani, of Rome. Here he hired a vessel, embarked, and\r\nput out to sea, directing his course for Sicily, which, having rebelled\r\nagainst Charles, would, he hoped, receive him with joy. They were\r\nalready under weigh, when one of the family of the Frangipani, seeing a\r\nvessel filled with Germans making all sail from shore, suspected that\r\nthey were fugitives from the battle of Taglicozzo. He followed them in\r\nother vessels, and took them all prisoners. The person of Corradino was\r\na rich prey for him; he delivered him into the hands of his rival, and\r\nwas rewarded by the donation of a fief near Benevento.\r\n\r\nThe dastardly spirit of Charles instigated him to the basest revenge;\r\nand the same tragedy was acted on those shores which has been renewed in\r\nour days. A daring and illustrious prince was sacrificed with the mock\r\nforms of justice, at the sanguinary altar of tyranny and hypocrisy.\r\nCorradino was tried. One of his judges alone, a Proven\u00e7al, dared to\r\ncondemn him, and he paid with his life the forfeit of his baseness. For\r\nscarcely had he, solitary among his fellows, pronounced the sentence of\r\ndeath against this prince, than Robert of Flanders, the brother-in-law\r\nof Charles himself, struck him on the breast with a staff, crying, \u201cIt\r\nbehoves not thee, wretch, to condemn to death so noble and worthy a\r\nknight.\u201d The judge fell dead in the presence of the king, who dared not\r\navenge his creature.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of October Corradino and his friends were led out to die in\r\nthe market-place of Naples, by the seaside. Charles was present with all\r\nhis court, and an immense multitude surrounded the triumphant king, and\r\nhis more royal adversary, about to suffer an ignominious death. The\r\nfunereal procession approached its destination. Corradino, agitated, but\r\ncontrolling his agitation, was drawn in an open car. After him came a\r\nclose litter, hung with black, with no sign to tell who was within. The\r\nDuke of Austria and several other illustrious victims followed. The\r\nguard that conducted them to the scaffold was headed by Lostendardo; a\r\nmalicious triumph laughed in his eyes, and he rode near the litter,\r\nlooking from time to time first at it and then at Corradino, with the\r\ndark look of a tormenting fiend. The procession stopped at the foot of\r\nthe scaffold, and Corradino looked at the flashing light which every now\r\nand then arose from Vesuvius, and threw its reflection on the sea. The\r\nsun had not yet risen, but the halo of its approach illuminated the bay\r\nof Naples, its mountains, and its islands. The summits of the distant\r\nhills of Bai\u00e6 gleamed with its first beams. Corradino thought, \u201cBy the\r\ntime those rays arrive here, and shadows are cast from the persons of\r\nthese men\u2014princes and peasants\u2014around me, my living spirit will be\r\nshadowless.\u201d Then he turned his eyes on the companions of his fate, and\r\nfor the first time he saw the silent and dark litter that accompanied\r\nthem. At first he thought, \u201cIt is my coffin.\u201d But then he recollected\r\nthe disappearance of Despina, and would have sprang towards it. His\r\nguards stopped him; he looked up, and his glance met that of\r\nLostendardo, who smiled\u2014a smile of dread; but the feeling of religion\r\nwhich had before calmed him again descended on him; he thought that her\r\nsufferings, as well as his, would soon be over.\r\n\r\nThey were already over; and the silence of the grave is upon those\r\nevents which had occurred since Cincolo beheld her carried out of\r\nFlorence, until now that she was led by her fierce enemy to behold the\r\ndeath of the nephew of Manfred. She must have endured much; for when, as\r\nCorradino advanced to the front of the scaffold, the litter being placed\r\nopposite to it, Lostendardo ordered the curtains to be withdrawn, the\r\nwhite hand that hung inanimate from the side was thin as a winter leaf,\r\nand her fair face, pillowed by the thick knots of her dark hair, was\r\nsunken and ashy pale, while you could see the deep blue of her eyes\r\nstruggle through the closed eyelids. She was still in the attire in\r\nwhich she had presented herself at the house of Cincolo. Perhaps her\r\ntormentor thought that her appearance as a youth would attract less\r\ncompassion than if a lovely woman were thus dragged to so unnatural a\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nCorradino was kneeling and praying when her form was thus exposed. He\r\nsaw her, and saw that she was dead! About to die himself; about, pure\r\nand innocent, to die ignominiously, while his base conqueror, in pomp\r\nand glory, was spectator of his death, he did not pity those who were at\r\npeace; his compassion belonged to the living alone; and as he arose from\r\nhis prayer he exclaimed, \u201cMy beloved mother, what profound sorrow will\r\nthe news thou art about to hear cause thee!\u201d He looked upon the living\r\nmultitude around him, and saw that the hard-visaged partisans of the\r\nusurper wept; he heard the sobs of his oppressed and conquered subjects;\r\nso he drew his glove from his hand and threw it among the crowd, in\r\ntoken that he still held his cause good, and submitted his head to the\r\naxe.\r\n\r\nDuring many years after those events, Lostendardo enjoyed wealth, rank,\r\nand power. When suddenly, while at the summit of glory and prosperity,\r\nhe withdrew from the world, took the vows of a severe order in a convent\r\nin one of the desolate and unhealthy plains by the sea-shore in\r\nCalabria; and after having gained the character of a saint, through a\r\nlife of self-inflicted torture, he died murmuring the names of\r\nCorradino, Manfred, and Despina.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VIII.\r\n\r\n                         _THE MORTAL IMMORTAL._\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY 16, 1833.\u2014This is a memorable anniversary for me; on it I complete\r\nmy three hundred and twenty-third year!\r\n\r\nThe Wandering Jew?\u2014certainly not. More than eighteen centuries have\r\npassed over his head. In comparison with him, I am a very young\r\nImmortal.\r\n\r\nAm I, then, immortal? This is a question which I have asked myself, by\r\nday and night, for now three hundred and three years, and yet cannot\r\nanswer it. I detected a grey hair amidst my brown locks this very\r\nday\u2014that surely signifies decay. Yet it may have remained concealed\r\nthere for three hundred years\u2014for some persons have become entirely\r\nwhite-headed before twenty years of age.\r\n\r\nI will tell my story, and my reader shall judge for me. I will tell my\r\nstory, and so contrive to pass some few hours of a long eternity, become\r\nso wearisome to me. For ever! Can it be? to live for ever! I have heard\r\nof enchantments, in which the victims were plunged into a deep sleep, to\r\nwake, after a hundred years, as fresh as ever: I have heard of the Seven\r\nSleepers\u2014thus to be immortal would not be so burthensome: but, oh! the\r\nweight of never-ending time\u2014the tedious passage of the still-succeeding\r\nhours! How happy was the fabled Nourjahad!\u2014But to my task.\r\n\r\nAll the world has heard of Cornelius Agrippa. His memory is as immortal\r\nas his arts have made me. All the world has also heard of his scholar,\r\nwho, unawares, raised the foul fiend during his master\u2019s absence, and\r\nwas destroyed by him. The report, true or false, of this accident, was\r\nattended with many inconveniences to the renowned philosopher. All his\r\nscholars at once deserted him\u2014his servants disappeared. He had no one\r\nnear him to put coals on his ever-burning fires while he slept, or to\r\nattend to the changeful colours of his medicines while he studied.\r\nExperiment after experiment failed, because one pair of hands was\r\ninsufficient to complete them: the dark spirits laughed at him for not\r\nbeing able to retain a single mortal in his service.\r\n\r\nI was then very young\u2014very poor\u2014and very much in love. I had been for\r\nabout a year the pupil of Cornelius, though I was absent when this\r\naccident took place. On my return, my friends implored me not to return\r\nto the alchymist\u2019s abode. I trembled as I listened to the dire tale they\r\ntold; I required no second warning; and when Cornelius came and offered\r\nme a purse of gold if I would remain under his roof, I felt as if Satan\r\nhimself tempted me. My teeth chattered\u2014my hair stood on end;\u2014I ran off\r\nas fast as my trembling knees would permit.\r\n\r\nMy failing steps were directed whither for two years they had every\r\nevening been attracted,\u2014a gently bubbling spring of pure living water,\r\nbeside which lingered a dark-haired girl, whose beaming eyes were fixed\r\non the path I was accustomed each night to tread. I cannot remember the\r\nhour when I did not love Bertha; we had been neighbours and playmates\r\nfrom infancy,\u2014her parents, like mine, were of humble life, yet\r\nrespectable,\u2014our attachment had been a source of pleasure to them. In an\r\nevil hour, a malignant fever carried off both her father and mother, and\r\nBertha became an orphan. She would have found a home beneath my paternal\r\nroof, but, unfortunately, the old lady of the near castle, rich,\r\nchildless, and solitary, declared her intention to adopt her. Henceforth\r\nBertha was clad in silk\u2014inhabited a marble palace\u2014and was looked on as\r\nbeing highly favoured by fortune. But in her new situation among her new\r\nassociates, Bertha remained true to the friend of her humbler days; she\r\noften visited the cottage of my father, and when forbidden to go\r\nthither, she would stray towards the neighbouring wood, and meet me\r\nbeside its shady fountain.\r\n\r\nShe often declared that she owed no duty to her new protectress equal in\r\nsanctity to that which bound us. Yet still I was too poor to marry, and\r\nshe grew weary of being tormented on my account. She had a haughty but\r\nan impatient spirit, and grew angry at the obstacles that prevented our\r\nunion. We met now after an absence, and she had been sorely beset while\r\nI was away; she complained bitterly, and almost reproached me for being\r\npoor. I replied hastily,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI am honest, if I am poor!\u2014were I not, I might soon become rich!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis exclamation produced a thousand questions. I feared to shock her by\r\nowning the truth, but she drew it from me; and then, casting a look of\r\ndisdain on me, she said,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou pretend to love, and you fear to face the Devil for my sake!\u201d\r\n\r\nI protested that I had only dreaded to offend her;\u2014while she dwelt on\r\nthe magnitude of the reward that I should receive. Thus\r\nencouraged\u2014shamed by her\u2014led on by love and hope, laughing at my late\r\nfears, with quick steps and a light heart, I returned to accept the\r\noffers of the alchymist, and was instantly installed in my office.\r\n\r\nA year passed away. I became possessed of no insignificant sum of money.\r\nCustom had banished my fears. In spite of the most painful vigilance, I\r\nhad never detected the trace of a cloven foot; nor was the studious\r\nsilence of our abode ever disturbed by demoniac howls. I still continued\r\nmy stolen interviews with Bertha, and Hope dawned on me\u2014Hope\u2014but not\r\nperfect joy; for Bertha fancied that love and security were enemies, and\r\nher pleasure was to divide them in my bosom. Though true of heart, she\r\nwas somewhat of a coquette in manner; and I was jealous as a Turk. She\r\nslighted me in a thousand ways, yet would never acknowledge herself to\r\nbe in the wrong. She would drive me mad with anger, and then force me to\r\nbeg her pardon. Sometimes she fancied that I was not sufficiently\r\nsubmissive, and then she had some story of a rival, favoured by her\r\nprotectress. She was surrounded by silk-clad youths\u2014the rich and gay.\r\nWhat chance had the sad-robed scholar of Cornelius compared with these?\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, the philosopher made such large demands upon my time,\r\nthat I was unable to meet her as I was wont. He was engaged in some\r\nmighty work, and I was forced to remain, day and night, feeding his\r\nfurnaces and watching his chemical preparations. Bertha waited for me in\r\nvain at the fountain. Her haughty spirit fired at this neglect; and when\r\nat last I stole out during the few short minutes allotted to me for\r\nslumber, and hoped to be consoled by her, she received me with disdain,\r\ndismissed me in scorn, and vowed that any man should possess her hand\r\nrather than he who could not be in two places at once for her sake. She\r\nwould be revenged! And truly she was. In my dingy retreat I heard that\r\nshe had been hunting, attended by Albert Hoffer. Albert Hoffer was\r\nfavoured by her protectress; and the three passed in cavalcade before my\r\nsmoky window. Methought that they mentioned my name; it was followed by\r\na laugh of derision, as her dark eyes glanced contemptuously towards my\r\nabode.\r\n\r\nJealousy, with all its venom and all its misery, entered my breast. Now\r\nI shed a torrent of tears, to think that I should never call her mine;\r\nand, anon, I imprecated a thousand curses on her inconstancy. Yet, still\r\nI must stir the fires of the alchymist, still attend on the changes of\r\nhis unintelligible medicines.\r\n\r\nCornelius had watched for three days and nights, nor closed his eyes.\r\nThe progress of his alembics was slower than he expected: in spite of\r\nhis anxiety, sleep weighed upon his eyelids. Again and again he threw\r\noff drowsiness with more than human energy; again and again it stole\r\naway his senses. He eyed his crucibles wistfully. \u201cNot ready yet,\u201d he\r\nmurmured; \u201cwill another night pass before the work is accomplished?\r\nWinzy, you are vigilant\u2014you are faithful\u2014you have slept, my boy\u2014you\r\nslept last night. Look at that glass vessel. The liquid it contains is\r\nof a soft rose-colour: the moment it begins to change its hue, awaken\r\nme\u2014till then I may close my eyes. First, it will turn white, and then\r\nemit golden flashes; but wait not till then; when the rose-colour fades,\r\nrouse me.\u201d I scarcely heard the last words, muttered, as they were, in\r\nsleep. Even then he did not quite yield to nature. \u201cWinzy, my boy,\u201d he\r\nagain said, \u201cdo not touch the vessel\u2014do not put it to your lips; it is a\r\nphilter\u2014a philter to cure love; you would not cease to love your\r\nBertha\u2014beware to drink!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd he slept. His venerable head sunk on his breast, and I scarce heard\r\nhis regular breathing. For a few minutes I watched the vessel\u2014the rosy\r\nhue of the liquid remained unchanged. Then my thoughts wandered\u2014they\r\nvisited the fountain, and dwelt on a thousand charming scenes never to\r\nbe renewed\u2014never! Serpents and adders were in my heart as the word\r\n\u201cNever!\u201d half formed itself on my lips. False girl!\u2014false and cruel!\r\nNever more would she smile on me as that evening she smiled on Albert.\r\nWorthless, detested woman! I would not remain unrevenged\u2014she should see\r\nAlbert expire at her feet\u2014she should die beneath my vengeance. She had\r\nsmiled in disdain and triumph\u2014she knew my wretchedness and her power.\r\nYet what power had she?\u2014the power of exciting my hate\u2014my utter\r\nscorn\u2014my\u2014oh, all but indifference! Could I attain that\u2014could I regard\r\nher with careless eyes, transferring my rejected love to one fairer and\r\nmore true, that were indeed a victory!\r\n\r\nA bright flash darted before my eyes. I had forgotten the medicine of\r\nthe adept; I gazed on it with wonder: flashes of admirable beauty, more\r\nbright than those which the diamond emits when the sun\u2019s rays are on it,\r\nglanced from the surface of the liquid; an odour the most fragrant and\r\ngrateful stole over my sense; the vessel seemed one globe of living\r\nradiance, lovely to the eye, and most inviting to the taste. The first\r\nthought, instinctively inspired by the grosser sense, was, I will\u2014I must\r\ndrink. I raised the vessel to my lips. \u201cIt will cure me of love\u2014of\r\ntorture!\u201d Already I had quaffed half of the most delicious liquor ever\r\ntasted by the palate of man, when the philosopher stirred. I started\u2014I\r\ndropped the glass\u2014the fluid flamed and glanced along the floor, while I\r\nfelt Cornelius\u2019s gripe at my throat, as he shrieked aloud, \u201cWretch! you\r\nhave destroyed the labour of my life!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe philosopher was totally unaware that I had drunk any portion of his\r\ndrug. His idea was, and I gave a tacit assent to it, that I had raised\r\nthe vessel from curiosity, and that, frighted at its brightness, and the\r\nflashes of intense light it gave forth, I had let it fall. I never\r\nundeceived him. The fire of the medicine was quenched\u2014the fragrance died\r\naway\u2014he grew calm, as a philosopher should under the heaviest trials,\r\nand dismissed me to rest.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to describe the sleep of glory and bliss which bathed\r\nmy soul in paradise during the remaining hours of that memorable night.\r\nWords would be faint and shallow types of my enjoyment, or of the\r\ngladness that possessed my bosom when I woke. I trod air\u2014my thoughts\r\nwere in heaven. Earth appeared heaven, and my inheritance upon it was to\r\nbe one trance of delight. \u201cThis it is to be cured of love,\u201d I thought;\r\n\u201cI will see Bertha this day, and she will find her lover cold and\r\nregardless; too happy to be disdainful, yet how utterly indifferent to\r\nher!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe hours danced away. The philosopher, secure that he had once\r\nsucceeded, and believing that he might again, began to concoct the same\r\nmedicine once more. He was shut up with his books and drugs, and I had a\r\nholiday. I dressed myself with care; I looked in an old but polished\r\nshield, which served me for a mirror; methought my good looks had\r\nwonderfully improved. I hurried beyond the precincts of the town, joy in\r\nmy soul, the beauty of heaven and earth around me. I turned my steps\r\ntowards the castle\u2014I could look on its lofty turrets with lightness of\r\nheart, for I was cured of love. My Bertha saw me afar off, as I came up\r\nthe avenue. I know not what sudden impulse animated her bosom, but at\r\nthe sight, she sprung with a light fawn-like bound down the marble\r\nsteps, and was hastening towards me. But I had been perceived by another\r\nperson. The old high-born hag, who called herself her protectress, and\r\nwas her tyrant, had seen me also; she hobbled, panting, up the terrace;\r\na page, as ugly as herself, held up her train, and fanned her as she\r\nhurried along, and stopped my fair girl with a \u201cHow, now, my bold\r\nmistress? whither so fast? Back to your cage\u2014hawks are abroad!\u201d\r\n\r\nBertha clasped her hands\u2014her eyes were still bent on my approaching\r\nfigure. I saw the contest. How I abhorred the old crone who checked\r\nthe kind impulses of my Bertha\u2019s softening heart. Hitherto, respect\r\nfor her rank had caused me to avoid the lady of the castle; now I\r\ndisdained such trivial considerations. I was cured of love, and lifted\r\nabove all human fears; I hastened forwards, and soon reached the\r\nterrace. How lovely Bertha looked! her eyes flashing fire, her cheeks\r\nglowing with impatience and anger, she was a thousand times more\r\ngraceful and charming than ever. I no longer loved\u2014Oh no! I\r\nadored\u2014worshipped\u2014idolized her!\r\n\r\nShe had that morning been persecuted, with more than usual vehemence, to\r\nconsent to an immediate marriage with my rival. She was reproached with\r\nthe encouragement that she had shown him\u2014she was threatened with being\r\nturned out of doors with disgrace and shame. Her proud spirit rose in\r\narms at the threat; but when she remembered the scorn that she had\r\nheaped upon me, and how, perhaps, she had thus lost one whom she now\r\nregarded as her only friend, she wept with remorse and rage. At that\r\nmoment I appeared. \u201cOh, Winzy!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201ctake me to your mother\u2019s\r\ncot; swiftly let me leave the detested luxuries and wretchedness of this\r\nnoble dwelling\u2014take me to poverty and happiness.\u201d\r\n\r\nI clasped her in my arms with transport. The old dame was speechless\r\nwith fury, and broke forth into invective only when we were far on our\r\nroad to my natal cottage. My mother received the fair fugitive, escaped\r\nfrom a gilt cage to nature and liberty, with tenderness and joy; my\r\nfather, who loved her, welcomed her heartily; it was a day of rejoicing,\r\nwhich did not need the addition of the celestial potion of the alchymist\r\nto steep me in delight.\r\n\r\nSoon after this eventful day, I became the husband of Bertha. I ceased\r\nto be the scholar of Cornelius, but I continued his friend. I always\r\nfelt grateful to him for having, unawares, procured me that delicious\r\ndraught of a divine elixir, which, instead of curing me of love (sad\r\ncure! solitary and joyless remedy for evils which seem blessings to the\r\nmemory), had inspired me with courage and resolution, thus winning for\r\nme an inestimable treasure in my Bertha.\r\n\r\nI often called to mind that period of trance-like inebriation with\r\nwonder. The drink of Cornelius had not fulfilled the task for which he\r\naffirmed that it had been prepared, but its effects were more potent and\r\nblissful than words can express. They had faded by degrees, yet they\r\nlingered long\u2014and painted life in hues of splendour. Bertha often\r\nwondered at my lightness of heart and unaccustomed gaiety; for, before,\r\nI had been rather serious, or even sad, in my disposition. She loved me\r\nthe better for my cheerful temper, and our days were winged by joy.\r\n\r\nFive years afterwards I was suddenly summoned to the bedside of the\r\ndying Cornelius. He had sent for me in haste, conjuring my instant\r\npresence. I found him stretched on his pallet, enfeebled even to death;\r\nall of life that yet remained animated his piercing eyes, and they were\r\nfixed on a glass vessel, full of a roseate liquid.\r\n\r\n\u201cBehold,\u201d he said, in a broken and inward voice, \u201cthe vanity of human\r\nwishes! a second time my hopes are about to be crowned, a second time\r\nthey are destroyed. Look at that liquor\u2014you remember five years ago I\r\nhad prepared the same, with the same success;\u2014then, as now, my thirsting\r\nlips expected to taste the immortal elixir\u2014you dashed it from me! and at\r\npresent it is too late.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe spoke with difficulty, and fell back on his pillow. I could not help\r\nsaying,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHow, revered master, can a cure for love restore you to life?\u201d\r\n\r\nA faint smile gleamed across his face as I listened earnestly to his\r\nscarcely intelligible answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cA cure for love and for all things\u2014the Elixir of Immortality. Ah! if\r\nnow I might drink, I should live for ever!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, a golden flash gleamed from the fluid; a well-remembered\r\nfragrance stole over the air; he raised himself, all weak as he\r\nwas\u2014strength seemed miraculously to re-enter his frame\u2014he stretched\r\nforth his hand\u2014a loud explosion startled me\u2014a ray of fire shot up from\r\nthe elixir, and the glass vessel which contained it was shivered to\r\natoms! I turned my eyes towards the philosopher; he had fallen back\u2014his\r\neyes were glassy\u2014his features rigid\u2014he was dead!\r\n\r\nBut I lived, and was to live for ever! So said the unfortunate\r\nalchymist, and for a few days I believed his words. I remembered the\r\nglorious intoxication that had followed my stolen draught. I reflected\r\non the change I had felt in my frame\u2014in my soul. The bounding elasticity\r\nof the one\u2014the buoyant lightness of the other. I surveyed myself in a\r\nmirror, and could perceive no change in my features during the space of\r\nthe five years which had elapsed. I remembered the radiant hues and\r\ngrateful scent of that delicious beverage\u2014worthy the gift it was capable\r\nof bestowing\u2014I was, then, IMMORTAL!\r\n\r\nA few days after I laughed at my credulity. The old proverb, that \u201ca\r\nprophet is least regarded in his own country,\u201d was true with respect to\r\nme and my defunct master. I loved him as a man\u2014I respected him as a\r\nsage\u2014but I derided the notion that he could command the powers of\r\ndarkness, and laughed at the superstitious fears with which he was\r\nregarded by the vulgar. He was a wise philosopher, but had no\r\nacquaintance with any spirits but those clad in flesh and blood. His\r\nscience was simply human; and human science, I soon persuaded myself,\r\ncould never conquer nature\u2019s laws so far as to imprison the soul for\r\never within its carnal habitation. Cornelius had brewed a\r\nsoul-refreshing drink\u2014more inebriating than wine\u2014sweeter and more\r\nfragrant than any fruit: it possessed probably strong medicinal powers,\r\nimparting gladness to the heart and vigour to the limbs; but its effects\r\nwould wear out; already were they diminished in my frame. I was a lucky\r\nfellow to have quaffed health and joyous spirits, and perhaps long life,\r\nat my master\u2019s hands; but my good fortune ended there: longevity was far\r\ndifferent from immortality.\r\n\r\nI continued to entertain this belief for many years. Sometimes a thought\r\nstole across me\u2014Was the alchymist indeed deceived? But my habitual\r\ncredence was, that I should meet the fate of all the children of Adam at\r\nmy appointed time\u2014a little late, but still at a natural age. Yet it was\r\ncertain that I retained a wonderfully youthful look. I was laughed at\r\nfor my vanity in consulting the mirror so often, but I consulted it in\r\nvain\u2014my brow was untrenched\u2014my cheeks\u2014my eyes\u2014my whole person continued\r\nas untarnished as in my twentieth year.\r\n\r\nI was troubled. I looked at the faded beauty of Bertha\u2014I seemed more\r\nlike her son. By degrees our neighbours began to make similar\r\nobservations, and I found at last that I went by the name of the Scholar\r\nbewitched. Bertha herself grew uneasy. She became jealous and peevish,\r\nand at length she began to question me. We had no children; we were all\r\nin all to each other; and though, as she grew older, her vivacious\r\nspirit became a little allied to ill-temper, and her beauty sadly\r\ndiminished, I cherished her in my heart as the mistress I had idolized,\r\nthe wife I had sought and won with such perfect love.\r\n\r\nAt last our situation became intolerable: Bertha was fifty\u2014I twenty\r\nyears of age. I had, in very shame, in some measure adopted the habits\r\nof a more advanced age; I no longer mingled in the dance among the young\r\nand gay, but my heart bounded along with them while I restrained my\r\nfeet; and a sorry figure I cut among the Nestors of our village. But\r\nbefore the time I mention, things were altered\u2014we were universally\r\nshunned; we were\u2014at least, I was\u2014reported to have kept up an iniquitous\r\nacquaintance with some of my former master\u2019s supposed friends. Poor\r\nBertha was pitied, but deserted. I was regarded with horror and\r\ndetestation.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done? we sat by our winter fire\u2014poverty had made itself\r\nfelt, for none would buy the produce of my farm; and often I had been\r\nforced to journey twenty miles, to some place where I was not known, to\r\ndispose of our property. It is true, we had saved something for an evil\r\nday\u2014that day was come.\r\n\r\nWe sat by our lone fireside\u2014the old-hearted youth and his antiquated\r\nwife. Again Bertha insisted on knowing the truth; she recapitulated all\r\nshe had ever heard said about me, and added her own observations. She\r\nconjured me to cast off the spell; she described how much more comely\r\ngrey hairs were than my chestnut locks; she descanted on the reverence\r\nand respect due to age\u2014how preferable to the slight regard paid to mere\r\nchildren: could I imagine that the despicable gifts of youth and good\r\nlooks outweighed disgrace, hatred, and scorn? Nay, in the end I should\r\nbe burnt as a dealer in the black art, while she, to whom I had not\r\ndeigned to communicate any portion of my good fortune, might be stoned\r\nas my accomplice. At length she insinuated that I must share my secret\r\nwith her, and bestow on her like benefits to those I myself enjoyed, or\r\nshe would denounce me\u2014and then she burst into tears.\r\n\r\nThus beset, methought it was the best way to tell the truth. I revealed\r\nit as tenderly as I could, and spoke only of a _very long life_, not of\r\nimmortality\u2014which representation, indeed, coincided best with my own\r\nideas. When I ended, I rose and said,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now, my Bertha, will you denounce the lover of your youth?\u2014You will\r\nnot, I know. But it is too hard, my poor wife, that you should suffer\r\nfrom my ill-luck and the accursed arts of Cornelius. I will leave\r\nyou\u2014you have wealth enough, and friends will return in my absence. I\r\nwill go; young as I seem, and strong as I am, I can work and gain my\r\nbread among strangers, unsuspected and unknown. I loved you in youth;\r\nGod is my witness that I would not desert you in age, but that your\r\nsafety and happiness require it.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took my cap and moved towards the door; in a moment Bertha\u2019s arms were\r\nround my neck, and her lips were pressed to mine. \u201cNo, my husband, my\r\nWinzy,\u201d she said, \u201cyou shall not go alone\u2014take me with you; we will\r\nremove from this place, and, as you say, among strangers we shall be\r\nunsuspected and safe. I am not so very old as quite to shame you, my\r\nWinzy; and I daresay the charm will soon wear off, and, with the\r\nblessing of God, you will become more elderly-looking, as is fitting;\r\nyou shall not leave me.\u201d\r\n\r\nI returned the good soul\u2019s embrace heartily. \u201cI will not, my Bertha; but\r\nfor your sake I had not thought of such a thing. I will be your true,\r\nfaithful husband while you are spared to me, and do my duty by you to\r\nthe last.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe next day we prepared secretly for our emigration. We were obliged to\r\nmake great pecuniary sacrifices\u2014it could not be helped. We realized a\r\nsum sufficient, at least, to maintain us while Bertha lived; and,\r\nwithout saying adieu to any one, quitted our native country to take\r\nrefuge in a remote part of western France.\r\n\r\nIt was a cruel thing to transport poor Bertha from her native village,\r\nand the friends of her youth, to a new country, new language, new\r\ncustoms. The strange secret of my destiny rendered this removal\r\nimmaterial to me; but I compassionated her deeply, and was glad to\r\nperceive that she found compensation for her misfortunes in a variety of\r\nlittle ridiculous circumstances. Away from all tell-tale chroniclers,\r\nshe sought to decrease the apparent disparity of our ages by a thousand\r\nfeminine arts\u2014rouge, youthful dress, and assumed juvenility of manner. I\r\ncould not be angry. Did not I myself wear a mask? Why quarrel with hers,\r\nbecause it was less successful? I grieved deeply when I remembered that\r\nthis was my Bertha, whom I had loved so fondly, and won with such\r\ntransport\u2014the dark-eyed, dark-haired girl, with smiles of enchanting\r\narchness and a step like a fawn\u2014this mincing, simpering, jealous old\r\nwoman. I should have revered her grey locks and withered cheeks; but\r\nthus!\u2014It was my work, I knew; but I did not the less deplore this type\r\nof human weakness.\r\n\r\nHer jealousy never slept. Her chief occupation was to discover that, in\r\nspite of outward appearances, I was myself growing old. I verily believe\r\nthat the poor soul loved me truly in her heart, but never had woman so\r\ntormenting a mode of displaying fondness. She would discern wrinkles in\r\nmy face and decrepitude in my walk, while I bounded along in youthful\r\nvigour, the youngest looking of twenty youths. I never dared address\r\nanother woman. On one occasion, fancying that the belle of the village\r\nregarded me with favouring eyes, she brought me a grey wig. Her constant\r\ndiscourse among her acquaintances was, that though I looked so young,\r\nthere was ruin at work within my frame; and she affirmed that the worst\r\nsymptom about me was my apparent health. My youth was a disease, she\r\nsaid, and I ought at all times to prepare, if not for a sudden and awful\r\ndeath, at least to awake some morning white-headed and bowed down with\r\nall the marks of advanced years. I let her talk\u2014I often joined in her\r\nconjectures. Her warnings chimed in with my never-ceasing speculations\r\nconcerning my state, and I took an earnest, though painful, interest in\r\nlistening to all that her quick wit and excited imagination could say on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nWhy dwell on these minute circumstances? We lived on for many long\r\nyears. Bertha became bedrid and paralytic; I nursed her as a mother\r\nmight a child. She grew peevish, and still harped upon one string\u2014of how\r\nlong I should survive her. It has ever been a source of consolation to\r\nme, that I performed my duty scrupulously towards her. She had been mine\r\nin youth, she was mine in age; and at last, when I heaped the sod over\r\nher corpse, I wept to feel that I had lost all that really bound me to\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nSince then how many have been my cares and woes, how few and empty my\r\nenjoyments! I pause here in my history\u2014I will pursue it no further. A\r\nsailor without rudder or compass, tossed on a stormy sea\u2014a traveller\r\nlost on a widespread heath, without landmark or stone to guide him\u2014such\r\nhave I been: more lost, more hopeless than either. A nearing ship, a\r\ngleam from some far cot, may save them; but I have no beacon except the\r\nhope of death.\r\n\r\nDeath! mysterious, ill-visaged friend of weak humanity! Why alone of all\r\nmortals have you cast me from your sheltering fold? Oh, for the peace of\r\nthe grave! the deep silence of the iron-bound tomb! that thought would\r\ncease to work in my brain, and my heart beat no more with emotions\r\nvaried only by new forms of sadness!\r\n\r\nAm I immortal? I return to my first question. In the first place, is it\r\nnot more probable that the beverage of the alchymist was fraught rather\r\nwith longevity than eternal life? Such is my hope. And then be it\r\nremembered, that I only drank _half_ of the potion prepared by him. Was\r\nnot the whole necessary to complete the charm? To have drained half the\r\nElixir of Immortality is but to be half-immortal\u2014my For-ever is thus\r\ntruncated and null.\r\n\r\nBut again, who shall number the years of the half of eternity? I often\r\ntry to imagine by what rule the infinite may be divided. Sometimes I\r\nfancy age advancing upon me. One grey hair I have found. Fool! do I\r\nlament? Yes, the fear of age and death often creeps coldly into my\r\nheart; and the more I live, the more I dread death, even while I abhor\r\nlife. Such an enigma is man\u2014born to perish\u2014when he wars, as I do,\r\nagainst the established laws of his nature.\r\n\r\nBut for this anomaly of feeling surely I might die: the medicine of the\r\nalchymist would not be proof against fire\u2014sword\u2014and the strangling\r\nwaters. I have gazed upon the blue depths of many a placid lake, and the\r\ntumultuous rushing of many a mighty river, and have said, peace inhabits\r\nthose waters; yet I have turned my steps away, to live yet another day.\r\nI have asked myself, whether suicide would be a crime in one to whom\r\nthus only the portals of the other world could be opened. I have done\r\nall, except presenting myself as a soldier or duellist, an object of\r\ndestruction to my\u2014no, _not_ my fellow-mortals, and therefore I have\r\nshrunk away. They are not my fellows. The inextinguishable power of life\r\nin my frame, and their ephemeral existence, places us wide as the poles\r\nasunder. I could not raise a hand against the meanest or the most\r\npowerful among them.\r\n\r\nThus I have lived on for many a year\u2014alone, and weary of myself\u2014desirous\r\nof death, yet never dying\u2014a mortal immortal. Neither ambition nor\r\navarice can enter my mind, and the ardent love that gnaws at my heart,\r\nnever to be returned\u2014never to find an equal on which to expend\r\nitself\u2014lives there only to torment me.\r\n\r\nThis very day I conceived a design by which I may end all\u2014without\r\nself-slaughter, without making another man a Cain\u2014an expedition, which\r\nmortal frame can never survive, even endued with the youth and strength\r\nthat inhabits mine. Thus I shall put my immortality to the test, and\r\nrest for ever\u2014or return, the wonder and benefactor of the human species.\r\n\r\nBefore I go, a miserable vanity has caused me to pen these pages. I\r\nwould not die, and leave no name behind. Three centuries have passed\r\nsince I quaffed the fatal beverage; another year shall not elapse\r\nbefore, encountering gigantic dangers\u2014warring with the powers of frost\r\nin their home\u2014beset by famine, toil, and tempest\u2014I yield this body, too\r\ntenacious a cage for a soul which thirsts for freedom, to the\r\ndestructive elements of air and water; or, if I survive, my name shall\r\nbe recorded as one of the most famous among the sons of men; and, my\r\ntask achieved, I shall adopt more resolute means, and, by scattering and\r\nannihilating the atoms that compose my frame, set at liberty the life\r\nimprisoned within, and so cruelly prevented from soaring from this dim\r\nearth to a sphere more congenial to its immortal essence.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IX.\r\n\r\n                           _TRANSFORMATION._\r\n\r\n              \u201cForthwith this frame of mine was wrench\u2019d\r\n                  With a woful agony,\r\n               Which forced me to begin my tale,\r\n                  And then it set me free.\r\n\r\n              \u201cSince then, at an uncertain hour,\r\n                 That agony returns;\r\n               And till my ghastly tale is told\r\n                 This heart within me burns.\u201d\r\n                             \u2014COLERIDGE\u2019S ANCIENT MARINER.\r\n\r\n\r\nI HAVE heard it said, that, when any strange, supernatural, and\r\nnecromantic adventure has occurred to a human being, that being, however\r\ndesirous he may be to conceal the same, feels at certain periods torn up\r\nas it were by an intellectual earthquake, and is forced to bare the\r\ninner depths of his spirit to another. I am a witness of the truth of\r\nthis. I have dearly sworn to myself never to reveal to human ears the\r\nhorrors to which I once, in excess of fiendly pride, delivered myself\r\nover. The holy man who heard my confession, and reconciled me to the\r\nChurch, is dead. None knows that once\u2014\r\n\r\nWhy should it not be thus? Why tell a tale of impious tempting of\r\nProvidence, and soul-subduing humiliation? Why? answer me, ye who are\r\nwise in the secrets of human nature! I only know that so it is; and in\r\nspite of strong resolve,\u2014of a pride that too much masters me\u2014of shame,\r\nand even of fear, so to render myself odious to my species,\u2014I must\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nGenoa! my birthplace\u2014proud city! looking upon the blue\r\nMediterranean\u2014dost thou remember me in my boyhood, when thy cliffs and\r\npromontories, thy bright sky and gay vineyards, were my world? Happy\r\ntime! when to the young heart the narrow-bounded universe, which leaves,\r\nby its very limitation, free scope to the imagination, enchains our\r\nphysical energies, and, sole period in our lives, innocence and\r\nenjoyment are united. Yet, who can look back to childhood, and not\r\nremember its sorrows and its harrowing fears? I was born with the most\r\nimperious, haughty, tameless spirit. I quailed before my father only;\r\nand he, generous and noble, but capricious and tyrannical, at once\r\nfostered and checked the wild impetuosity of my character, making\r\nobedience necessary, but inspiring no respect for the motives which\r\nguided his commands. To be a man, free, independent; or, in better\r\nwords, insolent and domineering, was the hope and prayer of my rebel\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nMy father had one friend, a wealthy Genoese noble, who in a political\r\ntumult was suddenly sentenced to banishment, and his property\r\nconfiscated. The Marchese Torella went into exile alone. Like my father,\r\nhe was a widower: he had one child, the almost infant Juliet, who was\r\nleft under my father\u2019s guardianship. I should certainly have been unkind\r\nto the lovely girl, but that I was forced by my position to become her\r\nprotector. A variety of childish incidents all tended to one point,\u2014to\r\nmake Juliet see in me a rock of defence; I in her, one who must perish\r\nthrough the soft sensibility of her nature too rudely visited, but for\r\nmy guardian care. We grew up together. The opening rose in May was not\r\nmore sweet than this dear girl. An irradiation of beauty was spread over\r\nher face. Her form, her step, her voice\u2014my heart weeps even now, to\r\nthink of all of relying, gentle, loving, and pure, that she enshrined.\r\nWhen I was eleven and Juliet eight years of age, a cousin of mine, much\r\nolder than either\u2014he seemed to us a man\u2014took great notice of my\r\nplaymate; he called her his bride, and asked her to marry him. She\r\nrefused, and he insisted, drawing her unwillingly towards him. With the\r\ncountenance and emotions of a maniac I threw myself on him\u2014I strove to\r\ndraw his sword\u2014I clung to his neck with the ferocious resolve to\r\nstrangle him: he was obliged to call for assistance to disengage himself\r\nfrom me. On that night I led Juliet to the chapel of our house: I made\r\nher touch the sacred relics\u2014I harrowed her child\u2019s heart, and profaned\r\nher child\u2019s lips with an oath, that she would be mine, and mine only.\r\n\r\nWell, those days passed away. Torella returned in a few years, and\r\nbecame wealthier and more prosperous than ever. When I was seventeen, my\r\nfather died; he had been magnificent to prodigality; Torella rejoiced\r\nthat my minority would afford an opportunity for repairing my fortunes.\r\nJuliet and I had been affianced beside my father\u2019s deathbed\u2014Torella was\r\nto be a second parent to me.\r\n\r\nI desired to see the world, and I was indulged. I went to Florence, to\r\nRome, to Naples; thence I passed to Toulon, and at length reached what\r\nhad long been the bourne of my wishes, Paris. There was wild work in\r\nParis then. The poor king, Charles the Sixth, now sane, now mad, now a\r\nmonarch, now an abject slave, was the very mockery of humanity. The\r\nqueen, the dauphin, the Duke of Burgundy, alternately friends and\r\nfoes,\u2014now meeting in prodigal feasts, now shedding blood in\r\nrivalry,\u2014were blind to the miserable state of their country, and the\r\ndangers that impended over it, and gave themselves wholly up to\r\ndissolute enjoyment or savage strife. My character still followed me. I\r\nwas arrogant and self-willed; I loved display, and above all, I threw\r\noff all control. My young friends were eager to foster passions which\r\nfurnished them with pleasures. I was deemed handsome\u2014I was master of\r\nevery knightly accomplishment. I was disconnected with any political\r\nparty. I grew a favourite with all: my presumption and arrogance was\r\npardoned in one so young: I became a spoiled child. Who could control\r\nme? not the letters and advice of Torella\u2014only strong necessity visiting\r\nme in the abhorred shape of an empty purse. But there were means to\r\nrefill this void. Acre after acre, estate after estate, I sold. My\r\ndress, my jewels, my horses and their caparisons, were almost unrivalled\r\nin gorgeous Paris, while the lands of my inheritance passed into\r\npossession of others.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Orleans was waylaid and murdered by the Duke of Burgundy.\r\nFear and terror possessed all Paris. The dauphin and the queen shut\r\nthemselves up; every pleasure was suspended. I grew weary of this state\r\nof things, and my heart yearned for my boyhood\u2019s haunts. I was nearly a\r\nbeggar, yet still I would go there, claim my bride, and rebuild my\r\nfortunes. A few happy ventures as a merchant would make me rich again.\r\nNevertheless, I would not return in humble guise. My last act was to\r\ndispose of my remaining estate near Albaro for half its worth, for ready\r\nmoney. Then I despatched all kinds of artificers, arras, furniture of\r\nregal splendour, to fit up the last relic of my inheritance, my palace\r\nin Genoa. I lingered a little longer yet, ashamed at the part of the\r\nprodigal returned, which I feared I should play. I sent my horses. One\r\nmatchless Spanish jennet I despatched to my promised bride: its\r\ncaparisons flamed with jewels and cloth of gold. In every part I caused\r\nto be entwined the initials of Juliet and her Guido. My present found\r\nfavour in hers and in her father\u2019s eyes.\r\n\r\nStill to return a proclaimed spendthrift, the mark of impertinent\r\nwonder, perhaps of scorn, and to encounter singly the reproaches or\r\ntaunts of my fellow-citizens, was no alluring prospect. As a shield\r\nbetween me and censure, I invited some few of the most reckless of my\r\ncomrades to accompany me: thus I went armed against the world, hiding a\r\nrankling feeling, half fear and half penitence, by bravado.\r\n\r\nI arrived in Genoa. I trod the pavement of my ancestral palace. My proud\r\nstep was no interpreter of my heart, for I deeply felt that, though\r\nsurrounded by every luxury, I was a beggar. The first step I took in\r\nclaiming Juliet must widely declare me such. I read contempt or pity in\r\nthe looks of all. I fancied that rich and poor, young and old, all\r\nregarded me with derision. Torella came not near me. No wonder that my\r\nsecond father should expect a son\u2019s deference from me in waiting first\r\non him. But, galled and stung by a sense of my follies and demerit, I\r\nstrove to throw the blame on others. We kept nightly orgies in Palazzo\r\nCarega. To sleepless, riotous nights followed listless, supine mornings.\r\nAt the Ave Maria we showed our dainty persons in the streets, scoffing\r\nat the sober citizens, casting insolent glances on the shrinking women.\r\nJuliet was not among them\u2014no, no; if she had been there, shame would\r\nhave driven me away, if love had not brought me to her feet.\r\n\r\nI grew tired of this. Suddenly I paid the Marchese a visit. He was at\r\nhis villa, one among the many which deck the suburb of San Pietro\r\nd\u2019Arena. It was the month of May, the blossoms of the fruit-trees were\r\nfading among thick, green foliage; the vines were shooting forth; the\r\nground strewed with the fallen olive blooms; the firefly was in the\r\nmyrtle hedge; heaven and earth wore a mantle of surpassing beauty.\r\nTorella welcomed me kindly, though seriously; and even his shade of\r\ndispleasure soon wore away. Some resemblance to my father\u2014some look and\r\ntone of youthful ingenuousness, softened the good old man\u2019s heart. He\r\nsent for his daughter\u2014he presented me to her as her betrothed. The\r\nchamber became hallowed by a holy light as she entered. Hers was that\r\ncherub look, those large, soft eyes, full dimpled cheeks, and mouth of\r\ninfantine sweetness, that expresses the rare union of happiness and\r\nlove. Admiration first possessed me; she is mine! was the second proud\r\nemotion, and my lips curled with haughty triumph. I had not been the\r\n_enfant g\u00e2t\u00e9_ of the beauties of France not to have learnt the art of\r\npleasing the soft heart of woman. If towards men I was overbearing, the\r\ndeference I paid to them was the more in contrast. I commenced my\r\ncourtship by the display of a thousand gallantries to Juliet, who, vowed\r\nto me from infancy, had never admitted the devotion of others; and who,\r\nthough accustomed to expressions of admiration, was uninitiated in the\r\nlanguage of lovers.\r\n\r\nFor a few days all went well. Torella never alluded to my extravagance;\r\nhe treated me as a favourite son. But the time came, as we discussed the\r\npreliminaries to my union with his daughter, when this fair face of\r\nthings should be overcast. A contract had been drawn up in my father\u2019s\r\nlifetime. I had rendered this, in fact, void by having squandered the\r\nwhole of the wealth which was to have been shared by Juliet and myself.\r\nTorella, in consequence, chose to consider this bond as cancelled, and\r\nproposed another, in which, though the wealth he bestowed was\r\nimmeasurably increased, there were so many restrictions as to the mode\r\nof spending it, that I, who saw independence only in free career being\r\ngiven to my own imperious will, taunted him as taking advantage of my\r\nsituation, and refused utterly to subscribe to his conditions. The old\r\nman mildly strove to recall me to reason. Roused pride became the tyrant\r\nof my thought: I listened with indignation\u2014I repelled him with disdain.\r\n\r\n\u201cJuliet, thou art mine! Did we not interchange vows in our innocent\r\nchildhood? Are we not one in the sight of God? and shall thy\r\ncold-hearted, cold-blooded father divide us? Be generous, my love, be\r\njust; take not away a gift, last treasure of thy Guido\u2014retract not thy\r\nvows\u2014let us defy the world, and, setting at nought the calculations of\r\nage, find in our mutual affection a refuge from every ill.\u201d\r\n\r\nFiend I must have been with such sophistry to endeavour to poison that\r\nsanctuary of holy thought and tender love. Juliet shrank from me\r\naffrighted. Her father was the best and kindest of men, and she strove\r\nto show me how, in obeying him, every good would follow. He would\r\nreceive my tardy submission with warm affection, and generous pardon\r\nwould follow my repentance;\u2014profitless words for a young and gentle\r\ndaughter to use to a man accustomed to make his will law, and to feel in\r\nhis own heart a despot so terrible and stern that he could yield\r\nobedience to nought save his own imperious desires! My resentment grew\r\nwith resistance; my wild companions were ready to add fuel to the flame.\r\nWe laid a plan to carry off Juliet. At first it appeared to be crowned\r\nwith success. Midway, on our return, we were overtaken by the agonized\r\nfather and his attendants. A conflict ensued. Before the city guard came\r\nto decide the victory in favour of our antagonists, two of Torella\u2019s\r\nservitors were dangerously wounded.\r\n\r\nThis portion of my history weighs most heavily with me. Changed man as I\r\nam, I abhor myself in the recollection. May none who hear this tale ever\r\nhave felt as I. A horse driven to fury by a rider armed with barbed\r\nspurs was not more a slave than I to the violent tyranny of my temper. A\r\nfiend possessed my soul, irritating it to madness. I felt the voice of\r\nconscience within me; but if I yielded to it for a brief interval, it\r\nwas only to be a moment after torn, as by a whirlwind, away\u2014borne along\r\non the stream of desperate rage\u2014the plaything of the storms engendered\r\nby pride. I was imprisoned, and, at the instance of Torella, set free.\r\nAgain I returned to carry off both him and his child to France, which\r\nhapless country, then preyed on by freebooters and gangs of lawless\r\nsoldiery, offered a grateful refuge to a criminal like me. Our plots\r\nwere discovered. I was sentenced to banishment; and, as my debts were\r\nalready enormous, my remaining property was put in the hands of\r\ncommissioners for their payment. Torella again offered his mediation,\r\nrequiring only my promise not to renew my abortive attempts on himself\r\nand his daughter. I spurned his offers, and fancied that I triumphed\r\nwhen I was thrust out from Genoa, a solitary and penniless exile. My\r\ncompanions were gone: they had been dismissed the city some weeks\r\nbefore, and were already in France. I was alone\u2014friendless, with neither\r\nsword at my side, nor ducat in my purse.\r\n\r\nI wandered along the sea-shore, a whirlwind of passion possessing and\r\ntearing my soul. It was as if a live coal had been set burning in my\r\nbreast. At first I meditated on what _I should do_. I would join a band\r\nof freebooters. Revenge!\u2014the word seemed balm to me; I hugged it,\r\ncaressed it, till, like a serpent, it stung me. Then again I would\r\nabjure and despise Genoa, that little corner of the world. I would\r\nreturn to Paris, where so many of my friends swarmed; where my services\r\nwould be eagerly accepted; where I would carve out fortune with my\r\nsword, and make my paltry birthplace and the false Torella rue the day\r\nwhen they drove me, a new Coriolanus, from her walls. I would return to\r\nParis\u2014thus on foot\u2014a beggar\u2014and present myself in my poverty to those I\r\nhad formerly entertained sumptuously? There was gall in the mere thought\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThe reality of things began to dawn upon my mind, bringing despair in\r\nits train. For several months I had been a prisoner: the evils of my\r\ndungeon had whipped my soul to madness, but they had subdued my\r\ncorporeal frame. I was weak and wan. Torella had used a thousand\r\nartifices to administer to my comfort; I had detected and scorned them\r\nall, and I reaped the harvest of my obduracy. What was to be done?\r\nShould I crouch before my foe, and sue for forgiveness?\u2014Die rather ten\r\nthousand deaths!\u2014Never should they obtain that victory! Hate\u2014I swore\r\neternal hate! Hate from whom?\u2014to whom?\u2014From a wandering outcast\u2014to a\r\nmighty noble! I and my feelings were nothing to them: already had they\r\nforgotten one so unworthy. And Juliet!\u2014her angel face and sylph-like\r\nform gleamed among the clouds of my despair with vain beauty; for I had\r\nlost her\u2014the glory and flower of the world! Another will call her\r\nhis!\u2014that smile of paradise will bless another!\r\n\r\nEven now my heart fails within me when I recur to this rout of\r\ngrim-visaged ideas. Now subdued almost to tears, now raving in my agony,\r\nstill I wandered along the rocky shore, which grew at each step wilder\r\nand more desolate. Hanging rocks and hoar precipices overlooked the\r\ntideless ocean; black caverns yawned; and for ever, among the seaworn\r\nrecesses, murmured and dashed the unfruitful waters. Now my way was\r\nalmost barred by an abrupt promontory, now rendered nearly impracticable\r\nby fragments fallen from the cliff. Evening was at hand, when, seaward,\r\narose, as if on the waving of a wizard\u2019s wand, a murky web of clouds,\r\nblotting the late azure sky, and darkening and disturbing the till now\r\nplacid deep. The clouds had strange, fantastic shapes, and they changed\r\nand mingled and seemed to be driven about by a mighty spell. The waves\r\nraised their white crests; the thunder first muttered, then roared from\r\nacross the waste of waters, which took a deep purple dye, flecked with\r\nfoam. The spot where I stood looked, on one side, to the widespread\r\nocean; on the other, it was barred by a rugged promontory. Round this\r\ncape suddenly came, driven by the wind, a vessel. In vain the mariners\r\ntried to force a path for her to the open sea\u2014the gale drove her on the\r\nrocks. It will perish!\u2014all on board will perish! Would I were among\r\nthem! And to my young heart the idea of death came for the first time\r\nblended with that of joy. It was an awful sight to behold that vessel\r\nstruggling with her fate. Hardly could I discern the sailors, but I\r\nheard them. It was soon all over! A rock, just covered by the tossing\r\nwaves, and so unperceived, lay in wait for its prey. A crash of thunder\r\nbroke over my head at the moment that, with a frightful shock, the\r\nvessel dashed upon her unseen enemy. In a brief space of time she went\r\nto pieces. There I stood in safety; and there were my fellow-creatures\r\nbattling, how hopelessly, with annihilation. Methought I saw them\r\nstruggling\u2014too truly did I hear their shrieks, conquering the barking\r\nsurges in their shrill agony. The dark breakers threw hither and thither\r\nthe fragments of the wreck: soon it disappeared. I had been fascinated\r\nto gaze till the end: at last I sank on my knees\u2014I covered my face with\r\nmy hands. I again looked up; something was floating on the billows\r\ntowards the shore. It neared and neared. Was that a human form? It grew\r\nmore and more distinct; and at last a mighty wave, lifting the whole\r\nfreight, lodged it upon a rock. A human being bestriding a sea-chest!\u2014a\r\nhuman being! Yet was it one? Surely never such had existed before\u2014a\r\nmisshapen dwarf, with squinting eyes, distorted features, and body\r\ndeformed, till it became a horror to behold. My blood, lately warming\r\ntowards a fellow-being so snatched from a watery tomb, froze in my\r\nheart. The dwarf got off his chest; he tossed his straight, struggling\r\nhair from his odious visage.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy St. Beelzebub!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cI have been well bested.\u201d He looked\r\nround and saw me. \u201cOh, by the fiend! here is another ally of the mighty\r\nOne. To what saint did you offer prayers, friend\u2014if not to mine? Yet I\r\nremember you not on board.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shrank from the monster and his blasphemy. Again he questioned me, and\r\nI muttered some inaudible reply. He continued:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYour voice is drowned by this dissonant roar. What a noise the big\r\nocean makes! Schoolboys bursting from their prison are not louder than\r\nthese waves set free to play. They disturb me. I will no more of their\r\nill-timed brawling. Silence, hoary One!\u2014Winds, avaunt!\u2014to your\r\nhomes!\u2014Clouds, fly to the antipodes, and leave our heaven clear!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he stretched out his two long, lank arms, that looked like\r\nspider\u2019s claws, and seemed to embrace with them the expanse before him.\r\nWas it a miracle? The clouds became broken and fled; the azure sky first\r\npeeped out, and then was spread a calm field of blue above us; the\r\nstormy gale was exchanged to the softly breathing west; the sea grew\r\ncalm; the waves dwindled to riplets.\r\n\r\n\u201cI like obedience even in these stupid elements,\u201d said the dwarf. \u201cHow\r\nmuch more in the tameless mind of man! It was a well-got-up storm, you\r\nmust allow\u2014and all of my own making.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was tempting Providence to interchange talk with this magician. But\r\n_Power_, in all its shapes, is respected by man. Awe, curiosity, a\r\nclinging fascination, drew me towards him.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, don\u2019t be frightened, friend,\u201d said the wretch: \u201cI am\r\ngood-humoured when pleased; and something does please me in your\r\nwell-proportioned body and handsome face, though you look a little\r\nwoe-begone. You have suffered a land\u2014I, a sea wreck. Perhaps I can allay\r\nthe tempest of your fortunes as I did my own. Shall we be friends?\u201d\u2014And\r\nhe held out his hand; I could not touch it. \u201cWell, then, companions\u2014that\r\nwill do as well. And now, while I rest after the buffeting I underwent\r\njust now, tell me why, young and gallant as you seem, you wander thus\r\nalone and downcast on this wild sea-shore.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe voice of the wretch was screeching and horrid, and his contortions\r\nas he spoke were frightful to behold. Yet he did gain a kind of\r\ninfluence over me, which I could not master, and I told him my tale.\r\nWhen it was ended, he laughed long and loud: the rocks echoed back the\r\nsound: hell seemed yelling around me.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, thou cousin of Lucifer!\u201d said he; \u201cso thou too hast fallen through\r\nthy pride; and, though bright as the son of Morning, thou art ready to\r\ngive up thy good looks, thy bride, and thy well-being, rather than\r\nsubmit thee to the tyranny of good. I honour thy choice, by my soul!\u2014So\r\nthou hast fled, and yield the day; and mean to starve on these rocks,\r\nand to let the birds peck out thy dead eyes, while thy enemy and thy\r\nbetrothed rejoice in thy ruin. Thy pride is strangely akin to humility,\r\nmethinks.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, a thousand fanged thoughts stung me to the heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat would you that I should do?\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cI!\u2014Oh, nothing, but lie down and say your prayers before you die. But,\r\nwere I you, I know the deed that should be done.\u201d\r\n\r\nI drew near him. His supernatural powers made him an oracle in my eyes;\r\nyet a strange unearthly thrill quivered through my frame as I said,\r\n\u201cSpeak!\u2014teach me\u2014what act do you advise?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRevenge thyself, man!\u2014humble thy enemies!\u2014set thy foot on the old man\u2019s\r\nneck, and possess thyself of his daughter!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the east and west I turn,\u201d cried I, \u201cand see no means! Had I gold,\r\nmuch could I achieve; but, poor and single, I am powerless.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dwarf had been seated on his chest as he listened to my story. Now\r\nhe got off; he touched a spring; it flew open! What a mine of wealth\u2014of\r\nblazing jewels, beaming gold, and pale silver\u2014was displayed therein. A\r\nmad desire to possess this treasure was born within me.\r\n\r\n\u201cDoubtless,\u201d I said, \u201cone so powerful as you could do all things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay,\u201d said the monster humbly, \u201cI am less omnipotent than I seem. Some\r\nthings I possess which you may covet; but I would give them all for a\r\nsmall share, or even for a loan of what is yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy possessions are at your service,\u201d I replied bitterly\u2014\u201cmy poverty, my\r\nexile, my disgrace\u2014I make a free gift of them all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood! I thank you. Add one other thing to your gift, and my treasure is\r\nyours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs nothing is my sole inheritance, what besides nothing would you\r\nhave?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour comely face and well-made limbs.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shivered. Would this all-powerful monster murder me? I had no dagger.\r\nI forgot to pray\u2014but I grew pale.\r\n\r\n\u201cI ask for a loan, not a gift,\u201d said the frightful thing: \u201clend me your\r\nbody for three days\u2014you shall have mine to cage your soul the while,\r\nand, in payment, my chest. What say you to the bargain?\u2014Three short\r\ndays.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe are told that it is dangerous to hold unlawful talk; and well do I\r\nprove the same. Tamely written down, it may seem incredible that I\r\nshould lend any ear to this proposition; but, in spite of his unnatural\r\nugliness, there was something fascinating in a being whose voice could\r\ngovern earth, air, and sea. I felt a keen desire to comply; for with\r\nthat chest I could command the worlds. My only hesitation resulted from\r\na fear that he would not be true to his bargain. Then, I thought, I\r\nshall soon die here on these lonely sands, and the limbs he covets will\r\nbe mine no more:\u2014it is worth the chance. And, besides, I knew that, by\r\nall the rules of art-magic, there were formula and oaths which none of\r\nits practisers dared break. I hesitated to reply; and he went on, now\r\ndisplaying his wealth, now speaking of the petty price he demanded, till\r\nit seemed madness to refuse. Thus is it;\u2014place our bark in the current\r\nof the stream, and down, over fall and cataract it is hurried; give up\r\nour conduct to the wild torrent of passion, and we are away, we know not\r\nwhither.\r\n\r\nHe swore many an oath, and I adjured him by many a sacred name; till I\r\nsaw this wonder of power, this ruler of the elements, shiver like an\r\nautumn leaf before my words; and as if the spirit spake unwillingly and\r\nperforce within him, at last, he, with broken voice, revealed the spell\r\nwhereby he might be obliged, did he wish to play me false, to render up\r\nthe unlawful spoil. Our warm life-blood must mingle to make and to mar\r\nthe charm.\r\n\r\nEnough of this unholy theme. I was persuaded\u2014the thing was done. The\r\nmorrow dawned upon me as I lay upon the shingles, and I knew not my own\r\nshadow as it fell from me. I felt myself changed to a shape of horror,\r\nand cursed my easy faith and blind credulity. The chest was there\u2014there\r\nthe gold and precious stones for which I had sold the frame of flesh\r\nwhich nature had given me. The sight a little stilled my emotions: three\r\ndays would soon be gone.\r\n\r\nThey did pass. The dwarf had supplied me with a plenteous store of food.\r\nAt first I could hardly walk, so strange and out of joint were all my\r\nlimbs; and my voice\u2014it was that of the fiend. But I kept silent, and\r\nturned my face to the sun, that I might not see my shadow, and counted\r\nthe hours, and ruminated on my future conduct. To bring Torella to my\r\nfeet\u2014to possess my Juliet in spite of him\u2014all this my wealth could\r\neasily achieve. During dark night I slept, and dreamt of the\r\naccomplishment of my desires. Two suns had set\u2014the third dawned. I was\r\nagitated, fearful. Oh expectation, what a frightful thing art thou, when\r\nkindled more by fear than hope! How dost thou twist thyself round the\r\nheart, torturing its pulsations! How dost thou dart unknown pangs all\r\nthrough our feeble mechanism, now seeming to shiver us like broken\r\nglass, to nothingness\u2014now giving us a fresh strength, which can _do_\r\nnothing, and so torments us by a sensation, such as the strong man must\r\nfeel who cannot break his fetters, though they bend in his grasp. Slowly\r\npaced the bright, bright orb up the eastern sky; long it lingered in the\r\nzenith, and still more slowly wandered down the west: it touched the\r\nhorizon\u2019s verge\u2014it was lost! Its glories were on the summits of the\r\ncliff\u2014they grew dun and grey. The evening star shone bright. He will\r\nsoon be here.\r\n\r\nHe came not!\u2014By the living heavens, he came not!\u2014and night dragged out\r\nits weary length, and, in its decaying age, \u201cday began to grizzle its\r\ndark hair;\u201d and the sun rose again on the most miserable wretch that\r\never upbraided its light. Three days thus I passed. The jewels and the\r\ngold\u2014oh, how I abhorred them!\r\n\r\nWell, well\u2014I will not blacken these pages with demoniac ravings. All too\r\nterrible were the thoughts, the raging tumult of ideas that filled my\r\nsoul. At the end of that time I slept; I had not before since the third\r\nsunset; and I dreamt that I was at Juliet\u2019s feet, and she smiled, and\r\nthen she shrieked\u2014for she saw my transformation\u2014and again she smiled,\r\nfor still her beautiful lover knelt before her. But it was not I\u2014it was\r\nhe, the fiend, arrayed in my limbs, speaking with my voice, winning her\r\nwith my looks of love. I strove to warn her, but my tongue refused its\r\noffice; I strove to tear him from her, but I was rooted to the ground\u2014I\r\nawoke with the agony. There were the solitary hoar precipices\u2014there the\r\nplashing sea, the quiet strand, and the blue sky over all. What did it\r\nmean? was my dream but a mirror of the truth? was he wooing and winning\r\nmy betrothed? I would on the instant back to Genoa\u2014but I was banished. I\r\nlaughed\u2014the dwarf\u2019s yell burst from my lips\u2014_I_ banished! Oh no! they\r\nhad not exiled the foul limbs I wore; I might with these enter, without\r\nfear of incurring the threatened penalty of death, my own, my native\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nI began to walk towards Genoa. I was somewhat accustomed to my distorted\r\nlimbs; none were ever so ill-adapted for a straightforward movement; it\r\nwas with infinite difficulty that I proceeded. Then, too, I desired to\r\navoid all the hamlets strewed here and there on the sea-beach, for I was\r\nunwilling to make a display of my hideousness. I was not quite sure\r\nthat, if seen, the mere boys would not stone me to death as I passed,\r\nfor a monster; some ungentle salutations I did receive from the few\r\npeasants or fishermen I chanced to meet. But it was dark night before I\r\napproached Genoa. The weather was so balmy and sweet that it struck me\r\nthat the Marchese and his daughter would very probably have quitted the\r\ncity for their country retreat. It was from Villa Torella that I had\r\nattempted to carry off Juliet; I had spent many an hour reconnoitring\r\nthe spot, and knew each inch of ground in its vicinity. It was\r\nbeautifully situated, embosomed in trees, on the margin of a stream. As\r\nI drew near, it became evident that my conjecture was right; nay,\r\nmoreover, that the hours were being then devoted to feasting and\r\nmerriment. For the house was lighted up; strains of soft and gay music\r\nwere wafted towards me by the breeze. My heart sank within me. Such was\r\nthe generous kindness of Torella\u2019s heart that I felt sure that he would\r\nnot have indulged in public manifestations of rejoicing just after my\r\nunfortunate banishment, but for a cause I dared not dwell upon.\r\n\r\nThe country people were all alive and flocking about; it became\r\nnecessary that I should conceal myself; and yet I longed to address some\r\none, or to hear others discourse, or in any way to gain intelligence of\r\nwhat was really going on. At length, entering the walks that were in\r\nimmediate vicinity to the mansion, I found one dark enough to veil my\r\nexcessive frightfulness; and yet others as well as I were loitering in\r\nits shade. I soon gathered all I wanted to know\u2014all that first made my\r\nvery heart die with horror, and then boil with indignation. To-morrow\r\nJuliet was to be given to the penitent, reformed, beloved\r\nGuido\u2014to-morrow my bride was to pledge her vows to a fiend from hell!\r\nAnd I did this!\u2014my accursed pride\u2014my demoniac violence and wicked\r\nself-idolatry had caused this act. For if I had acted as the wretch who\r\nhad stolen my form had acted\u2014if, with a mien at once yielding and\r\ndignified, I had presented myself to Torella, saying, I have done wrong,\r\nforgive me; I am unworthy of your angel-child, but permit me to claim\r\nher hereafter, when my altered conduct shall manifest that I abjure my\r\nvices, and endeavour to become in some sort worthy of her. I go to serve\r\nagainst the infidels; and when my zeal for religion and my true\r\npenitence for the past shall appear to you to cancel my crimes, permit\r\nme again to call myself your son. Thus had he spoken; and the penitent\r\nwas welcomed even as the prodigal son of Scripture: the fatted calf was\r\nkilled for him; and he, still pursuing the same path, displayed such\r\nopen-hearted regret for his follies, so humble a concession of all his\r\nrights, and so ardent a resolve to reacquire them by a life of\r\ncontrition and virtue, that he quickly conquered the kind old man; and\r\nfull pardon, and the gift of his lovely child, followed in swift\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nOh, had an angel from Paradise whispered to me to act thus! But now,\r\nwhat would be the innocent Juliet\u2019s fate? Would God permit the foul\r\nunion\u2014or, some prodigy destroying it, link the dishonoured name of\r\nCarega with the worst of crimes? To-morrow at dawn they were to be\r\nmarried: there was but one way to prevent this\u2014to meet mine enemy, and\r\nto enforce the ratification of our agreement. I felt that this could\r\nonly be done by a mortal struggle. I had no sword\u2014if indeed my distorted\r\narms could wield a soldier\u2019s weapon\u2014but I had a dagger, and in that lay\r\nmy hope. There was no time for pondering or balancing nicely the\r\nquestion: I might die in the attempt; but besides the burning jealousy\r\nand despair of my own heart, honour, mere humanity, demanded that I\r\nshould fall rather than not destroy the machinations of the fiend.\r\n\r\nThe guests departed\u2014the lights began to disappear; it was evident that\r\nthe inhabitants of the villa were seeking repose. I hid myself among the\r\ntrees\u2014the garden grew desert\u2014the gates were closed\u2014I wandered round and\r\ncame under a window\u2014ah! well did I know the same!\u2014a soft twilight\r\nglimmered in the room\u2014the curtains were half withdrawn. It was the\r\ntemple of innocence and beauty. Its magnificence was tempered, as it\r\nwere, by the slight disarrangements occasioned by its being dwelt in,\r\nand all the objects scattered around displayed the taste of her who\r\nhallowed it by her presence. I saw her enter with a quick light step\u2014I\r\nsaw her approach the window\u2014she drew back the curtain yet further, and\r\nlooked out into the night. Its breezy freshness played among her\r\nringlets, and wafted them from the transparent marble of her brow. She\r\nclasped her hands, she raised her eyes to heaven. I heard her voice.\r\nGuido! she softly murmured\u2014mine own Guido! and then, as if overcome by\r\nthe fulness of her own heart, she sank on her knees;\u2014her upraised\r\neyes\u2014her graceful attitude\u2014the beaming thankfulness that lighted up her\r\nface\u2014oh, these are tame words! Heart of mine, thou imagest ever, though\r\nthou canst not portray, the celestial beauty of that child of light and\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nI heard a step\u2014a quick firm step along the shady avenue. Soon I saw a\r\ncavalier, richly dressed, young and, methought, graceful to look on,\r\nadvance. I hid myself yet closer. The youth approached; he paused\r\nbeneath the window. She arose, and again looking out she saw him, and\r\nsaid\u2014I cannot, no, at this distant time I cannot record her terms of\r\nsoft silver tenderness; to me they were spoken, but they were replied to\r\nby him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will not go,\u201d he cried: \u201chere where you have been, where your memory\r\nglides like some heaven-visiting ghost, I will pass the long hours till\r\nwe meet, never, my Juliet, again, day or night, to part. But do thou, my\r\nlove, retire; the cold morn and fitful breeze will make thy cheek pale,\r\nand fill with languor thy love-lighted eyes. Ah, sweetest! could I press\r\none kiss upon them, I could, methinks, repose.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd then he approached still nearer, and methought he was about to\r\nclamber into her chamber. I had hesitated, not to terrify her; now I was\r\nno longer master of myself. I rushed forward\u2014I threw myself on him\u2014I\r\ntore him away\u2014I cried, \u201cO loathsome and foul-shaped wretch!\u201d\r\n\r\nI need not repeat epithets, all tending, as it appeared, to rail at a\r\nperson I at present feel some partiality for. A shriek rose from\r\nJuliet\u2019s lips. I neither heard nor saw\u2014I _felt_ only mine enemy, whose\r\nthroat I grasped, and my dagger\u2019s hilt; he struggled, but could not\r\nescape. At length hoarsely he breathed these words: \u201cDo!\u2014strike home!\r\ndestroy this body\u2014you will still live: may your life be long and merry!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe descending dagger was arrested at the word, and he, feeling my hold\r\nrelax, extricated himself and drew his sword, while the uproar in the\r\nhouse, and flying of torches from one room to the other, showed that\r\nsoon we should be separated. In the midst of my frenzy there was much\r\ncalculation:\u2014fall I might, and so that he did not survive, I cared not\r\nfor the death-blow I might deal against myself. While still, therefore,\r\nhe thought I paused, and while I saw the villanous resolve to take\r\nadvantage of my hesitation, in the sudden thrust he made at me, I threw\r\nmyself on his sword, and at the same moment plunged my dagger, with a\r\ntrue, desperate aim, in his side. We fell together, rolling over each\r\nother, and the tide of blood that flowed from the gaping wound of each\r\nmingled on the grass. More I know not\u2014I fainted.\r\n\r\nAgain I return to life: weak almost to death, I found myself stretched\r\nupon a bed\u2014Juliet was kneeling beside it. Strange! my first broken\r\nrequest was for a mirror. I was so wan and ghastly, that my poor girl\r\nhesitated, as she told me afterwards; but, by the mass! I thought myself\r\na right proper youth when I saw the dear reflection of my own well-known\r\nfeatures. I confess it is a weakness, but I avow it, I do entertain a\r\nconsiderable affection for the countenance and limbs I behold, whenever\r\nI look at a glass; and have more mirrors in my house, and consult them\r\noftener, than any beauty in Genoa. Before you too much condemn me,\r\npermit me to say that no one better knows than I the value of his own\r\nbody; no one, probably, except myself, ever having had it stolen from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIncoherently I at first talked of the dwarf and his crimes, and\r\nreproached Juliet for her too easy admission of his love. She thought me\r\nraving, as well she might; and yet it was some time before I could\r\nprevail on myself to admit that the Guido whose penitence had won her\r\nback for me was myself; and while I cursed bitterly the monstrous dwarf,\r\nand blest the well-directed blow that had deprived him of life, I\r\nsuddenly checked myself when I heard her say, Amen! knowing that him\r\nwhom she reviled was my very self. A little reflection taught me\r\nsilence\u2014a little practice enabled me to speak of that frightful night\r\nwithout any very excessive blunder. The wound I had given myself was no\r\nmockery of one\u2014it was long before I recovered\u2014and as the benevolent and\r\ngenerous Torella sat beside me, talking such wisdom as might win friends\r\nto repentance, and mine own dear Juliet hovered near me, administering\r\nto my wants, and cheering me by her smiles, the work of my bodily cure\r\nand mental reform went on together. I have never, indeed, wholly\r\nrecovered my strength\u2014my cheek is paler since\u2014my person a little bent.\r\nJuliet sometimes ventures to allude bitterly to the malice that caused\r\nthis change, but I kiss her on the moment, and tell her all is for the\r\nbest. I am a fonder and more faithful husband, and true is this\u2014but for\r\nthat wound, never had I called her mine.\r\n\r\nI did not revisit the sea-shore, nor seek for the fiend\u2019s treasure; yet,\r\nwhile I ponder on the past, I often think, and my confessor was not\r\nbackward in favouring the idea, that it might be a good rather than an\r\nevil spirit, sent by my guardian angel, to show me the folly and misery\r\nof pride. So well at least did I learn this lesson, roughly taught as I\r\nwas, that I am known now by all my friends and fellow-citizens by the\r\nname of Guido il Cortese.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   X.\r\n\r\n                          _THE SWISS PEASANT._\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY is the mind of man so apt to be swayed by contraries? why does the\r\nimagination for ever paint the impossible in glittering tints, and the\r\nhearts of wayward mortals cling, with the greatest tenacity, to what,\r\neel-like, is bent on escaping from their grasp? Why\u2014to bring the matter\r\nhome\u2014is solitude abhorrent to me, now that I enjoy it in perfection? I\r\nhave apostrophized the coy nymph in ball-rooms, when the bright lamps of\r\nheaven were shamed by brighter earth-stars, and lamented her absence at\r\na picnic party, where the nightingale was silenced by the fiddle.\r\n\r\nAnd now, O solitude! I abjure thee, in thy fitting temple\u2014in\r\nSwitzerland\u2014among cloud-piercing mountains, by the resounding waves of\r\nthe isle-surrounding lake. I am beside the waters of Uri\u2014where Tell\r\nlived\u2014in Brunen, where the Swiss patriots swore to die for freedom. It\r\nrains\u2014magic word to destroy the spell to which these words give rise\u2014the\r\nclouds envelop the hills\u2014the white mists veil the ravines\u2014there is a\r\nroar and a splash in my ears\u2014and now and then the vapours break and\r\nscatter themselves, and I see something dark between, which is the hoar\r\nside of a dark precipice, but which might as well be the turf stack or\r\nold wall that bounded Cumberland\u2019s view as he wrote the _Wheel of\r\nFortune_.\r\n\r\nThe sole book that I possess is the _Prisoner of Chillon_. I have read\r\nit through three times within an hour. Its noble author composed it to\r\nbeguile weary hours like these when he remained rain-bound for three\r\ndays in a little inn on the shores of the Lake of Geneva; and cannot I,\r\nfollowing with unequal steps, so cheat the minutes in this dim spot? I\r\nnever, by the by, could invent the commonest incident. As a man of\r\nhonour, of course I never lie; but, as a nursery child and schoolboy, I\r\nnever did; simply, as I remember, because I never could concoct one;\u2014but\r\na true tale was lately narrated to me by its very heroine, the incidents\r\nof which haunt my memory, adorned as they were by her animated looks and\r\nsoft silvery accent. Let me try to record them, stripped though they\r\nmust be of their greatest charm.\r\n\r\nI was, but a week ago, travelling with my friend Ashburn in a coup\u00e9e, in\r\nthe district of Subiaco, in the ecclesiastical territory. We were jolted\r\nalong a rough ravine, through which the river Anio sped, and beetling\r\nmountains and shady trees, a distant convent and a picturesque cell on a\r\nhill, formed a view which so awoke the pictorial propensities of my\r\nfriend, that he stopped the coup\u00e9e (though we were assured that we\r\nshould never reach our inn by nightfall, and that the road was dangerous\r\nin the dark), took out his portfolio, and began to sketch. As he drew, I\r\ncontinued to speak in support of an argument we had entered upon before.\r\nI had been complaining of the commonplace and ennui of life. Ashburn\r\ninsisted that our existence was only too full of variety and\r\nchange\u2014tragic variety and wondrous incredible change. \u201cEven,\u201d said the\r\npainter, \u201cas sky, and earth, and water seem for ever the same to the\r\nvulgar eye, and yet to the gifted one assume a thousand various guises\r\nand hues\u2014now robed in purple\u2014now shrouded in black\u2014now resplendent with\r\nliving gold\u2014and anon sinking into sober and unobtrusive grey, so do our\r\nmortal lives change and vary. No living being among us but could tell a\r\ntale of soul-subduing joys and heart-consuming woes, worthy, had they\r\ntheir poet, of the imagination of Shakespeare or Goethe. The veriest\r\nweather-worn cabin is a study for colouring, and the meanest peasant\r\nwill offer all the acts of a drama in the apparently dull routine of his\r\nhumble life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is pure romance,\u201d I replied; \u201cput it to the test. Let us take, for\r\nexample, yonder woman descending the mountain-path.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a figure!\u201d cried Ashburn; \u201coh that she would stay thus but one\r\nquarter of an hour!\u2014she has come down to bathe her child\u2014her upturned\r\nface\u2014her dark hair\u2014her picturesque costume\u2014the little plump fellow\r\nbestriding her\u2014the rude scenery around\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the romantic tale she has to tell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would wager a louis that hers has been no common fate. She steps a\r\ngoddess\u2014her attitude, her looks, are all filled with majesty.\u201d\r\n\r\nI laughed at his enthusiasm, and accepted his bet. We hurried to join\r\nour fair peasantess, and thus formed acquaintance with Fanny Chaumont. A\r\nsudden storm, as we were engaged conversing with her, came, driven down\r\nfrom the tempest-bearing hills, and she gave us a cordial invitation to\r\nher cottage.\r\n\r\nIt was situated on a sunny, yet sheltered slope. There was a look of\r\ncheerfulness and _aisance_ about it, beyond what is usually met in that\r\npart of Switzerland, reminding me of the cottages of the inhabitants of\r\nthe free States. There, also, we found her husband. I always feel\r\ncurious to know on whom a woman, who bears the stamp of superior\r\nintellect, who is beautiful and refined\u2014for peasant as she was, Fanny\r\nwas both\u2014has been induced to bestow herself.\r\n\r\nLouis Chaumont was considerably older than his wife; he was handsome,\r\nwith brown lively eyes, curly chestnut hair, a visage embrowned by the\r\nsun, bearing every mark of having led an active, even an adventurous\r\nlife; there was, besides, an expression which, if it were not ferocity,\r\nresembled it, in his vivacious glances, and in the sternness of his\r\ndeeply-lined forehead; while she, in spite of her finely-formed brow,\r\nher majestic person, and her large expressive eyes, looked softness and\r\npatience itself. There was something incongruous in the pair, and more\r\nstrangely matched they seemed when we heard their story. It lost me my\r\nlouis, but proved Fanny at once to be a fitting heroine for romance, and\r\nwas a lesson, moreover, to teach the strange pranks love can play with\r\nus, mingling fire and water, blending in one harmonious concord the\r\nharsh base and melodious tenor of two differently stringed instruments.\r\nThough their child was five years old, Fanny and her husband were\r\nattached to each other with the tenderness and passion of early love;\r\nthey were happy\u2014his faults were tempered by her angel disposition, and\r\nher too melancholy and feeling-fraught spirit was enlivened and made\r\nplastic to the purposes of this world by his energy and activity.\r\n\r\nFanny was a Bernese by birth: she was the child of humble cottagers, one\r\namong a large family. They lived on the brow of one summit and at the\r\nfoot of another. The snowy mountains were piled about them; thaw-fed\r\ntorrents brawled around; during the night a sound like thunder, a crash\r\namong the tempest-beaten pines would tell of an avalanche; or the\r\nsnowdrift, whirring past the lattice, threatened to bury the little\r\nfabric. Winter was the season of peace in the deep vales, not so in the\r\nhigher district. The peasant was often kept waking by the soft-falling\r\nsnow which threatened insidiously to encroach on, and to overwhelm his\r\nhabitation; or a straying cow would lead him far into the depths of the\r\nstormy hills, and his fearful family would count in agony the hours of\r\nhis absence. Perpetual hardship and danger, however, rather brutify than\r\nexalt the soul of man; and those of the Swiss who are most deeply\r\nplanted among the rocky wilds are often stultified and sullen.\r\n\r\nFanny opened her youthful eyes and observation on this scene. She was\r\none of those lovely children whose beauty is heartfelt but\r\nindescribable: hers was the smooth candid brow, the large hazel eyes,\r\nhalf soft, half wild; the round dimpled cheek, the full sensitive mouth,\r\nthe pointed chin, and (as framework to the picture) the luxuriant curly\r\nchestnut hair, and voice which is sweetest music. The exceeding beauty\r\nof little Fanny gained her the observation of the wife of the owner of\r\nthe chateau which overlooked and commanded the district, and at ten\r\nyears of age she became a frequent visitor there. Fanny\u2019s little soul\r\nwas love, so she soon twined herself round the kind lady\u2019s heart, became\r\na pet with her husband, and the favourite playmate of their only son.\r\n\r\nOne f\u00eate day Fanny had dined at the chateau. It had been fine warm\r\nspring weather, but wind and storm came on with the setting sun; the\r\nsnow began to fall thickly, and it was decided that Fanny must pass the\r\nnight in the chateau. She had been unusually eager to return home; and\r\nwhen the tempest came on, she crept near her protectress, and begged to\r\nbe sent to her mother. _C\u2019est impossible_\u2014Fanny pressed no further, but\r\nshe clambered to a window, and looked out wistfully to where, hidden by\r\nthe hills, her parents\u2019 cottage stood. It was a fatal night for her: the\r\nthunders of frequent avalanches, the roaring of torrents, the crash of\r\ntrees, spoke of devastation, and her home was its chief prey. Father,\r\nmother, brothers, and sisters, not one survived. Where, the day before,\r\ncottage and outhouse and flower garden had stood, the little lawn where\r\nshe played, and the grove that sheltered her, there was now a monumental\r\npile of snow, and the rocky path of a torrent; no trace remained, not\r\none survivor to tell the tale. From that night Fanny became a constant\r\ninmate of the chateau.\r\n\r\nIt was Madame de Marville\u2019s project to give her a bourgeois education,\r\nwhich would raise her from the hardships of a peasant\u2019s life, and yet\r\nnot elevate her above her natural position in society. She was brought\r\nup kindly, but humbly; it was the virtues of her disposition which\r\nraised her in the eyes of all around her\u2014not any ill-judged favour of\r\nher benefactress. The night of the destruction of her family never\r\npassed away from her memory; it set a seal of untimely seriousness on\r\nher childish brow, awoke deep thoughts in her infant heart, and a strong\r\nresolve that while she lived, her beloved friends should find her, as\r\nfar as her humble powers admitted, a source of good alone\u2014a reason to\r\nrejoice that they had saved her from the destruction that had\r\noverwhelmed her family.\r\n\r\nThus Fanny grew up in beauty and in virtue. Her smiles were as the\r\nrainbows of her native torrents: her voice, her caresses, her light\r\nstep, her unalterable sweetness and ceaseless devotion to the wishes of\r\nothers, made her the idol of the family. Henry, the only child of her\r\nprotectors, was of her own age, or but a few months her senior. Every\r\ntime Henry returned from school to visit his parents, he found Fanny\r\nmore beautiful, more kind, more attractive than before; and the first\r\npassion his youthful heart knew was for the lovely peasant girl, whose\r\nvirtues sanctified his home. A look, a gesture betrayed his secret to\r\nhis mother; she turned a hasty glance on Fanny, and saw on her\r\ncountenance innocence and confidence alone. Half reassured, yet still\r\nfearful, Madame de Marville began to reflect on some cure for the\r\nthreatened evil. She could not bear to send away Fanny; she was\r\nsolicitous that her son should for the present reside in his home. The\r\nlovely girl was perfectly unconscious of the sentiments of the young\r\nseigneur; but would she always continue so? and was the burning heart\r\nthat warmed her gentle bosom to be for ever insensible to the despotic\r\nand absorbing emotions of love?\r\n\r\nIt was with wonder, and a curious mixture of disappointed maternal pride\r\nand real gladness, that the lady at length discovered a passion dawning\r\nin fair Fanny\u2019s heart for Louis Chaumont, a peasant some ten years older\r\nthan herself. It was natural that one with such high-wrought feelings as\r\nour heroine should love one to whom she could look up, and on whom to\r\ndepend, rather than her childhood\u2019s playmate\u2014the gay, thoughtless Henry.\r\nLouis\u2019s family had been the victim of a moral ruin, as hers of a\r\nphysical one. They had been oppressed, reduced to poverty, driven from\r\ntheir homes by a feudal tyrant, and had come poor and forlorn from a\r\ndistant district. His mother, accustomed to a bourgeois\u2019 life, died\r\nbroken-hearted: his father, a man of violent passions, nourished in his\r\nown and in his son\u2019s heart, sentiments of hatred and revenge against the\r\n\u201cproud oppressors of the land.\u201d They were obliged to labour hard, yet in\r\nthe intervals of work, father and son would read or discourse concerning\r\nthe ills attendant on humanity, and they traced all to the social\r\nsystem, which made the few the tyrants of the many.\r\n\r\nLouis was handsome, bold, and active; he excelled his compeers in every\r\nhardy exercise; his resolution, his daring, made him, in spite of his\r\npoverty, a kind of leader among them. He had many faults; he was too\r\nfull of passion, of the spirit of resistance and revenge; but his heart\r\nwas kind; his understanding, when not thwarted, strong; and the very\r\ndepth of his feelings made him keenly susceptible to love. Fanny, in her\r\nsimple but majestic beauty, in her soft kindness of manner, mingled with\r\nthe profoundest sensibility, made a deep impression on the young man\u2019s\r\nheart. His converse, so different and so superior to those of his\r\nfellows, won her attention.\r\n\r\nHitherto Fanny had never given utterance to the secrets of her soul.\r\nHabitual respect held her silent with Madame, and Henry, as spirited and\r\nas heedless as a chamois, could ill understand her; but Louis became the\r\ndepository of the many feelings which, piled up in secrecy and silence,\r\nwere half awful to herself; he brought reason, or what he deemed such,\r\nto direct her heart-born conclusions. To have heard them talk of life\r\nand death, and all its shows, you would have wondered by what freak\r\nphilosophy had dressed herself in youth and a peasant\u2019s garb, and\r\nwandered from the schools to these untaught wilds.\r\n\r\nMadame de Marville saw and encouraged this attachment. Louis was not\r\nexactly the person she would have selected for Fanny; but he was the\r\nonly being for whom she had ever evinced a predilection; and, besides,\r\nthe danger of a misalliance which threatened her own son, rendered her\r\neager to build an insurmountable wall between him and the object of his\r\naffections. Thus Fanny enjoyed the heart-gladdening pride of hearing her\r\nchoice applauded and praised by the person she most respected and loved\r\nin the world. As yet, however, love had been covert; the soul but not\r\nthe apparent body of their intercourse. Louis was kept in awe by this\r\nhigh-minded girl, and Fanny had not yet learned her own secret. It was\r\nHenry who made the discovery for them;\u2014Henry, who, with all the\r\nimpetuosity of his vivacious character, contrived a thousand ways to\r\ncome between them, who, stung by jealousy to injustice, reviled Louis\r\nfor his ruin, his poverty, his opinions, and brought the spirit of\r\ndissension to disquiet a mind entirely bent, as she imagined, on holy\r\nand pure thoughts.\r\n\r\nUnder this clash of passion, the action of the drama rapidly developed\r\nitself, and, for nearly a year, a variety of scenes were acted among\r\nthese secluded mountains of no interest save to the parties themselves,\r\nbut to them fateful and engrossing. Louis and Fanny exchanged vows; but\r\nthat sufficed not. Fanny insisted on the right of treating with uniform\r\nkindness the son of her best friend, in spite of his injustice and\r\ninsolence. The young men were often, during the rural festivals, brought\r\ninto angry collision. Fanny was the peacemaker: but a woman is the worst\r\npossible mediator between her rival lovers. Henry was sometimes\r\nirritated to complain to his father of Louis\u2019 presumption. The spirit of\r\nthe French Revolution then awakening, rendered a peasant\u2019s assumptions\r\npeculiarly grating; and it required Madame de Marville\u2019s impartial\r\ngentleness to prevent Fanny\u2019s betrothed, as now he was almost\r\nconsidered, from being further oppressed.\r\n\r\nAt length it was decided that Henry should absent himself for a time,\r\nand visit Paris. He was enraged in the extreme by what he called his\r\nbanishment. Noble and generous as he naturally was, love was the tyrant\r\nof his soul, and drove him almost to crime. He entered into a fierce\r\nquarrel with his rival on the very eve of his departure: it ended in a\r\nscene of violence and bloodshed. No great real harm was done; but\r\nMonsieur de Marville, hitherto scarcely kept back from such a measure by\r\nhis wife, suddenly obtained an order for Louis (his father had died a\r\nyear before) to quit the territory within twelve hours. Fanny was\r\ncommanded, as she valued the favour of her friends, to give him up. The\r\nyoung men were both gone before any intercession could avail; and that\r\nkind of peace which resembles desolation took possession of the chateau.\r\n\r\nAware of the part she had taken in encouraging Fanny\u2019s attachment to her\r\npeasant-lover, Madame de Marville did not make herself a party to the\r\ntyranny of her husband; she requested only of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e to defer any\r\ndecisive step, and not to quit her guardianship until the return of her\r\nson, which was to take place the following year. Fanny consented to such\r\na delay, although in doing so she had to resist the angry\r\nrepresentations of her lover, who exacted that she should quit the roof\r\nof his oppressors. It was galling to his proud spirit that she should\r\ncontinue to receive benefits from them, and injurious to his love that\r\nshe should remain where his rival\u2019s name was the constant theme of\r\ndiscourse and the object of interest. Fanny in vain represented her debt\r\nof gratitude, the absence of Henry, the impossibility that she could\r\nfeel any undue sentiment towards the young seigneur; not to hate him was\r\na crime in Louis\u2019 eyes; yet how, in spite of his ill-conduct, could\r\nFanny hate her childhood\u2019s playmate\u2014her brother? His violent passions\r\nexcited to their utmost height\u2014jealousy and the sense of impotent\r\nindignation raging in his heart\u2014Louis swore to revenge himself on the\r\nMarvilles\u2014to forget and to abhor his mistress!\u2014his last words were a\r\nmalediction on them, and a violent denunciation of scorn upon her.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will all be well yet,\u201d thought Fanny, as she strove to calm the\r\ntumultuous and painful emotions to which his intemperate passion gave\r\nrise. \u201cNot only are storms the birth of the wild elements, but of the\r\nheart of man, and we can oppose patience and fortitude alone to their\r\ndestructive violence. A year will pass\u2014I shall quit the chateau; Louis\r\nwill acknowledge my truth, and retract his frightful words.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe continued, therefore, to fulfil her duties cheerfully, not\r\npermitting her thoughts to dwell on the idea, that, in spite of her\r\nstruggles, too painfully occupied her\u2014the probability that Louis would\r\nin the end renounce or forget her; but committing her cause to the\r\nspirit of good, she trusted that its influence would in the end prevail.\r\n\r\nShe had, however, much to endure; for months passed, and no tidings\r\nreached her of Louis. Often she felt sick at heart; often she became the\r\nprey of the darkest despair; above all, her tender heart missed the fond\r\nattentions of love, the bliss of knowing that she bestowed happiness,\r\nand the unrestrained intercourse to which mutual affection had given\r\nrise. She cherished hope as a duty, and faith in love, rather than in\r\nher unjust and cruelly neglectful lover. It was a hard task, for she had\r\nnowhere to turn for consolation or encouragement. Madame de Marville\r\nmarked with gladness the total separation between them. Now that the\r\ndanger that threatened her son was averted, she relented having been\r\ninfluential in producing an attachment between Fanny and one whom she\r\ndeemed unworthy of her. She redoubled her kindness, and, in the true\r\nContinental fashion, tried to get up a match between her and some one\r\namong her many and more prosperous admirers. She failed, but did not\r\ndespair, till she saw the poor girl\u2019s cheek grow pale and her vivacity\r\ndesert her, as month after month passed away, and the very name of Louis\r\nappeared to be forgotten by all except herself.\r\n\r\nThe stirring and terrible events that took place at this time in France\r\nadded to Fanny\u2019s distress of mind. She had been familiarized to the\r\ndiscussion of the theories, now attempted to be put in practice, by the\r\nconversations of Chaumont. As each fresh account brought information of\r\nthe guilty and sanguinary acts of men whose opinions were the same as\r\nthose of her lover, her fears on his account increased. In a few words I\r\nshall hurry over this part of her story. Switzerland became agitated by\r\nthe same commotions as tore the near kingdom. The peasantry rose in\r\ntumult; acts of violence and blood were committed; at first at a\r\ndistance from her retired valley, but gradually approaching its\r\nprecincts, until at last the tree of liberty was set up in the\r\nneighbouring village. Monsieur de Marville was an aristocrat of the most\r\nbigoted species. In vain was the danger represented to him, and the\r\nunwarlike state of his retinue. He armed them\u2014he hurried down\u2014he came\r\nunawares on the crowd who were proclaiming the triumph of liberty,\r\nrather by feasting than force. On the first attack, they were dispersed,\r\nand one or two among them were wounded; the pole they had gathered round\r\nwas uprooted, the emblematic cap trampled to the earth. The governor\r\nreturned victorious to his chateau.\r\n\r\nThis act of violence on his part seemed the match to fire a train of\r\norganized resistance to his authority, of which none had dreamt before.\r\nStrangers from other cantons thronged into the valley; rustic labours\r\nwere cast aside; popular assemblies were held, and the peasants\r\nexercised in the use of arms. One was coming to place himself at their\r\nhead, it was said, who had been a party in the tumults at Geneva. Louis\r\nChaumont was coming\u2014the champion of liberty, the sworn enemy of M. de\r\nMarville. The influence of his presence soon became manifest. The\r\ninhabitants of the chateau were besieged. If one ventured beyond a\r\ncertain limit he was assailed. It was the resolve of Louis that all\r\nwithin its walls should surrender themselves to his mercy. What that\r\nmight be, the proud curl of his lip and the fire that glanced from his\r\ndark eyes rendered scarcely problematic. Fanny would not believe the\r\nworst of her lover, but Monsieur and Madame de Marville, no longer\r\nrestrained by any delicacy, spoke of the leveller in unmeasured terms of\r\nabhorrence, comparing him to the monsters who then reigned in France,\r\nwhile the danger they incurred through him added a bitter sting to their\r\nwords. The peril grew each day; famine began to make its appearance in\r\nthe chateau; while the intelligence which some of the more friendly\r\npeasants brought was indicative of preparations for a regular attack of\r\nthe most formidable nature. A summons at last came from the insurgents.\r\nThey were resolved to destroy the emblem of their slavery\u2014the feudal\r\nhalls of their tyrants. They declared their intention of firing the\r\nchateau the next day, and called on all within to deliver themselves up,\r\nif they would not be buried in its ruins. They offered their lives and\r\nfree leave to depart to all, save the governor himself, who must place\r\nhimself unconditionally at the mercy of their leader. \u201cThe wretch,\u201d\r\nexclaimed his lady, \u201cwho thirsts for your blood! Fly! if there is yet\r\ntime for flight; we, you see, are safe. Fly! nor suffer these cruel\r\ndastards to boast of having murdered you.\u201d\r\n\r\nM. de Marville yielded to these entreaties and representations. He had\r\nsent for a military force to aid him\u2014it had been denied. He saw that he\r\nhimself, as the detested person, was the cause of danger to his family.\r\nIt was therefore agreed that he should seek a ch\u00e2let situated on a\r\nmountain ten leagues distant, where he might lie concealed till his\r\nfamily joined him. Accordingly, in a base disguise, he quitted at\r\nmidnight the walls he was unable to defend; a miserable night for the\r\nunfortunate beings left behind. The coming day was to witness the\r\ndestruction of their home; and they, beggars in the world, were to\r\nwander through the inhospitable mountains, till, with caution and\r\nterror, they could unobserved reach the remote and miserable ch\u00e2let, and\r\nlearn the fate of the unhappy fugitive. It was a sleepless night for\r\nall. To add to Madame\u2019s agony, she knew that her son\u2019s life was in\r\ndanger in Paris\u2014that he had been denounced\u2014and, though yet untaken, his\r\nescape was still uncertain. From the turret of the castle that, situated\r\nhigh on a rock, commanded the valley below, she sat the livelong night\r\nwatching for every sound\u2014fearful of some shout, some report of firearms,\r\nwhich would announce the capture of her husband. It was September; the\r\nnights were chill; pale and trembling, she saw day break over the hills.\r\nFanny had busied herself during these anxious hours by preparing for\r\ntheir departure; the terrified domestics had already fled; she, the\r\nlady, and the old lame gardener were all that remained. At dawn she\r\nbrought forth the mule, and harnessed him to the rude vehicle which was\r\nto convey them to their place of refuge. Whatever was most valuable in\r\nthe chateau had already been sent away long before, or was secreted; a\r\nfew necessaries alone she provided. And now she ascended the turret\r\nstairs, and stood before her protectress, announcing that all was ready,\r\nand that they must depart. At this last moment, Madame de Marville\r\nappeared deprived of strength; she strove to rise\u2014she sank to the ground\r\nin a fit. Forgetful of her deserted state, Fanny called aloud for help,\r\nand then her heart beat wildly as a quick, youthful step was heard on\r\nthe stairs. Who could he be? would _he_ come to insult their\r\nwretchedness\u2014he, the author of their woe? The first glance changed the\r\nobject of her terror. Henry flew to his mother\u2019s side, and, with broken\r\nexclamations and agitated questions, demanded an explanation of what he\r\nsaw. He had fled for safety to the habitation of his parents\u2014he found it\r\ndeserted; the first voice he heard was that of Fanny crying for help\u2014the\r\nfirst sight that presented itself was his mother, to all appearance\r\ndead, lying on the floor of the turret. Her recovery was followed by\r\nbrief explanations, and a consultation of how his safety was to be\r\nprovided for. The name of Chaumont excited his bitterest execrations.\r\nWith a soldier\u2019s haughty resolve, he was darting from the castle to meet\r\nand to wreak vengeance on his rival. His mother threw herself at his\r\nfeet, clasping his knees, calling wildly on him not to desert her.\r\nFanny\u2019s gentle, sweet voice was of more avail to calm his passion.\r\n\u201cChevalier,\u201d she said, \u201cit is not thus that you must display your\r\ncourage or protect the helpless. To encounter yonder infuriated mob\r\nwould be to run on certain death; you must preserve yourself for your\r\nfamily\u2014you must have pity on your mother, who cannot survive you. Be\r\nguided by me, I beseech you.\u201d\r\n\r\nHenry yielded to her voice, and a more reasonable arrangement took\r\nplace. The departure of Madame de Marville and Fanny was expected at the\r\nvillage, and a pledge had been given that they should proceed\r\nunmolested. But deeply had the insurgents sworn that if the governor or\r\nhis son (whose arrival in the chateau had been suspected) attempted to\r\nescape with them, they should be immediately sacrificed to _justice_. No\r\ndisguise would suffice\u2014the active observation of their enemies was\r\nknown. Every inhabitant of the castle had been numbered\u2014the fate of each\r\nascertained, save that of the two most detested\u2014the governor, whose\r\nflight had not been discovered, and his son, whose arrival was so\r\nunexpected and ill-timed. As still they consulted, a beat to arms was\r\nheard in the valley below: it was the signal that the attack on the\r\nempty castle walls would soon begin. There was no time for delay or\r\nhesitation. Henry placed himself at the bottom of the charrette; straw\r\nand a variety of articles were heaped upon him; the two women ascended\r\nin trepidation; and the old gardener sat in front and held the reins.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the disturbed state of the districts through which\r\nthey were to pass,\u2014where the appearance of one of the upper classes\r\nexcited the fiercest enmity, and frightful insult, if not death, was\r\ntheir sure welcome,\u2014Madame and her friend assumed a peasant\u2019s garb. And\r\nthus they wound their way down the steep; the unhappy lady weeping\r\nbitterly; Fanny, with tearless eyes, but with pale cheek and compressed\r\nlips, gazing for the last time on the abode which had been her refuge\r\nwhen, in helpless infancy, she was left an orphan\u2014where kindness and\r\nbenevolence had waited on her, and where her days had passed in\r\ninnocence and peace. \u201cAnd he drives us away!\u2014him, whom I loved\u2014whom I\r\nlove!\u2014O misery!\u201d\r\n\r\nThey reached the foot of the eminence on which the chateau was placed,\r\nand proceeded along the road which led directly through the village.\r\nWith the approach of danger, vain regrets were exchanged for a lively\r\nsense of fear in the bosom of the hapless mother, and for the exertion\r\nof her courage and forethought in Fanny\u2019s more energetic mind. They\r\npassed a peasant or two, who uttered a malediction or imprecation on\r\nthem as they went; then groups of two or three, who were even more\r\nviolent in gesture and menace; when suddenly the sound of many steps\r\ncame on their ears, and at a turn of the road they met Chaumont with a\r\nband of about twenty disciplined men.\r\n\r\n\u201cFear not,\u201d he said to Madame de Marville; \u201cI will protect you from\r\ndanger till you are beyond the village.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a shriek, the lady, in answer, threw herself in Fanny\u2019s arms.\r\n\r\n\u201cFear not, Madame\u2014he dares not injure you. Begone, Louis! insult us not\r\nby your presence. Begone! I say.\u201d\r\n\r\nFanny spoke angrily. She had not adopted this tone, but that the lady\u2019s\r\nterror, and the knowledge that even then the young soldier crouched at\r\ntheir feet, burnt to spring up and confront his enemy, made her use an\r\nauthority which a woman always imagines that a lover dare not resist.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not insult you,\u201d repeated Chaumont\u2014\u201cI save you. I have no quarrel\r\nwith the lady; tyrants alone need fear me. You are not safe without my\r\nescort. Do not you, false girl, irritate me. I have ensured her escape;\r\nbut yours\u2014you are in my power.\u201d\r\n\r\nA violent movement at the bottom of the charrette called forth all\r\nFanny\u2019s terrors.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake me!\u201d she cried; \u201cdo with me what you please; but you dare not, you\r\ncannot raise a finger against the innocent. Begone, I say! let me never\r\nsee you more!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are obeyed. On you fall the consequences.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus, after many months of separation, did Fanny and her lover meet. She\r\nhad purposed when she should see him to make an appeal to his better\r\nnature\u2014his reason; she had meant to use her all-persuasive voice to\r\nrecall him from the dangerous path he was treading. Several times,\r\nindeed, since his arrival in the valley, she had endeavoured to obtain\r\nan interview with him, but he dreaded her influence: he had resolved on\r\nrevenge, and he feared to be turned back. But now the unexpected\r\npresence of his rival robbed her of her self-possession, and forced her\r\nto change her plans. She saw frightful danger in their meeting, and all\r\nher endeavours were directed to the getting rid of her lover.\r\n\r\nLouis and his companions proceeded towards the chateau, while the\r\ncharrette of the fugitives moved on in the opposite direction. They met\r\nmany a ferocious group, who were rushing forward to aid in the\r\ndestruction of their home; and glad they were, in that awful hour, that\r\nany object had power to divert the minds of their enemies from attention\r\nto themselves. The road they pursued wound through the valley; the\r\nprecipitous mountain on one side, a brawling stream on the other. Now\r\nthey ascended higher and now again descended in their route, while the\r\nroad, broken by the fall of rocks, intersected by torrents, which tore\r\ntheir way athwart it, made their progress slow. To get beyond the\r\nvillage was the aim of their desires; when, lo! just as they came upon\r\nit, and were in the very midst of its population, which was pouring\r\ntowards the castle, suddenly the charrette sank in a deep rut; it half\r\nupset, and every spoke in the wheel giving way rendered the vehicle\r\nwholly useless.\r\n\r\nFanny had indeed already sprung to the ground to examine what hope\r\nremained: there was none. \u201cGrand Dieu! we are lost!\u201d were the first\r\nwords that escaped her, while Madame stood aghast, trembling, almost\r\ninsensible, knowing that the hope of her life, the existence of her son,\r\ndepended on these miserable moments.\r\n\r\nA peasant who owed Fanny some kindness now advanced, and in a kind of\r\ncavalier way, as if to blemish as much as he could the matter of his\r\noffer by its manner, told them, that, for the pleasure of getting rid of\r\nthe aristocrats, he would lend his car\u2014there it was, let them quickly\r\nbestow their lading in it and pursue their way. As he spoke, he caught\r\nup a box, and began the transfer from one car to the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no!\u201d cried Madame de Marville, as, with a scream, she sprang\r\nforward and grasped the arm of the man as he was in the very act of\r\ndiscovering her son\u2019s hiding-place. \u201cWe will accept nothing from our\r\nbase enemies!\u2014Begone with your offers! we will die here, rather than\r\naccept anything from such _canaille_.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe word was electric. The fierce passions of the mob, excited by the\r\nmischief they were about to perpetrate, now burst like a stream into\r\nthis new channel. With violent execrations they rushed upon the\r\nunfortunate woman: they would have torn her from the car, but already\r\nher son had sprung from his hiding-place, and, striking a violent blow\r\nat the foremost assailant, checked for a moment their brutal outrages.\r\nThen again, with a yell, such as the savage Indians alone could emulate,\r\nthey rushed on their prey. Mother and son were torn asunder, and cries\r\nof \u201cA bas les aristocrats!\u201d\u2014\u201cA la lanterne!\u201d declared too truly their\r\nsanguinary designs.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Louis appeared\u2014Louis, whose fears for Fanny had overcome\r\nhis indignation, and who returned to guard her; while she, perceiving\r\nhim, with a burst of joy, called on him to rescue her friends. His cry\r\nof \u201cArretez-vous!\u201d was loud and distinct amidst the uproar. It was\r\nobeyed; and then first he beheld his rival, his oppressor, his enemy in\r\nhis power. At first, rage inflamed every feature, to be replaced by an\r\nexpression of triumph and implacable hatred. Fanny caught the fierce\r\nglance of his eye, and grew pale. She trembled as, trying to be calm,\r\nshe said, \u201cYes, you behold he is here. And you must save him\u2014and your\r\nown soul. Rescue him from death, and be blest that your evil career\r\nenables you at least to perform this one good action.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment Louis seemed seeking for a word, as a man, meaning to stab,\r\nmay fumble for his dagger\u2019s hilt, unable in his agitation to grasp his\r\nweapon.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy friends,\u201d at length he said, \u201clet the women depart\u2014we have promised\r\nit. Ye may deal with the young aristocrat according to his merits.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA la lanterne!\u201d burst in response from a hundred voices.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet his mother first depart!\u201d\r\n\r\nCould it be Louis that spoke these words, and had she loved this man? To\r\nappeal to him was to rouse a tiger from his lair. Another thought darted\r\ninto Fanny\u2019s mind; she scarcely knew what she said or did: but already\r\nknives were drawn; already, with a thrill of horror, she thought she saw\r\nthe blood of her childhood\u2019s playmate spilt like water on the earth. She\r\nrushed forward\u2014she caught the upraised arm of one\u2014\u201cHe is no aristocrat!\u201d\r\nshe cried; \u201che is my husband!\u2014Will you murder one who, forgetting his\r\nbirth, his duty, his honour, has married a peasant girl\u2014one of\r\nyourselves?\u201d\r\n\r\nEven this appeal had little effect upon the mob; but it strangely\r\naffected her cruel lover. Grasping her arm with iron fingers, he cried,\r\n\u201cIs this tale true? Art thou married to that man\u2014his wife?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEven so!\u201d\u2014the words died on her lips as she strove to form them,\r\nterrified by their purport, and the effect they might produce. An\r\ninexplicable expression passed over Chaumont\u2019s face; the fierceness that\r\njealousy had engendered for a moment was exalted almost to madness, and\r\nthen faded wholly away. The stony heart within him softened at once. A\r\ntide of warm, human, and overpowering emotion flowed into his soul: he\r\nlooked on her he had loved, on her whom he had lost for ever; and tears\r\nrushed into his eyes, as he saw her trembling before him.\r\n\r\n\u201cFear not,\u201d at last he said; \u201cfear neither for him nor yourself. Poor\r\ngirl! so young, you shall not lose all\u2014so young, you shall not become a\r\nwidow. He shall be saved!\u201d\r\n\r\nYet it was no easy task, even for him, to stem the awakened passions of\r\nthe bloodthirsty mob. He had spent many an hour in exciting them against\r\ntheir seigneurs, and now at once to control the violence to which he had\r\ngiven rise seemed impossible. Yet his energy, his strong will overcame\r\nall opposition. They should pierce the chevalier\u2019s heart, he swore,\r\nthrough his alone. He prevailed. He took the rein of their mule, and led\r\nthem out of the village. All were silent; Fanny knew not what to say,\r\nand surprise held the others mute. Louis went with them until a turn in\r\nthe road hid them from the view of the village. What his thoughts were,\r\nnone could guess: he looked calm, as resigning the rein into the\r\nchevalier\u2019s hands, he gently bade them \u201cFarewell,\u201d touching his hat in\r\nreply to their salutations. They moved on, and Fanny looked back to\r\ncatch a last view of her lover: he was standing where they left him,\r\nwhen suddenly, instead of returning on his steps into the village, she\r\nsaw him with rapid strides ascend the mountain-side, taking a well-known\r\npath that conducted him away from the scene of his late exploits. His\r\npace was that of a man flying from pursuers\u2014soon he was lost to sight.\r\n\r\nAstonishment still kept the fugitives silent, as they pursued their way;\r\nand when at last joy broke forth, and Madame de Marville, rejoicing in\r\ntheir escape, embraced again and again her son, he with the softest\r\ntenderness thanked Fanny for his life: she answered not, but wept\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\nLate that night they reached the destined ch\u00e2let, and found Monsieur de\r\nMarville arrived. It was a half-ruined miserable habitation perched\r\namong the snows, cold and bare; food was ill to be obtained, and danger\r\nbreathed around them. Fanny attended on them with assiduous care, but\r\nshe never spoke of the scene in the village; and though she strove to\r\nlook the same, Henry never addressed her but she grew pale, and her\r\nvoice trembled. She could not divine her absent lover\u2019s thoughts, but\r\nshe knew that he believed her married to another; and that other,\r\nearnestly though she strove to rule her feelings, became an object of\r\nabhorrence to her.\r\n\r\nThree weeks they passed in this wretched abode; three weeks replete with\r\nalarm, for the district around was in arms, and the life of Monsieur de\r\nMarville loudly threatened. They never slept but they dreaded the\r\napproach of the murderers; food they had little, and the inclement\r\nseason visited them roughly. Fanny seemed to feel no inconvenience; her\r\nvoice was cheerful: to console, encourage, and assist her friends\r\nappeared to occupy her whole heart. At length one night they were roused\r\nby a violent knocking at the door of their hut: Monsieur de Marville and\r\nHenry were on their feet in a moment, seizing their weapons as they\r\nrose. It was a domestic of their own, come to communicate the\r\nintelligence that the troubles were over, that the legal government had\r\nreasserted its authority, and invited the governor to return to Berne.\r\n\r\nThey descended from their mountain refuge, and the name of Louis hovered\r\non Fanny\u2019s lips, but she spoke it not. He seemed everywhere forgotten.\r\nIt was not until some time afterwards that she ascertained the fact that\r\nhe had never been seen or heard of since he had parted from her on the\r\nmorning of their escape. The villagers had waited for him in vain; they\r\nsuspended their designs, for they all depended upon him; but he came\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nMonsieur and Madame de Marville returned to their chateau with their\r\nson, but Fanny remained behind. She would not inhabit the same roof as\r\nHenry; she recoiled even from receiving further benefits from his\r\nparents. What could she do? Louis would doubtless discover the falsehood\r\nof her marriage, but he dared not return; and even if he communicated\r\nwith her, even though yet she loved him, could she unite herself with\r\none accused too truly of the most frightful crimes? At first, these\r\ndoubts agitated her, but by degrees they faded as oblivion closed over\r\nChaumont\u2019s name; and he came not, and she heard not of him, and he was\r\nas dead to her. Then the memory of the past revived in her heart; her\r\nlove awoke with her despair; his mysterious flight became the sole\r\noccupation of her thoughts; time rolled on and brought its changes.\r\nMadame de Marville died\u2014Henry was united to another\u2014Fanny remained, to\r\nher own thoughts, alone in the world. A relation, who lived at Subiaco,\r\nsent for her, and there she went to take up her abode. In vain she\r\nstrove to wean herself from the memory of Louis\u2014her love for him haunted\r\nher soul.\r\n\r\nThere was war in Europe, and every man was converted into a soldier; the\r\ncountry was thinned of its inhabitants, and each victory or defeat\r\nbrought a new conscription. At length peace came again, and its return\r\nwas celebrated with rejoicing. Many a soldier returned to his home\u2014and\r\none came back who had no home. A man, evidently suffering from recent\r\nwounds, wayworn and sick, asked for hospitality at Fanny\u2019s cottage; it\r\nwas readily afforded, and he sat at her cottage fire, and removed his\r\ncap from his brow. His person was bent, his cheeks fallen in; yet those\r\neyes of fire, that quick animated look, which almost brought the bright\r\nexpression of youth back into his face, could never be forgotten. Fanny\r\ngazed almost in alarm, and then in joy, and at last, in her own sweet\r\nvoice, she said, \u201cEt toi, Louis\u2014tu aussi es de retour.\u201d\r\n\r\nLouis had endured many a sorrow and many a hardship, and, most of all,\r\nhe had been called on to wage battle with his own fierce spirit. The\r\nrage and hate which he had sedulously nourished suddenly became his\r\ntormentors and his tyrants\u2014at the moment that love, before too closely\r\nallied to them, emancipated itself from their control. Love, which is\r\nthe source of all that is most generous and noble in our nature, of\r\nself-devotion and of high intent, separated from the alloy he had\r\nblended with it, asserted its undivided power over him; strange that it\r\nshould be so at the moment that he believed that he had lost her he\r\nloved for ever!\r\n\r\nAll his plans had been built for revenge. He would destroy the family\r\nthat oppressed him; unbuild, stone by stone, the proud abode of their\r\ninheritance; he would be the sole refuge and support of his mistress in\r\nexile and in poverty. He had entered upon his criminal career with this\r\ndesign alone, and with the anticipation of ending all by heaping\r\nbenefits and the gifts of fortune upon Fanny. The very steps he had\r\ntaken, he now believed to be those that occasioned his defeat. He had\r\nlost her\u2014the lovely and the good\u2014he had lost her by proving unworthy,\r\nyet not so unworthy was he as to make her the victim of his crimes. The\r\nfamily he had vowed to ruin was now hers, and every injury that befell\r\nthem visited her; to save her he must unweave his pernicious webs; to\r\nkeep her scatheless, his dearest designs must fall to the ground.\r\n\r\nA veil seemed rent before his eyes; he had fled, for he would not assist\r\nin the destruction of her fortunes; he had not returned, for it was\r\ntorture to him to know that she lived, the wife of another. He entered\r\nthe French army, but in every change his altered feelings pursued him,\r\nand to prove himself worthy of her he had lost was the constant aim of\r\nhis ambition. His excellent conduct led to his promotion, and yet mishap\r\nstill waited on him. He was wounded, even dangerously, and became so\r\nincapable of service as to be forced to solicit his dismission. This had\r\noccurred at the end of a hard campaign in Germany, and his intention was\r\nto pass into Italy, where a friend, with whom he had formed an intimacy\r\nin the army, promised to procure him some employment under Government.\r\nHe passed through Subiaco in his way, and, ignorant of its occupiers,\r\nhad asked for hospitality in his mistress\u2019s cottage.\r\n\r\nIf guilt can be expiated by repentance and reform, as is the best lesson\r\nof religion, Louis had expiated his. If constancy in love deserve\r\nreward, these lovers deserved that, which they reaped, in the happiness\r\nconsequent on their union. Her image, side by side with all that is good\r\nin our nature, had dwelt in his heart, which thus became a shrine at\r\nwhich he sacrificed every evil passion. It was a greater bliss than he\r\nhad ever dared to anticipate, to find, that in so doing, he had at the\r\nsame time been conducing to the welfare of her he loved, and that the\r\nlost and idolized being whom he worshipped founded the happiness of her\r\nlife upon his return to virtue, and the constancy of his affection.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XI.\r\n\r\n                         _THE INVISIBLE GIRL._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS slender narrative has no pretensions to the regularity of a story,\r\nor the development of situations and feelings; it is but a slight\r\nsketch, delivered nearly as it was narrated to me by one of the humblest\r\nof the actors concerned: nor will I spin out a circumstance interesting\r\nprincipally from its singularity and truth, but narrate, as concisely as\r\nI can, how I was surprised on visiting what seemed a ruined tower,\r\ncrowning a bleak promontory overhanging the sea, that flows between\r\nWales and Ireland, to find that though the exterior preserved all the\r\nsavage rudeness that betokened many a war with the elements, the\r\ninterior was fitted up somewhat in the guise of a summer-house, for it\r\nwas too small to deserve any other name. It consisted but of the\r\nground-floor, which served as an entrance, and one room above, which was\r\nreached by a staircase made out of the thickness of the wall. This\r\nchamber was floored and carpeted, decorated with elegant furniture; and,\r\nabove all, to attract the attention and excite curiosity, there hung\r\nover the chimney-piece\u2014for to preserve the apartment from damp a\r\nfireplace had been built evidently since it had assumed a guise so\r\ndissimilar to the object of its construction\u2014a picture simply painted in\r\nwater-colours, which deemed more than any part of the adornments of the\r\nroom to be at war with the rudeness of the building, the solitude in\r\nwhich it was placed, and the desolation of the surrounding scenery. This\r\ndrawing represented a lovely girl in the very pride and bloom of youth;\r\nher dress was simple, in the fashion of the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury; her countenance was embellished by a look of mingled innocence\r\nand intelligence, to which was added the imprint of serenity of soul and\r\nnatural cheerfulness. She was reading one of those folio romances which\r\nhave so long been the delight of the enthusiastic and young; her\r\nmandoline was at her feet\u2014her parroquet perched on a huge mirror near\r\nher; the arrangement of furniture and hangings gave token of a luxurious\r\ndwelling, and her attire also evidently that of home and privacy, yet\r\nbore with it an appearance of ease and girlish ornament, as if she\r\nwished to please. Beneath this picture was inscribed in golden letters,\r\n\u201cThe Invisible Girl.\u201d\r\n\r\nRambling about a country nearly uninhabited, having lost my way, and\r\nbeing overtaken by a shower, I had lighted on this dreary-looking\r\ntenement, which seemed to rock in the blast, and to be hung up there as\r\nthe very symbol of desolation. I was gazing wistfully and cursing\r\ninwardly my stars which led me to a ruin that could afford no shelter,\r\nthough the storm began to pelt more seriously than before, when I saw an\r\nold woman\u2019s head popped out from a kind of loophole, and as suddenly\r\nwithdrawn;\u2014a minute after a feminine voice called to me from within, and\r\npenetrating a little brambly maze that screened a door, which I had not\r\nbefore observed, so skilfully had the planter succeeded in concealing\r\nart with nature, I found the good dame standing on the threshold and\r\ninviting me to take refuge within. \u201cI had just come up from our cot hard\r\nby,\u201d she said, \u201cto look after the things, as I do every day, when the\r\nrain came on\u2014will ye walk up till it is over?\u201d I was about to observe\r\nthat the cot hard by, at the venture of a few rain drops, was better\r\nthan a ruined tower, and to ask my kind hostess whether \u201cthe things\u201d\r\nwere pigeons or crows that she was come to look after, when the matting\r\nof the floor and the carpeting of the staircase struck my eye. I was\r\nstill more surprised when I saw the room above; and beyond all, the\r\npicture and its singular inscription, naming her invisible, whom the\r\npainter had coloured forth into very agreeable visibility, awakened my\r\nmost lively curiosity; the result of this, of my exceeding politeness\r\ntowards the old woman, and her own natural garrulity, was a kind of\r\ngarbled narrative which my imagination eked out, and future inquiries\r\nrectified, till it assumed the following form.\r\n\r\nSome years before, in the afternoon of a September day, which, though\r\ntolerably fair, gave many tokens of a tempestuous night, a gentleman\r\narrived at a little coast town about ten miles from this place; he\r\nexpressed his desire to hire a boat to carry him to the town of \u2014\u2014 about\r\nfifteen miles farther on the coast. The menaces which the sky held forth\r\nmade the fishermen loathe to venture, till at length two, one the father\r\nof a numerous family, bribed by the bountiful reward the stranger\r\npromised, the other, the son of my hostess, induced by youthful daring,\r\nagreed to undertake the voyage. The wind was fair, and they hoped to\r\nmake good way before nightfall, and to get into port ere the rising of\r\nthe storm. They pushed off with good cheer, at least the fishermen did;\r\nas for the stranger, the deep mourning which he wore was not half so\r\nblack as the melancholy that wrapt his mind. He looked as if he had\r\nnever smiled\u2014as if some unutterable thought, dark as night and bitter as\r\ndeath, had built its nest within his bosom, and brooded therein\r\neternally; he did not mention his name; but one of the villagers\r\nrecognised him as Henry Vernon, the son of a baronet who possessed a\r\nmansion about three miles distant from the town for which he was bound.\r\nThis mansion was almost abandoned by the family; but Henry had, in a\r\nromantic fit, visited it about three years before, and Sir Peter had\r\nbeen down there during the previous spring for about a couple of months.\r\n\r\nThe boat did not make so much way as was expected; the breeze failed\r\nthem as they got out to sea, and they were fain with oar as well as sail\r\nto try to weather the promontory that jutted out between them and the\r\nspot they desired to reach. They were yet far distant when the shifting\r\nwind began to exert its strength, and to blow with violent though\r\nunequal blasts. Night came on pitchy dark, and the howling waves rose\r\nand broke with frightful violence, menacing to overwhelm the tiny bark\r\nthat dared resist their fury. They were forced to lower every sail, and\r\ntake to their oars; one man was obliged to bale out the water, and\r\nVernon himself took an oar, and rowing with desperate energy, equalled\r\nthe force of the more practised boatmen. There had been much talk\r\nbetween the sailors before the tempest came on; now, except a brief\r\ncommand, all were silent. One thought of his wife and children, and\r\nsilently cursed the caprice of the stranger that endangered in its\r\neffects, not only his life, but their welfare; the other feared less,\r\nfor he was a daring lad, but he worked hard, and had no time for speech;\r\nwhile Vernon bitterly regretting the thoughtlessness which had made him\r\ncause others to share a peril, unimportant as far as he himself was\r\nconcerned, now tried to cheer them with a voice full of animation and\r\ncourage, and now pulled yet more strongly at the oar he held. The only\r\nperson who did not seem wholly intent on the work he was about, was the\r\nman who baled; every now and then he gazed intently round, as if the sea\r\nheld afar off, on its tumultuous waste, some object that he strained his\r\neyes to discern. But all was blank, except as the crests of the high\r\nwaves showed themselves, or far out on the verge of the horizon, a kind\r\nof lifting of the clouds betokened greater violence for the blast. At\r\nlength he exclaimed, \u201cYes, I see it!\u2014the larboard oar!\u2014now! if we can\r\nmake yonder light, we are saved!\u201d Both the rowers instinctively turned\r\ntheir heads,\u2014but cheerless darkness answered their gaze.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou cannot see it,\u201d cried their companion, \u201cbut we are nearing it; and,\r\nplease God, we shall outlive this night.\u201d Soon he took the oar from\r\nVernon\u2019s hand, who, quite exhausted, was failing in his strokes. He rose\r\nand looked for the beacon which promised them safety;\u2014it glimmered with\r\nso faint a ray, that now he said, \u201cI see it;\u201d and again, \u201cit is\r\nnothing:\u201d still, as they made way, it dawned upon his sight, growing\r\nmore steady and distinct as it beamed across the lurid waters, which\r\nthemselves became smoother, so that safety seemed to arise from the\r\nbosom of the ocean under the influence of that flickering gleam.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat beacon is it that helps us at our need?\u201d asked Vernon, as the men,\r\nnow able to manage their oars with greater ease, found breath to answer\r\nhis question.\r\n\r\n\u201cA fairy one, I believe,\u201d replied the elder sailor, \u201cyet no less a true:\r\nit burns in an old tumble-down tower, built on the top of a rock which\r\nlooks over the sea. We never saw it before this summer; and now each\r\nnight it is to be seen,\u2014at least when it is looked for, for we cannot\r\nsee it from our village;\u2014and it is such an out-of-the-way place that no\r\none has need to go near it, except through a chance like this. Some say\r\nit is burnt by witches, some say by smugglers; but this I know, two\r\nparties have been to search, and found nothing but the bare walls of the\r\ntower. All is deserted by day, and dark by night; for no light was to be\r\nseen while we were there, though it burned sprightly enough when we were\r\nout at sea.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have heard say,\u201d observed the younger sailor, \u201cit is burnt by the\r\nghost of a maiden who lost her sweetheart in these parts; he being\r\nwrecked, and his body found at the foot of the tower: she goes by the\r\nname among us of the \u2018Invisible Girl.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nThe voyagers had now reached the landing-place at the foot of the tower.\r\nVernon cast a glance upward,\u2014the light was still burning. With some\r\ndifficulty, struggling with the breakers, and blinded by night, they\r\ncontrived to get their little bark to shore, and to draw her up on the\r\nbeach. They then scrambled up the precipitous pathway, overgrown by\r\nweeds and underwood, and, guided by the more experienced fisherman, they\r\nfound the entrance to the tower; door or gate there was none, and all\r\nwas dark as the tomb, and silent and almost as cold as death.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis will never do,\u201d said Vernon; \u201csurely our hostess will show her\r\nlight, if not herself, and guide our darkling steps by some sign of life\r\nand comfort.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will get to the upper chamber,\u201d said the sailor, \u201cif I can but hit\r\nupon the broken-down steps; but you will find no trace of the Invisible\r\nGirl nor her light either, I warrant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTruly a romantic adventure of the most disagreeable kind,\u201d muttered\r\nVernon, as he stumbled over the unequal ground; \u201cshe of the beacon-light\r\nmust be both ugly and old, or she would not be so peevish and\r\ninhospitable.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith considerable difficulty, and after divers knocks and bruises, the\r\nadventurers at length succeeded in reaching the upper storey; but all\r\nwas blank and bare, and they were fain to stretch themselves on the hard\r\nfloor, when weariness, both of mind and body, conduced to steep their\r\nsenses in sleep.\r\n\r\nLong and sound were the slumbers of the mariners. Vernon but forgot\r\nhimself for an hour; then throwing off drowsiness, and finding his rough\r\ncouch uncongenial to repose, he got up and placed himself at the hole\r\nthat served for a window\u2014for glass there was none, and there being not\r\neven a rough bench, he leant his back against the embrasure, as the only\r\nrest he could find. He had forgotten his danger, the mysterious beacon,\r\nand its invisible guardian: his thoughts were occupied on the horrors of\r\nhis own fate, and the unspeakable wretchedness that sat like a nightmare\r\non his heart.\r\n\r\nIt would require a good-sized volume to relate the causes which had\r\nchanged the once happy Vernon into the most woful mourner that ever\r\nclung to the outer trappings of grief, as slight though cherished\r\nsymbols of the wretchedness within. Henry was the only child of Sir\r\nPeter Vernon, and as much spoiled by his father\u2019s idolatry as the old\r\nbaronet\u2019s violent and tyrannical temper would permit. A young orphan was\r\neducated in his father\u2019s house, who in the same way was treated with\r\ngenerosity and kindness, and yet who lived in deep awe of Sir Peter\u2019s\r\nauthority, who was a widower; and these two children were all he had to\r\nexert his power over, or to whom to extend his affection. Rosina was a\r\ncheerful-tempered girl, a little timid, and careful to avoid displeasing\r\nher protector; but so docile, so kind-hearted, and so affectionate, that\r\nshe felt even less than Henry the discordant spirit of his parent. It is\r\na tale often told; they were playmates and companions in childhood, and\r\nlovers in after days. Rosina was frightened to imagine that this secret\r\naffection, and the vows they pledged, might be disapproved of by Sir\r\nPeter. But sometimes she consoled herself by thinking that perhaps she\r\nwas in reality her Henry\u2019s destined bride, brought up with him under the\r\ndesign of their future union; and Henry, while he felt that this was not\r\nthe case, resolved to wait only until he was of age to declare and\r\naccomplish his wishes in making the sweet Rosina his wife. Meanwhile he\r\nwas careful to avoid premature discovery of his intentions, so to secure\r\nhis beloved girl from persecution and insult. The old gentleman was very\r\nconveniently blind; he lived always in the country, and the lovers spent\r\ntheir lives together, unrebuked and uncontrolled. It was enough that\r\nRosina played on her mandoline, and sang Sir Peter to sleep every day\r\nafter dinner; she was the sole female in the house above the rank of a\r\nservant, and had her own way in the disposal of her time. Even when Sir\r\nPeter frowned, her innocent caresses and sweet voice were powerful to\r\nsmooth the rough current of his temper. If ever human spirit lived in an\r\nearthly paradise, Rosina did at this time: her pure love was made happy\r\nby Henry\u2019s constant presence; and the confidence they felt in each\r\nother, and the security with which they looked forward to the future,\r\nrendered their path one of roses under a cloudless sky. Sir Peter was\r\nthe slight drawback that only rendered their _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_ more\r\ndelightful, and gave value to the sympathy they each bestowed on the\r\nother. All at once an ominous personage made its appearance in Vernon\r\nPlace, in the shape of a widow sister of Sir Peter, who, having\r\nsucceeded in killing her husband and children with the effects of her\r\nvile temper, came, like a harpy, greedy for new prey, under her\r\nbrother\u2019s roof. She too soon detected the attachment of the unsuspicious\r\npair. She made all speed to impart her discovery to her brother, and at\r\nonce to restrain and inflame his rage. Through her contrivance Henry was\r\nsuddenly despatched on his travels abroad, that the coast might be clear\r\nfor the persecution of Rosina; and then the richest of the lovely girl\u2019s\r\nmany admirers, whom, under Sir Peter\u2019s single reign, she was allowed,\r\nnay, almost commanded, to dismiss, so desirous was he of keeping her for\r\nhis own comfort, was selected, and she was ordered to marry him. The\r\nscenes of violence to which she was now exposed, the bitter taunts of\r\nthe odious Mrs. Bainbridge, and the reckless fury of Sir Peter, were the\r\nmore frightful and overwhelming from their novelty. To all she could\r\nonly oppose a silent, tearful, but immutable steadiness of purpose: no\r\nthreats, no rage could extort from her more than a touching prayer that\r\nthey would not hate her, because she could not obey.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere must be something we don\u2019t see under all this,\u201d said Mrs.\r\nBainbridge; \u201ctake my word for it, brother, she corresponds secretly with\r\nHenry. Let us take her down to your seat in Wales, where she will have\r\nno pensioned beggars to assist her; and we shall see if her spirit be\r\nnot bent to our purpose.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir Peter consented, and they all three took up their abode in the\r\nsolitary and dreary-looking house before alluded to as belonging to the\r\nfamily. Here poor Rosina\u2019s sufferings grew intolerable. Before,\r\nsurrounded by well-known scenes, and in perpetual intercourse with kind\r\nand familiar faces, she had not despaired in the end of conquering by\r\nher patience the cruelty of her persecutors;\u2014nor had she written to\r\nHenry, for his name had not been mentioned by his relatives, nor their\r\nattachment alluded to, and she felt an instinctive wish to escape the\r\ndangers about her without his being annoyed, or the sacred secret of her\r\nlove being laid bare, and wronged by the vulgar abuse of his aunt or the\r\nbitter curses of his father. But when she was taken to Wales, and made a\r\nprisoner in her apartment, when the flinty mountains about her seemed\r\nfeebly to imitate the stony hearts she had to deal with, her courage\r\nbegan to fail. The only attendant permitted to approach her was Mrs.\r\nBainbridge\u2019s maid; and under the tutelage of her fiend-like mistress,\r\nthis woman was used as a decoy to entice the poor prisoner into\r\nconfidence, and then to be betrayed. The simple, kind-hearted Rosina was\r\na facile dupe, and at last, in the excess of her despair, wrote to\r\nHenry, and gave the letter to this woman to be forwarded. The letter in\r\nitself would have softened marble; it did not speak of their mutual\r\nvows, it but asked him to intercede with his father, that he would\r\nrestore her to the place she had formerly held in his affections, and\r\ncease from a cruelty that would destroy her. \u201cFor I may die,\u201d wrote the\r\nhapless girl, \u201cbut marry another\u2014never!\u201d That single word, indeed, had\r\nsufficed to betray her secret, had it not been already discovered; as it\r\nwas, it gave increased fury to Sir Peter, as his sister triumphantly\r\npointed it out to him, for it need hardly be said that while the ink of\r\nthe address was yet wet, and the seal still warm, Rosina\u2019s letter was\r\ncarried to this lady. The culprit was summoned before them. What ensued\r\nnone could tell; for their own sakes the cruel pair tried to palliate\r\ntheir part. Voices were high, and the soft murmur of Rosina\u2019s tone was\r\nlost in the howling of Sir Peter and the snarling of his sister. \u201cOut of\r\ndoors you shall go,\u201d roared the old man; \u201cunder my roof you shall not\r\nspend another night.\u201d And the words infamous seductress, and worse, such\r\nas had never met the poor girl\u2019s ear before, were caught by listening\r\nservants; and to each angry speech of the baronet, Mrs. Bainbridge added\r\nan envenomed point worse than all.\r\n\r\nMore dead then alive, Rosina was at last dismissed. Whether guided by\r\ndespair, whether she took Sir Peter\u2019s threats literally, or whether his\r\nsister\u2019s orders were more decisive, none knew, but Rosina left the\r\nhouse; a servant saw her cross the park, weeping, and wringing her hands\r\nas she went. What became of her none could tell; her disappearance was\r\nnot disclosed to Sir Peter till the following day, and then he showed by\r\nhis anxiety to trace her steps and to find her, that his words had been\r\nbut idle threats. The truth was, that though Sir Peter went to frightful\r\nlengths to prevent the marriage of the heir of his house with the\r\nportionless orphan, the object of his charity, yet in his heart he loved\r\nRosina, and half his violence to her rose from anger at himself for\r\ntreating her so ill. Now remorse began to sting him, as messenger after\r\nmessenger came back without tidings of his victim. He dared not confess\r\nhis worst fears to himself; and when his inhuman sister, trying to\r\nharden her conscience by angry words, cried, \u201cThe vile hussy has too\r\nsurely made away with herself out of revenge to us,\u201d an oath the most\r\ntremendous, and a look sufficient to make even her tremble, commanded\r\nher silence. Her conjecture, however, appeared too true: a dark and\r\nrushing stream that flowed at the extremity of the park had doubtless\r\nreceived the lovely form, and quenched the life of this unfortunate\r\ngirl. Sir Peter, when his endeavours to find her proved fruitless,\r\nreturned to town, haunted by the image of his victim, and forced to\r\nacknowledge in his own heart that he would willingly lay down his life,\r\ncould he see her again, even though it were as the bride of his son\u2014his\r\nson, before whose questioning he quailed like the veriest coward; for\r\nwhen Henry was told of the death of Rosina, he suddenly returned from\r\nabroad to ask the cause\u2014to visit her grave, and mourn her loss in the\r\ngroves and valleys which had been the scenes of their mutual happiness.\r\nHe made a thousand inquiries, and an ominous silence alone replied.\r\nGrowing more earnest and more anxious, at length he drew from servants\r\nand dependents, and his odious aunt herself, the whole dreadful truth.\r\nFrom that moment despair struck his heart, and misery named him her own.\r\nHe fled from his father\u2019s presence; and the recollection that one whom\r\nhe ought to revere was guilty of so dark a crime, haunted him, as of old\r\nthe Eumenides tormented the souls of men given up to their torturings.\r\nHis first, his only wish, was to visit Wales, and to learn if any new\r\ndiscovery had been made, and whether it were possible to recover the\r\nmortal remains of the lost Rosina, so to satisfy the unquiet longings of\r\nhis miserable heart. On this expedition was he bound when he made his\r\nappearance at the village before named; and now, in the deserted tower,\r\nhis thoughts were busy with images of despair and death, and what his\r\nbeloved one had suffered before her gentle nature had been goaded to\r\nsuch a deed of woe.\r\n\r\nWhile immersed in gloomy reverie, to which the monotonous roaring of the\r\nsea made fit accompaniment, hours flew on, and Vernon was at last aware\r\nthat the light of morning was creeping from out its eastern retreat, and\r\ndawning over the wild ocean, which still broke in furious tumult on the\r\nrocky beach. His companions now roused themselves, and prepared to\r\ndepart. The food they had brought with them was damaged by sea-water,\r\nand their hunger, after hard labour and many hours\u2019 fasting, had become\r\nravenous. It was impossible to put to sea in their shattered boat; but\r\nthere stood a fisher\u2019s cot about two miles off, in a recess in the bay,\r\nof which the promontory on which the tower stood formed one side; and to\r\nthis they hastened to repair. They did not spend a second thought on the\r\nlight which had saved them, nor its cause, but left the ruin in search\r\nof a more hospitable asylum. Vernon cast his eyes round as he quitted\r\nit, but no vestige of an inhabitant met his eye, and he began to\r\npersuade himself that the beacon had been a creation of fancy merely.\r\nArriving at the cottage in question, which was inhabited by a fisherman\r\nand his family, they made a homely breakfast, and then prepared to\r\nreturn to the tower, to refit their boat, and, if possible, bring her\r\nround. Vernon accompanied them, together with their host and his son.\r\nSeveral questions were asked concerning the Invisible Girl and her\r\nlight, each agreeing that the apparition was novel, and not one being\r\nable to give even an explanation of how the name had become affixed to\r\nthe unknown cause of this singular appearance; though both of the men of\r\nthe cottage affirmed that once or twice they had seen a female figure in\r\nthe adjacent wood, and that now and then a stranger girl made her\r\nappearance at another cot a mile off, on the other side of the\r\npromontory, and bought bread; they suspected both these to be the same,\r\nbut could not tell. The inhabitants of the cot, indeed, appeared too\r\nstupid even to feel curiosity, and had never made any attempt at\r\ndiscovery. The whole day was spent by the sailors in repairing the boat;\r\nand the sound of hammers, and the voices of the men at work, resounded\r\nalong the coast, mingled with the dashing of the waves. This was no time\r\nto explore the ruin for one who, whether human or supernatural, so\r\nevidently withdrew herself from intercourse with every living being.\r\nVernon, however, went over the tower, and searched every nook in vain.\r\nThe dingy bare walls bore no token of serving as a shelter; and even a\r\nlittle recess in the wall of the staircase, which he had not before\r\nobserved, was equally empty and desolate. Quitting the tower, he\r\nwandered in the pine wood that surrounded it, and, giving up all thought\r\nof solving the mystery, was soon engrossed by thoughts that touched his\r\nheart more nearly, when suddenly there appeared on the ground at his\r\nfeet the vision of a slipper. Since Cinderella so tiny a slipper had\r\nnever been seen; as plain as shoe could speak, it told a tale of\r\nelegance, loveliness, and youth. Vernon picked it up. He had often\r\nadmired Rosina\u2019s singularly small foot, and his first thought was a\r\nquestion whether this little slipper would have fitted it. It was very\r\nstrange!\u2014it must belong to the Invisible Girl. Then there was a fairy\r\nform that kindled that light\u2014a form of such material substance that its\r\nfoot needed to be shod; and yet how shod?\u2014with kid so fine, and of shape\r\nso exquisite, that it exactly resembled such as Rosina wore! Again the\r\nrecurrence of the image of the beloved dead came forcibly across him;\r\nand a thousand home-felt associations, childish yet sweet, and\r\nlover-like though trifling, so filled Vernon\u2019s heart, that he threw\r\nhimself his length on the ground, and wept more bitterly than ever the\r\nmiserable fate of the sweet orphan.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the men quitted their work, and Vernon returned with them\r\nto the cot where they were to sleep, intending to pursue their voyage,\r\nweather permitting, the following morning. Vernon said nothing of his\r\nslipper, but returned with his rough associates. Often he looked back;\r\nbut the tower rose darkly over the dim waves, and no light appeared.\r\nPreparations had been made in the cot for their accommodation, and the\r\nonly bed in it was offered Vernon; but he refused to deprive his\r\nhostess, and, spreading his cloak on a heap of dry leaves, endeavoured\r\nto give himself up to repose. He slept for some hours; and when he\r\nawoke, all was still, save that the hard breathing of the sleepers in\r\nthe same room with him interrupted the silence. He rose, and, going to\r\nthe window, looked out over the now placid sea towards the mystic tower.\r\nThe light was burning there, sending its slender rays across the waves.\r\nCongratulating himself on a circumstance he had not anticipated, Vernon\r\nsoftly left the cottage, and, wrapping his cloak round him, walked with\r\na swift pace round the bay towards the tower. He reached it; still the\r\nlight was burning. To enter and restore the maiden her shoe, would be\r\nbut an act of courtesy; and Vernon intended to do this with such caution\r\nas to come unaware, before its wearer could, with her accustomed arts,\r\nwithdraw herself from his eyes; but, unluckily, while yet making his way\r\nup the narrow pathway, his foot dislodged a loose fragment, that fell\r\nwith crash and sound down the precipice. He sprung forward, on this, to\r\nretrieve by speed the advantage he had lost by this unlucky accident. He\r\nreached the door; he entered: all was silent, but also all was dark. He\r\npaused in the room below; he felt sure that a slight sound met his ear.\r\nHe ascended the steps, and entered the upper chamber; but blank\r\nobscurity met his penetrating gaze, the starless night admitted not even\r\na twilight glimmer through the only aperture. He closed his eyes, to\r\ntry, on opening them again, to be able to catch some faint, wandering\r\nray on the visual nerve; but it was in vain. He groped round the room;\r\nhe stood still, and held his breath; and then, listening intently, he\r\nfelt sure that another occupied the chamber with him, and that its\r\natmosphere was slightly agitated by another\u2019s respiration. He remembered\r\nthe recess in the staircase; but before he approached it he spoke;\u2014he\r\nhesitated a moment what to say. \u201cI must believe,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\r\nmisfortune alone can cause your seclusion; and if the assistance of a\r\nman\u2014of a gentleman\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\nAn exclamation interrupted him; a voice from the grave spoke his\r\nname\u2014the accents of Rosina syllabled, \u201cHenry!\u2014is it indeed Henry whom I\r\nhear?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe rushed forward, directed by the sound, and clasped in his arms the\r\nliving form of his own lamented girl\u2014his own Invisible Girl he called\r\nher; for even yet, as he felt her heart beat near his, and as he\r\nentwined her waist with his arm, supporting her as she almost sank to\r\nthe ground with agitation, he could not see her; and, as her sobs\r\nprevented her speech, no sense but the instinctive one that filled his\r\nheart with tumultuous gladness, told him that the slender, wasted form\r\nhe pressed so fondly was the living shadow of the Hebe beauty he had\r\nadored.\r\n\r\nThe morning saw this pair thus strangely restored to each other on the\r\ntranquil sea, sailing with a fair wind for L\u2014\u2014, whence they were to\r\nproceed to Sir Peter\u2019s seat, which, three months before, Rosina had\r\nquitted in such agony and terror. The morning light dispelled the\r\nshadows that had veiled her, and disclosed the fair person of the\r\nInvisible Girl. Altered indeed she was by suffering and woe, but still\r\nthe same sweet smile played on her lips, and the tender light of her\r\nsoft blue eyes were all her own. Vernon drew out the slipper, and showed\r\nthe cause that had occasioned him to resolve to discover the guardian of\r\nthe mystic beacon; even now he dared not inquire how she had existed in\r\nthat desolate spot, or wherefore she had so sedulously avoided\r\nobservation, when the right thing to have been done was to have sought\r\nhim immediately, under whose care, protected by whose love, no danger\r\nneed be feared. But Rosina shrunk from him as he spoke, and a deathlike\r\npallor came over her cheek, as she faintly whispered, \u201cYour father\u2019s\r\ncurse\u2014your father\u2019s dreadful threats!\u201d It appeared, indeed, that Sir\r\nPeter\u2019s violence, and the cruelty of Mrs. Bainbridge, had succeeded in\r\nimpressing Rosina with wild and unvanquishable terror. She had fled from\r\ntheir house without plan or forethought\u2014driven by frantic horror and\r\noverwhelming fear, she had left it with scarcely any money, and there\r\nseemed to her no possibility of either returning or proceeding onward.\r\nShe had no friend except Henry in the wide world; whither could she\r\ngo?\u2014to have sought Henry would have sealed their fates to misery; for,\r\nwith an oath, Sir Peter had declared he would rather see them both in\r\ntheir coffins than married. After wandering about, hiding by day, and\r\nonly venturing forth at night, she had come to this deserted tower,\r\nwhich seemed a place of refuge. How she had lived since then she could\r\nhardly tell: she had lingered in the woods by day, or slept in the vault\r\nof the tower, an asylum none were acquainted with or had discovered: by\r\nnight she burned the pinecones of the wood, and night was her dearest\r\ntime; for it seemed to her as if security came with darkness. She was\r\nunaware that Sir Peter had left that part of the country, and was\r\nterrified lest her hiding-place should be revealed to him. Her only hope\r\nwas that Henry would return\u2014that Henry would never rest till he had\r\nfound her. She confessed that the long interval and the approach of\r\nwinter had visited her with dismay; she feared that, as her strength was\r\nfailing, and her form wasting to a skeleton, that she might die, and\r\nnever see her own Henry more.\r\n\r\nAn illness, indeed, in spite of all his care, followed her restoration\r\nto security and the comforts of civilised life; many months went by\r\nbefore the bloom revisiting her cheeks, and her limbs regaining their\r\nroundness, she resembled once more the picture drawn of her in her days\r\nof bliss before any visitation of sorrow. It was a copy of this portrait\r\nthat decorated the tower, the scene of her suffering, in which I had\r\nfound shelter. Sir Peter, overjoyed to be relieved from the pangs of\r\nremorse, and delighted again to see his orphan ward, whom he really\r\nloved, was now as eager as before he had been averse to bless her union\r\nwith his son. Mrs. Bainbridge they never saw again. But each year they\r\nspent a few months in their Welsh mansion, the scene of their early\r\nwedded happiness, and the spot where again poor Rosina had awoke to life\r\nand joy after her cruel persecutions. Henry\u2019s fond care had fitted up\r\nthe tower, and decorated it as I saw; and often did he come over, with\r\nhis \u201cInvisible Girl,\u201d to renew, in the very scene of its occurrence, the\r\nremembrance of all the incidents which had led to their meeting again,\r\nduring the shades of night, in that sequestered ruin.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XII.\r\n\r\n                       _THE BROTHER AND SISTER._\r\n\r\n                           AN ITALIAN STORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is well known that the hatred borne by one family against another,\r\nand the strife of parties, which often led to bloodshed in the Italian\r\ncities during the Middle Ages, so vividly described by Shakespeare in\r\n\u201cRomeo and Juliet,\u201d was not confined to the Montecchi and Ciapelletti of\r\nVerona, but existed with equal animosity in almost every other town of\r\nthat beautiful peninsula. The greatest men among them were the victims;\r\nand crowds of exiles\u2014families who but the day before were in the full\r\nenjoyment of the luxuries of life and the endearing associations of\r\nhome\u2014were every now and then seen issuing from the gates of their native\r\ncities, deprived of every possession, and with melancholy and slow steps\r\ndragging their wearied limbs to the nearest asylum offered them, thence\r\nto commence a new career of dependence and poverty, to endure to the end\r\nof their lives, or until some lucky accident should enable them to\r\nchange places with their enemies, making those the sufferers who were\r\nlate the tyrants. In that country, where each town formed an independent\r\nState, to change one for the other was to depart from the spot cherished\r\nas a country and a home for distant banishment\u2014or worse; for as each\r\ncity entertained either hatred or contempt for its neighbour, it often\r\nhappened that the mourning exile was obliged to take up his abode among\r\na people whom he had injured or scoffed. Foreign service offered a\r\nresource to the young and bold among the men. But lovely Italy was to be\r\nleft, the ties of young hearts severed, and all the endearing\r\nassociations of kin and country broken and scattered for ever. The\r\nItalians were always peculiarly susceptible to these misfortunes. They\r\nloved their native walls, the abodes of their ancestors, the familiar\r\nscenes of youth, with all the passionate fervour characteristic of that\r\nclime.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore no uncommon thing for any one among them, like Foscari\r\nof Venice, to prefer destitution and danger in their own city, to a\r\nprecarious subsistence among strangers in distant lands; or, if\r\ncompelled to quit the beloved precincts of their native walls, still to\r\nhover near, ready to avail themselves of the first occasion that should\r\npresent itself for reversing the decree that condemned them to misery.\r\n\r\nFor three days and nights there had been warfare in the streets of\r\nSiena,\u2014blood flowed in torrents,\u2014yet the cries and groans of the fallen\r\nbut excited their friends to avenge them\u2014not their foes to spare. On the\r\nfourth morning, Ugo Mancini, with a scanty band of followers, was driven\r\nfrom the town; succours from Florence had arrived for his enemies, and\r\nhe was forced to yield. Burning with rage, writhing with an impotent\r\nthirst for vengeance, Ugo went round to the neighbouring villages to\r\nrouse them, not against his native town, but the victorious Tolomei.\r\nUnsuccessful in these endeavours, he next took the more equivocal step\r\nof seeking warlike aid from the Pisans. But Florence kept Pisa in check,\r\nand Ugo found only an inglorious refuge where he had hoped to acquire\r\nactive allies. He had been wounded in these struggles; but, animated by\r\na superhuman spirit, he had forgotten his pain and surmounted his\r\nweakness; nor was it until a cold refusal was returned to his energetic\r\nrepresentations, that he sank beneath his physical sufferings. He was\r\nstretched on a bed of torture when he received intelligence that an\r\nedict of perpetual banishment and confiscation of property was passed\r\nagainst him. His two children, beggars now, were sent to him. His wife\r\nwas dead, and these were all of near relations that he possessed. His\r\nbitter feelings were still too paramount for him to receive comfort from\r\ntheir presence; yet these agitated and burning emotions appeared in\r\nafter-times a remnant of happiness compared to the total loss of every\r\nhope\u2014the wasting inaction of sickness and of poverty.\r\n\r\nFor five years Ugo Mancini lay stretched on his couch, alternating\r\nbetween states of intense pain and overpowering weakness; and then he\r\ndied. During this interval, the wreck of his fortunes, consisting of the\r\nrent of a small farm, and the use of some money lent, scantily supported\r\nhim. His few relatives and followers were obliged to seek their\r\nsubsistence elsewhere, and he remained alone to his pain, and to his two\r\nchildren, who yet clung to the paternal side.\r\n\r\nHatred to his foes, and love for his native town, were the sentiments\r\nthat possessed his soul, and which he imparted in their full force to\r\nthe plastic mind of his son, which received like molten metal the stamp\r\nhe desired to impress. Lorenzo was scarcely twelve years old at the\r\nperiod of his father\u2019s exile, and he naturally turned with fondness\r\ntowards the spot where he had enjoyed every happiness, where each hour\r\nhad been spent in light-hearted hilarity, and the kindness and\r\nobservance of many attended on his steps. Now, how sad the contrast!\u2014dim\r\npenury\u2014a solitude cheered by no encouraging smiles or sunny\r\nflatteries\u2014perpetual attendance on his father, and untimely cares, cast\r\ntheir dark shadows over his altered lot.\r\n\r\nLorenzo was a few years older than his sister. Friendless and destitute\r\nas was the exile\u2019s family, it was he who overlooked its moderate\r\ndisbursements, who was at once his father\u2019s nurse and his sister\u2019s\r\nguardian, and acted as the head of the family during the incapacity of\r\nhis parent. But instead of being narrowed or broken in spirit by these\r\nburdens, his ardent soul rose to meet them, and grew enlarged and lofty\r\nfrom the very calls made upon it. His look was serious, not careworn;\r\nhis manner calm, not humble; his voice had all the tenderness of a\r\nwoman\u2014his eye all the pride and fire of a hero.\r\n\r\nStill his unhappy father wasted away, and Lorenzo\u2019s hours were entirely\r\nspent beside his bed. He was indefatigable in his attentions\u2014weariness\r\nnever seemed to overcome him. His limbs were always alert\u2014his speech\r\ninspiriting and kind. His only pastime was during any interval in his\r\nparent\u2019s sufferings, to listen to his eulogiums on his native town, and\r\nto the history of the wrongs which, from time immemorial, the Mancini\r\nhad endured from the Tolomei. Lorenzo, though replete with noble\r\nqualities, was still an Italian; and fervent love for his birthplace,\r\nand violent hatred towards the foes of his house, were the darling\r\npassions of his heart. Nursed in loneliness, they acquired vigour; and\r\nthe nights he spent in watching his father were varied by musing on the\r\ncareer he should hereafter follow\u2014his return to his beloved Siena, and\r\nthe vengeance he would take on his enemies.\r\n\r\nUgo often said, I die because I am an exile:\u2014at length these words were\r\nfulfilled, and the unhappy man sank beneath the ills of fortune. Lorenzo\r\nsaw his beloved father expire\u2014his father, whom he loved. He seemed to\r\ndeposit in his obscure grave all that best deserved reverence and honour\r\nin the world; and turning away his steps, he lamented the loss of the\r\nsad occupation of so many years, and regretted the exchange he made from\r\nhis father\u2019s sick bed to a lonely and unprized freedom.\r\n\r\nThe first use he made of the liberty he had thus acquired was to return\r\nto Siena with his sister. He entered his native town as if it were a\r\nparadise, and he found it a desert in all save the hues of beauty and\r\ndelight with which his imagination loved to invest it. There was no one\r\nto whom he could draw near in friendship within the whole circuit of its\r\nwalls. According to the barbarous usage of the times, his father\u2019s\r\npalace had been razed, and the mournful ruins stood as a tomb to\r\ncommemorate the fall of his fortunes. Not as such did Lorenzo view them;\r\nhe often stole out at nightfall, when the stars alone beheld his\r\nenthusiasm, and, clambering to the highest part of the massy fragments,\r\nspent long hours in mentally rebuilding the desolate walls, and in\r\nconsecrating once again the weed-grown hearth to family love and\r\nhospitable festivity. It seemed to him that the air was more balmy and\r\nlight, breathed amidst these memorials of the past; and his heart warmed\r\nwith rapture over the tale they told of what his progenitors had\r\nbeen\u2014what he again would be.\r\n\r\nYet, had he viewed his position sanely, he would have found it full of\r\nmortification and pain; and he would have become aware that his native\r\ntown was perhaps the only place in the world where his ambition would\r\nfail in the attainment of its aim. The Tolomei reigned over it. They had\r\nled its citizens to conquest, and enriched them with spoils. They were\r\nadored; and to flatter them, the populace were prone to revile and scoff\r\nat the name of Mancini. Lorenzo did not possess one friend within its\r\nwalls: he heard the murmur of hatred as he passed along, and beheld his\r\nenemies raised to the pinnacle of power and honour; and yet, so\r\nstrangely framed is the human heart, that he continued to love Siena,\r\nand would not have exchanged his obscure and penurious abode within its\r\nwalls to become the favoured follower of the German Emperor. Such a\r\nplace, through education and the natural prejudices of man, did Siena\r\nhold in his imagination, that a lowly condition there seemed a nobler\r\ndestiny than to be great in any other spot.\r\n\r\nTo win back the friendship of its citizens and humble his enemies was\r\nthe dream that shed so sweet an influence over his darkened hours. He\r\ndedicated his whole being to this work, and he did not doubt but that he\r\nshould succeed. The house of Tolomei had for its chief a youth but a\r\nyear or two older than himself\u2014with him, when an opportunity should\r\npresent itself, he would enter the lists. It seemed the bounty of\r\nProvidence that gave him one so nearly equal with whom to contend; and\r\nduring the interval that must elapse before they could clash, he was\r\nbusy in educating himself for the struggle. Count Fabian dei Tolomei\r\nbore the reputation of being a youth full of promise and talent; and\r\nLorenzo was glad to anticipate a worthy antagonist. He occupied himself\r\nin the practice of arms, and applied with perseverance to the study of\r\nthe few books that fell in his way. He appeared in the market-place on\r\npublic occasions modestly attired; yet his height, his dignified\r\ncarriage, and the thoughtful cast of his noble countenance, drew the\r\nobservation of the bystanders;\u2014though, such was the prejudice against\r\nhis name, and the flattery of the triumphant party, that taunts and\r\nmaledictions followed him. His nobility of appearance was called pride;\r\nhis affability, meanness; his aspiring views, faction;\u2014and it was\r\ndeclared that it would be a happy day when he should no longer blot\r\ntheir sunshine with his shadow. Lorenzo smiled,\u2014he disdained to resent,\r\nor even to feel, the mistaken insults of the crowd, who, if fortune\r\nchanged, would the next day throw up their caps for him. It was only\r\nwhen loftier foes approached that his brow grew dark, that he drew\r\nhimself up to his full height, repaying their scorn with glances of\r\ndefiance and hate.\r\n\r\nBut although he was ready in his own person to encounter the contumely\r\nof his townsmen, and walked on with placid mien, regardless of their\r\nsneers, he carefully guarded his sister from such scenes. She was led by\r\nhim each morning, closely veiled, to hear mass in an obscure church. And\r\nwhen, on feast-days, the public walks were crowded with cavaliers and\r\ndames in splendid attire, and with citizens and peasants in their\r\nholiday garb, this gentle pair might be seen in some solitary and shady\r\nspot, Flora knew none to love except her brother\u2014she had grown under his\r\neyes from infancy; and while he attended on the sick-bed of their\r\nfather, he was father, brother, tutor, guardian to her\u2014the fondest\r\nmother could not have been more indulgent; and yet there was mingled a\r\nsomething beyond, pertaining to their difference of sex. Uniformly\r\nobservant and kind, he treated her as if she had been a high-born\r\ndamsel, nurtured in her gayest bower.\r\n\r\nHer attire was simple\u2014but thus, she was instructed, it befitted every\r\ndamsel to dress; her needle-works were such as a princess might have\r\nemulated; and while she learnt under her brother\u2019s tutelage to be\r\nreserved, studious of obscurity, and always occupied, she was taught\r\nthat such were the virtues becoming her sex, and no idea of dependence\r\nor penury was raised in her mind. Had he been the sole human being that\r\napproached her, she might have believed herself to be on a level with\r\nthe highest in the land; but coming in contact with dependants in the\r\nhumble class of life, Flora became acquainted with her true position;\r\nand learnt, at the same time, to understand and appreciate the\r\nunequalled kindness and virtues of her brother.\r\n\r\nTwo years passed while brother and sister continued, in obscurity and\r\npoverty, cherishing hope, honour, and mutual love. If an anxious thought\r\never crossed Lorenzo, it was for the future destiny of Flora, whose\r\nbeauty as a child gave promise of perfect loveliness hereafter. For her\r\nsake he was anxious to begin the career he had marked out for himself,\r\nand resolved no longer to delay his endeavours to revive his party in\r\nSiena, and to seek rather than avoid a contest with the young Count\r\nFabian, on whose overthrow he would rise\u2014Count Fabian, the darling of\r\nthe citizens, vaunted as a model for a youthful cavalier, abounding in\r\ngood qualities, and so adorned by gallantry, subtle wit, and gay,\r\nwinning manners, that he stepped by right of nature, as well as birth,\r\non the pedestal which exalted him the idol of all around.\r\n\r\nIt was on a day of public feasting that Lorenzo first presented himself\r\nin rivalship with Fabian. His person was unknown to the count, who, in\r\nall the pride of rich dress and splendid accoutrements, looked with a\r\nsmile of patronage on the poorly-mounted and plainly-attired youth, who\r\npresented himself to run a tilt with him. But before the challenge was\r\naccepted, the name of his antagonist was whispered to Fabian; then, all\r\nthe bitterness engendered by family feuds; all the spirit of vengeance,\r\nwhich had been taught as a religion, arose at once in the young noble\u2019s\r\nheart; he wheeled round his steed, and, riding rudely up to his\r\ncompetitor, ordered him instantly to retire from the course, nor dare to\r\ndisturb the revels of the citizens by the hated presence of a Mancini.\r\nLorenzo answered with equal scorn; and Fabian, governed by\r\nuncontrollable passion, called together his followers to drive the youth\r\nwith ignominy from the lists. A fearful array was mustered against the\r\nhateful intruder; but had their number been trebled, the towering spirit\r\nof Lorenzo had met them all. One fell\u2014another was disabled by his weapon\r\nbefore he was disarmed and made prisoner; but his bravery did not avail\r\nto extract admiration from his prejudiced foes: they rather poured\r\nexecrations on him for its disastrous effects, as they hurried him to a\r\ndungeon, and called loudly for his punishment and death.\r\n\r\nFar from this scene of turmoil and bloodshed, in her poor but quiet\r\nchamber, in a remote and obscure part of the town, sat Flora, occupied\r\nby her embroidery, musing, as she worked, on her brother\u2019s project, and\r\nanticipating his success. Hours passed, and Lorenzo did not return; the\r\nday declined, and still he tarried. Flora\u2019s busy fancy forged a thousand\r\ncauses for the delay. Her brother\u2019s prowess had awaked the chilly zeal\r\nof the partisans of their family;\u2014he was doubtless feasting among them,\r\nand the first stone was laid for the rebuilding of their house. At last,\r\na rush of steps upon the staircase, and a confused clamour of female\r\nvoices calling loudly for admittance, made her rise and open the\r\ndoor;\u2014in rushed several women\u2014dismay was painted on their faces\u2014their\r\nwords flowed in torrents\u2014their eager gestures helped them to a meaning,\r\nand, though not without difficulty, amidst the confusion, Flora heard of\r\nthe disaster and imprisonment of her brother\u2014of the blood shed by his\r\nhand, and the fatal issue that such a deed ensured. She grew pale as\r\nmarble. Her young heart was filled with speechless terror; she could\r\nform no image of the thing she dreaded, but its indistinct idea was full\r\nof fear. Lorenzo was in prison\u2014Count Fabian had placed him there\u2014he was\r\nto die! Overwhelmed for a moment by such tidings, yet she rose above\r\ntheir benumbing power, and without proffering a word, or listening to\r\nthe questions and remonstrances of the women, she rushed past them, down\r\nthe high staircase, into the street; and then with swift pace to where\r\nthe public prison was situated. She knew the spot she wished to reach,\r\nbut she had so seldom quitted her home that she soon got entangled among\r\nthe streets, and proceeded onwards at random. Breathless, at length, she\r\npaused before the lofty portal of a large palace\u2014no one was near\u2014the\r\nfast fading twilight of an Italian evening had deepened into absolute\r\ndarkness. At this moment the glare of flambeaux was thrown upon the\r\nstreet, and a party of horsemen rode up; they were talking and laughing\r\ngaily. She heard one addressed as Count Fabian: she involuntarily drew\r\nback with instinctive hate; and then rushed forward and threw herself at\r\nhis horse\u2019s feet, exclaiming, \u201cSave my brother!\u201d The young cavalier\r\nreined up shortly his prancing steed, angrily reproving her for her\r\nheedlessness, and, without deigning another word, entered the courtyard.\r\nHe had not, perhaps, heard her prayer;\u2014he could not see the suppliant,\r\nhe spoke but in the impatience of the moment;\u2014but the poor child, deeply\r\nwounded by what had the appearance of a personal insult, turned proudly\r\nfrom the door, repressing the bitter tears that filled her eyes. Still\r\nshe walked on; but night took from her every chance of finding her way\r\nto the prison, and she resolved to return home, to engage one of the\r\nwomen of the house, of which she occupied a part, to accompany her. But\r\neven to find her way back became matter of difficulty; and she wandered\r\non, discovering no clue to guide her, and far too timid to address any\r\none she might chance to meet. Fatigue and personal fear were added to\r\nher other griefs, and tears streamed plentifully down her cheeks as she\r\ncontinued her hopeless journey! At length, at the corner of a street,\r\nshe recognised an image of the Madonna in a niche, with a lamp burning\r\nover it, familiar to her recollection as being near her home. With\r\ncharacteristic piety she knelt before it in thankfulness, and was\r\noffering a prayer for Lorenzo, when the sound of steps made her start\r\nup, and her brother\u2019s voice hailed, and her brother\u2019s arms encircled\r\nher; it seemed a miracle, but he was there, and all her fears were\r\nended.\r\n\r\nLorenzo anxiously asked whither she had been straying; her explanation\r\nwas soon given; and he in return related the misfortunes of the\r\nmorning\u2014the fate that impended over him, averted by the generous\r\nintercession of young Fabian himself; and yet\u2014he hesitated to unfold the\r\nbitter truth\u2014he was not freely pardoned\u2014he stood there a banished man,\r\ncondemned to die if the morrow\u2019s sun found him within the walls of\r\nSiena.\r\n\r\nThey had arrived, meanwhile, at their home; and with feminine care Flora\r\nplaced a simple repast before her brother, and then employed herself\r\nbusily in making various packages. Lorenzo paced the room, absorbed in\r\nthought; at length he stopped, and, kissing the fair girl, said,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere can I place thee in safety? how preserve thee, my flower of\r\nbeauty, while we are divided?\u201d\r\n\r\nFlora looked up fearfully. \u201cDo I not go with you?\u201d she asked; \u201cI was\r\nmaking preparations for our journey.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cImpossible, dearest; I go to privation and hardship.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I would share them with thee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may not be, sweet sister,\u201d replied Lorenzo, \u201cfate divides us, and we\r\nmust submit. I go to camps\u2014to the society of rude men; to struggle with\r\nsuch fortune as cannot harm me, but which for thee would be fraught with\r\nperil and despair. No, my Flora, I must provide safe and honourable\r\nguardianship for thee, even in this town.\u201d And again Lorenzo meditated\r\ndeeply on the part he should take, till suddenly a thought flashed on\r\nhis mind. \u201cIt is hazardous,\u201d he murmured, \u201cand yet I do him wrong to\r\ncall it so. Were our fates reversed, should I not think myself highly\r\nhonoured by such a trust?\u201d And then he told his sister to don hastily\r\nher best attire; to wrap her veil round her, and to come with him. She\r\nobeyed\u2014for obedience to her brother was the first and dearest of her\r\nduties. But she wept bitterly while her trembling fingers braided her\r\nlong hair, and she hastily changed her dress.\r\n\r\nAt length they walked forth again, and proceeded slowly, as Lorenzo\r\nemployed the precious minutes in consoling and counselling his sister.\r\nHe promised as speedy a return as he could accomplish; but if he failed\r\nto appear as soon as he could wish, yet he vowed solemnly that, if alive\r\nand free, she should see him within five years from the moment of\r\nparting. Should he not come before, he besought her earnestly to take\r\npatience, and to hope for the best till the expiration of that period;\r\nand made her promise not to bind herself by any vestal or matrimonial\r\nvow in the interim. They had arrived at their destination, and entered\r\nthe courtyard of a spacious palace. They met no servants; so crossed the\r\ncourt, and ascended the ample stairs. Flora had endeavoured to listen to\r\nher brother. He had bade her be of good cheer, and he was about to leave\r\nher; he told her to hope; and he spoke of an absence to endure five\r\nyears\u2014an endless term to her youthful anticipations. She promised\r\nobedience, but her voice was choked by sobs, and her tottering limbs\r\nwould not have supported her without his aid. She now perceived that\r\nthey were entering the lighted and inhabited rooms of a noble dwelling,\r\nand tried to restrain her tears, as she drew her veil closely around\r\nher. They passed from room to room, in which preparations for festivity\r\nwere making; the servants ushered them on, as if they had been invited\r\nguests, and conducted them into a hall filled with all the nobility and\r\nbeauty of Siena. Each eye turned with curiosity and wonder on the pair.\r\nLorenzo\u2019s tall person, and the lofty expression of his handsome\r\ncountenance, put the ladies in good-humour with him, while the cavaliers\r\ntried to peep under Flora\u2019s veil.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a mere child,\u201d they said, \u201cand a sorrowing one\u2014what can this\r\nmean?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe youthful master of the house, however, instantly recognised his\r\nuninvited and unexpected guest; but before he could ask the meaning of\r\nhis coming, Lorenzo had advanced with his sister to the spot where he\r\nstood, and addressed him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never thought, Count Fabian, to stand beneath your roof, and much\r\nless to approach you as a suitor. But that Supreme Power, to whose\r\ndecrees we must all bend, has reduced me to such adversity as, if it be\r\nHis will, may also visit you, notwithstanding the many friends that now\r\nsurround you, and the sunshine of prosperity in which you bask. I stand\r\nhere a banished man and a beggar. Nor do I repine at this my fate. Most\r\nwilling am I that my right arm alone should create my fortunes; and,\r\nwith the blessing of God, I hope so to direct my course, that we may yet\r\nmeet upon more equal terms. In this hope I turn my steps, not\r\nunwillingly, from this city; dear as its name is to my heart\u2014and dear\r\nthe associations which link its proud towers with the memory of my\r\nforefathers. I leave it a soldier of fortune; how I may return is\r\nwritten in the page where your unread destiny is traced as well as mine.\r\nBut my care ends not with myself. My dying father bequeathed to me this\r\nchild, my orphan sister, whom I have, until now, watched over with a\r\nparent\u2019s love. I should ill perform the part intrusted to me, were I to\r\ndrag this tender blossom from its native bower into the rude highways of\r\nlife. Lord Fabian, I can count no man my friend; for it would seem that\r\nyour smiles have won the hearts of my fellow-citizens from me; and death\r\nand exile have so dealt with my house, that not one of my name exists\r\nwithin the walls of Siena. To you alone can I intrust this precious\r\ncharge. Will you accept it until called upon to render it back to me,\r\nher brother, or to the juster hands of our Creator, pure and untarnished\r\nas I now deliver her to you? I ask you to protect her helplessness, to\r\nguard her honour; will you\u2014dare you accept a treasure, with the\r\nassurance of restoring it unsoiled, unhurt?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe deep expressive voice of the noble youth and his earnest eloquence\r\nenchained the ears of the whole assembly; and when he ceased, Fabian,\r\nproud of the appeal, and nothing loath in the buoyant spirit of youth to\r\nundertake a charge which, thus proffered before his assembled kinsmen\r\nand friends, became an honour, answered readily, \u201cI agree, and solemnly\r\nbefore Heaven accept your offer. I declare myself the guardian and\r\nprotector of your sister; she shall dwell in safety beneath my kind\r\nmother\u2019s care, and if the saints permit your return, she shall be\r\ndelivered back to you as spotless as she now is.\u201d\r\n\r\nLorenzo bowed his head; something choked his utterance as he thought\r\nthat he was about to part for ever from Flora; but he disdained to\r\nbetray this weakness before his enemies. He took his sister\u2019s hand and\r\ngazed upon her slight form with a look of earnest fondness, then\r\nmurmuring a blessing over her, and kissing her brow, he again saluted\r\nCount Fabian, and turning away with measured steps and lofty mien, left\r\nthe hall. Flora, scarcely understanding what had passed, stood trembling\r\nand weeping under her veil. She yielded her passive hand to Fabian, who,\r\nleading her to his mother, said: \u201cMadam, I ask of your goodness, and the\r\nmaternal indulgence you have ever shown, to assist me in fulfilling my\r\npromise, by taking under your gracious charge this young orphan.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou command here, my son,\u201d said the countess, \u201cand your will shall be\r\nobeyed.\u201d Then making a sign to one of her attendants, Flora was\r\nconducted from the hall, to where, in solitude and silence, she wept\r\nover her brother\u2019s departure, and her own strange position.\r\n\r\nFlora thus became an inmate of the dwelling of her ancestral foes, and\r\nthe ward of the most bitter enemy of her house. Lorenzo was gone she\r\nknew not whither, and her only pleasure consisted in reflecting that she\r\nwas obeying his behests. Her life was uniform and tranquil. Her\r\noccupation was working tapestry, in which she displayed taste and skill.\r\nSometimes she had the more mortifying task imposed on her of waiting on\r\nthe Countess de\u2019 Tolomei, who having lost two brothers in the last\r\ncontest with the Mancini, nourished a deep hatred towards the whole\r\nrace, and never smiled on the luckless orphan. Flora submitted to every\r\ncommand imposed upon her. She was buoyed up by the reflection that her\r\nsufferings wore imposed on her by Lorenzo; schooling herself in any\r\nmoment of impatience by the idea that thus she shared his adversity. No\r\nmurmur escaped her, though the pride and independence of her nature were\r\noften cruelly offended by the taunts and supercilious airs of her\r\npatroness or mistress, who was not a bad woman, but who thought it\r\nvirtue to ill-treat a Mancini. Often, indeed, she neither heard nor\r\nheeded these things. Her thoughts were far away, and grief for the loss\r\nof her brother\u2019s society weighed too heavily on her to allow her to\r\nspend more than a passing sigh on her personal injuries.\r\n\r\nThe countess was unkind and disdainful, but it was not thus with Flora\u2019s\r\ncompanions. They were amiable and affectionate girls, either of the\r\nbourgeois class, or daughters of dependants of the house of Tolomei. The\r\nlength of time which had elapsed since the overthrow of the Mancini, had\r\nerased from their young minds the bitter duty of hatred, and it was\r\nimpossible for them to live on terms of daily intercourse with the\r\norphan daughter of this ill-fated race, and not to become strongly\r\nattached to her. She was wholly devoid of selfishness, and content to\r\nperform her daily tasks in inoffensive silence. She had no envy, no wish\r\nto shine, no desire of pleasure. She was nevertheless ever ready to\r\nsympathize with her companions, and glad to have it in her power to\r\nadminister to their happiness. To help them in the manufacture of some\r\npiece of finery; to assist them in their work; and, perfectly prudent\r\nand reserved herself, to listen to all their sentimental adventures; to\r\ngive her best advice, and to aid them in any difficulty, were the simple\r\nmeans she used to win their unsophisticated hearts. They called her an\r\nangel; they looked up to her as to a saint, and in their hearts\r\nrespected her more than the countess herself.\r\n\r\nOne only subject ever disturbed Flora\u2019s serene melancholy. The praise\r\nshe perpetually heard lavished on Count Fabian, her brother\u2019s too\r\nsuccessful rival and oppressor, was an unendurable addition to her other\r\ngriefs. Content with her own obscurity, her ambition, her pride, her\r\naspiring thoughts were spent upon her brother. She hated Count Fabian as\r\nLorenzo\u2019s destroyer, and the cause of his unhappy exile. His\r\naccomplishments she despised as painted vanities; his person she\r\ncontemned as the opposite of his prototype. His blue eyes, clear and\r\nopen as day; his fair complexion and light brown hair; his slight\r\nelegant person; his voice, whose tones in song won each listener\u2019s heart\r\nto tenderness and love; his wit, his perpetual flow of spirits, and\r\nunalterable good-humour, were impertinences and frivolities to her who\r\ncherished with such dear worship the recollection of her serious,\r\nardent, noble-hearted brother, whose soul was ever set on high thoughts,\r\nand devoted to acts of virtue and self-sacrifice; whose fortitude and\r\naffectionate courtesy seemed to her the crown and glory of manhood; how\r\ndifferent from the trifling flippancy of Fabian! \u201cName an eagle,\u201d she\r\nwould say, \u201cand we raise our eyes to heaven, there to behold a creature\r\nfashioned in Nature\u2019s bounty; but it is a degradation to waste one\r\nthought on the insect of a day.\u201d Some speech similar to this had been\r\nkindly reported to the young count\u2019s lady mother, who idolized her son\r\nas the ornament and delight of his age and country. She severely\r\nreprimanded the incautious Flora, who, for the first time, listened\r\nproudly and unyieldingly. From this period her situation grew more\r\nirksome; all she could do was to endeavour to withdraw herself entirely\r\nfrom observation, and to brood over the perfections, while she lamented\r\nyet more keenly the absence, of her brother.\r\n\r\nTwo or three years thus flew away, and Flora grew from a\r\nchildish-looking girl of twelve into the bewitching beauty of fifteen.\r\nShe unclosed like a flower, whose fairest petals are yet shut, but whose\r\nhalf-veiled loveliness is yet more attractive. It was at this time that\r\non occasion of doing honour to a prince of France, who was passing on to\r\nNaples, the Countess Tolomei and her son, with a bevy of friends and\r\nfollowers, went out to meet and to escort the royal traveller on his\r\nway. Assembled in the hall of the palace, and waiting for the arrival of\r\nsome of their number, Count Fabian went round his mother\u2019s circle,\r\nsaying agreeable and merry things to all. Wherever his cheerful blue\r\neyes lighted, there smiles were awakened and each young heart beat with\r\nvanity at his harmless flatteries. After a gallant speech or two, he\r\nespied Flora, retired behind her companions.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat flower is this,\u201d he said, \u201cplaying at hide and seek with her\r\nbeauty?\u201d And then, struck by the modest sweetness of her aspect, her\r\neyes cast down, and a rosy blush mantling over her cheek, he added,\r\n\u201cWhat fair angel makes one of your company?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn angel indeed, my lord,\u201d exclaimed one of the younger girls, who\r\ndearly loved her best friend; \u201cshe is Flora Mancini.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMancini!\u201d exclaimed Fabian, while his manner became at once respectful\r\nand kind. \u201cAre you the orphan daughter of Ugo\u2014the sister of Lorenzo,\r\ncommitted by him to my care?\u201d For since then, through her careful\r\navoidance, Fabian had never even seen his fair ward. She bowed an assent\r\nto his questions, while her swelling heart denied her speech; and\r\nFabian, going up to his mother, said, \u201cMadam, I hope for our honour\u2019s\r\nsake that this has not before happened. The adverse fortune of this\r\nyoung lady may render retirement and obscurity befitting; but it is not\r\nfor us to turn into a menial one sprung from the best blood in Italy.\r\nLet me entreat you not to permit this to occur again. How shall I redeem\r\nmy pledged honour, or answer to her brother for this unworthy\r\ndegradation?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you have me make a friend and a companion of a Mancini?\u201d asked\r\nthe countess, with raised colour.\r\n\r\n\u201cI ask you not, mother, to do aught displeasing to you,\u201d replied the\r\nyoung noble; \u201cbut Flora is my ward, not our servant;\u2014permit her to\r\nretire; she will probably prefer the privacy of home, to making one\r\namong the festive crowd of her house\u2019s enemies. If not, let the choice\r\nbe hers\u2014Say, gentle one, will you go with us or retire?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe did not speak, but raising her soft eyes, curtsied to him and to his\r\nmother, and quitted the room; so, tacitly making her selection.\r\n\r\nFrom this time Flora never quitted the more secluded apartments of the\r\npalace, nor again saw Fabian. She was unaware that he had been profuse\r\nin his eulogium on her beauty; but that while frequently expressing his\r\ninterest in his ward, he rather avoided the dangerous power of her\r\nloveliness. She led rather a prison life, walking only in the palace\r\ngarden when it was else deserted, but otherwise her time was at her own\r\ndisposal, and no commands now interfered with her freedom. Her labours\r\nwere all spontaneous. The countess seldom even saw her, and she lived\r\namong this lady\u2019s attendants like a free boarder in a convent; who\r\ncannot quit the walls, but who is not subservient to the rules of the\r\nasylum. She was more busy than ever at her tapestry frame, because the\r\ncountess prized her work; and thus she could in some degree repay the\r\nprotection afforded her. She never mentioned Fabian, and always imposed\r\nsilence on her companions when they spoke of him. But she did this in no\r\ndisrespectful terms. \u201cHe is a generous enemy, I acknowledge,\u201d she would\r\nsay, \u201cbut still he is my enemy, and while through him my brother is an\r\nexile and a wanderer upon earth, it is painful to me to hear his name.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of many months spent in entire seclusion and\r\ntranquillity, a change occurred in the tenor of her life. The countess\r\nsuddenly resolved to pass the Easter festival at Rome. Flora\u2019s\r\ncompanions were wild with joy at the prospect of the journey, the\r\nnovelty, and the entertainment they promised themselves from this visit,\r\nand pitied the dignity of their friend, which prevented her from making\r\none in their mistress\u2019s train; for it was soon understood that Flora was\r\nto be left behind; and she was informed that the interval of the lady\u2019s\r\nabsence was to be passed by her in a villa belonging to the family\r\nsituated in a sequestered nook among the neighbouring Apennines.\r\n\r\nThe countess departed in pomp and pride on her so-called pilgrimage to\r\nthe sacred city, and at the same time Flora was conveyed to her rural\r\nretreat. The villa was inhabited only by the peasant and his family, who\r\ncultivated the farm, or podere, attached to it, and the old cassi\u00e9re or\r\nhousekeeper. The cheerfulness and freedom of the country were\r\ndelightful, and the entire solitude consonant to the habits of the\r\nmeditative girl, accustomed to the confinement of the city, and the\r\nintrusive prattle of her associates. Spring was opening with all the\r\nbeauty which that season showers upon favoured Italy. The almond and\r\npeach trees were in blossom; and the vine-dresser sang at his work,\r\nperched with his pruning-knife among the vines. Blossoms and flowers, in\r\nlaughing plenty, graced the soil; and the trees, swelling with buds\r\nready to expand into leaves, seemed to feel the life that animated their\r\ndark old boughs. Flora was enchanted; the country labours interested\r\nher, and the hoarded experience of old Sandra was a treasure-house of\r\nwisdom and amusement. Her attention had hitherto been directed to giving\r\nthe most vivid hues and truest imitation to her transcript with her\r\nneedle of some picture given her as a model; but here was a novel\r\noccupation. She learned the history of the bees, watched the habits of\r\nthe birds, and inquired into the culture of plants. Sandra was delighted\r\nwith her new companion; and, though notorious for being cross, yet could\r\nwriggle her antique lips into smiles for Flora.\r\n\r\nTo repay the kindness of her guardian and his mother, she still devoted\r\nmuch time to her needle. This occupation but engaged half her attention;\r\nand while she pursued it, she could give herself up to endless reverie\r\non the subject of Lorenzo\u2019s fortunes. Three years had flown since he had\r\nleft her; and, except a little gold cross brought to her by a pilgrim\r\nfrom Milan, but one month after his departure, she had received no\r\ntidings of him. Whether from Milan he had proceeded to France, Germany,\r\nor the Holy Land, she did not know. By turns her fancy led him to either\r\nof these places, and fashioned the course of events that might have\r\nbefallen him. She figured to herself his toilsome journeys\u2014his life in\r\nthe camp\u2014his achievements, and the honours showered on him by kings and\r\nnobles; her cheek glowed at the praises he received, and her eye kindled\r\nwith delight as it imaged him standing with modest pride and an erect\r\nbut gentle mien before them. Then the fair enthusiast paused; it crossed\r\nher recollection like a shadow, that if all had gone prosperously, he\r\nhad returned to share his prosperity with her, and her faltering heart\r\nturned to sadder scenes to account for his protracted absence.\r\n\r\nSometimes, while thus employed, she brought her work into the trellised\r\narbour of the garden, or, when it was too warm for the open air, she had\r\na favourite shady window, which looked down a deep ravine into a\r\nmajestic wood, whence the sound of falling water met her ears. One day,\r\nwhile she employed her fingers upon the spirited likeness of a hound\r\nwhich made a part of the hunting-piece she was working for the countess,\r\na sharp, wailing cry suddenly broke on her ear, followed by trampling of\r\nhorses and the hurried steps and loud vociferations of men. They entered\r\nthe villa on the opposite side from that which her window commanded;\r\nbut, the noise continuing, she rose to ask the reason, when Sandra burst\r\ninto the room, crying, \u201cO Madonna! he is dead! he has been thrown from\r\nhis horse, and he will never speak more.\u201d Flora for an instant could\r\nonly think of her brother. She rushed past the old woman, down into the\r\ngreat hall, in which, lying on a rude litter of boughs, she beheld the\r\ninanimate body of Count Fabian. He was surrounded by servitors and\r\npeasants, who were all clasping their hands and tearing their hair as,\r\nwith frightful shrieks, they pressed round their lord, not one of them\r\nendeavouring to restore him to life. Flora\u2019s first impulse was to\r\nretire; but, casting a second glance on the livid brow of the young\r\ncount, she saw his eyelids move, and the blood falling in quick drops\r\nfrom his hair on the pavement. She exclaimed, \u201cHe is not dead\u2014he bleeds!\r\nhasten some of you for a leech!\u201d And meanwhile she hurried to get some\r\nwater, sprinkled it on his face, and, dispersing the group that hung\r\nover him and impeded the free air, the soft breeze playing on his\r\nforehead revived him, and he gave manifest tokens of life; so that when\r\nthe physician arrived, he found that, though he was seriously and even\r\ndangerously hurt, every hope might be entertained of his recovery.\r\n\r\nFlora undertook the office of his nurse, and fulfilled its duties with\r\nunwearied attention. She watched him by night and waited on him by day\r\nwith that spirit of Christian humility and benevolence which animates a\r\nSister of Charity as she tends the sick. For several days Fabian\u2019s soul\r\nseemed on the wing to quit its earthly abode; and the state of weakness\r\nthat followed his insensibility was scarcely less alarming. At length,\r\nhe recognised and acknowledged the care of Flora, but she alone\r\npossessed any power to calm and guide him during the state of\r\nirritability and fever that then ensued. Nothing except her presence\r\ncontrolled his impatience; before her he was so lamb-like, that she\r\ncould scarcely have credited the accounts that others gave her of his\r\nviolence, but that, whenever she returned, after leaving him for any\r\ntime, she heard his voice far off in anger, and found him with flushed\r\ncheeks and flashing eyes, all which demonstrations subsided into meek\r\nacquiescence when she drew near.\r\n\r\nIn a few weeks he was able to quit his room; but any noise or sudden\r\nsound drove him almost insane. So loud is an Italian\u2019s quietest\r\nmovements, that Flora was obliged to prevent the approach of any except\r\nherself; and her soft voice and noiseless footfall were the sweetest\r\nmedicine she could administer to her patient. It was painful to her to\r\nbe in perpetual attendance on Lorenzo\u2019s rival and foe, but she subdued\r\nher heart to her duty, and custom helped to reconcile her. As he grew\r\nbetter, she could not help remarking the intelligence of his\r\ncountenance, and the kindness and cordiality of his manners. There was\r\nan unobtrusive and delicate attention and care in his intercourse with\r\nher that won her to be pleased. When he conversed, his discourse was\r\nfull of entertainment and variety. His memory was well-stored with\r\nnumerous _fabliaux_, _novelle_, and romances, which he quickly\r\ndiscovered to be highly interesting to her, and so contrived to have one\r\nalways ready from the exhaustless stock he possessed. These romantic\r\nstories reminded her of the imaginary adventures she had invented, in\r\nsolitude and silence, for her brother; and each tale of foreign\r\ncountries had a peculiar charm, which animated her face as she listened,\r\nso that Fabian could have gone on for ever, only to mark the varying\r\nexpression of her countenance as he proceeded. Yet she acknowledged\r\nthese attractions in him as a Catholic nun may the specious virtues of a\r\nheretic; and, while he contrived each day to increase the pleasure she\r\nderived from his society, she satisfied her conscience with regard to\r\nher brother by cherishing in secret a little quiet stock of family hate,\r\nand by throwing over her manners, whenever she could recollect so to do,\r\na cold and ceremonious tone, which she had the pleasure of seeing vexed\r\nhim heartily.\r\n\r\nNearly two months had passed, and he was so well recovered that Flora\r\nbegan to wonder that he did not return to Siena, and of course to fulfil\r\nher duty by wishing that he should; and yet, while his cheek was sunk\r\nthrough past sickness, and his elastic step grown slow, she, as a nurse\r\ndesirous of completing her good work, felt averse to his entering too\r\nsoon on the scene of the busy town and its noisy pleasures. At length,\r\ntwo or three of his friends having come to see him, he agreed to return\r\nwith them to the city. A significant glance which they cast on his young\r\nnurse probably determined him. He parted from her with a grave courtesy\r\nand a profusion of thanks, unlike his usual manner, and rode off without\r\nalluding to any probability of their meeting again.\r\n\r\nShe fancied that she was relieved from a burden when he went, and was\r\nsurprised to find the days grow tedious, and mortified to perceive that\r\nher thoughts no longer spent themselves so spontaneously on her brother,\r\nand to feel that the occupation of a few weeks could unhinge her mind\r\nand dissipate her cherished reveries; thus, while she felt the absence\r\nof Fabian, she was annoyed at him the more for having, in addition to\r\nhis other misdeeds, invaded the sanctuary of her dearest thoughts. She\r\nwas beginning to conquer this listlessness, and to return with renewed\r\nzest to her usual occupations, when, in about a week after his\r\ndeparture, Fabian suddenly returned. He came upon her as she was\r\ngathering flowers for the shrine of the Madonna; and, on seeing him, she\r\nblushed as rosy red as the roses she held. He looked infinitely worse in\r\nhealth than when he went. His wan cheeks and sunk eyes excited her\r\nconcern; and her earnest and kind questions somewhat revived him. He\r\nkissed her hand, and continued to stand beside her as she finished her\r\nnosegay. Had any one seen the glad, fond look with which he regarded her\r\nas she busied herself among the flowers, even old Sandra might have\r\nprognosticated his entire recovery under her care.\r\n\r\nFlora was totally unaware of the feelings that were excited in Fabian\u2019s\r\nheart, and the struggle he made to overcome a passion too sweet and too\r\nseductive, when awakened by so lovely a being, ever to be subdued. He\r\nhad been struck with her some time ago, and avoided her. It was through\r\nhis suggestion that she passed the period of the countess\u2019s pilgrimage\r\nin this secluded villa. Nor had he thought of visiting her there; but,\r\nriding over one day to inquire concerning a foal rearing for him, his\r\nhorse had thrown him, and caused him that injury which had made him so\r\nlong the inmate of the same abode. Already prepared to admire her\u2014her\r\nkindness, her gentleness, and her unwearied patience during his illness,\r\neasily conquered a heart most ready and yet most unwilling to yield. He\r\nhad returned to Siena resolved to forget her, but he came back assured\r\nthat his life and death were in her hands.\r\n\r\nAt first Count Fabian had forgot that he had any but his own feelings\r\nand prejudices, and those of his mother and kindred, to overcome; but\r\nwhen the tyranny of love vanquished these, he began to fear a more\r\ninsurmountable impediment in Flora. The first whisper of love fell like\r\nmortal sin upon her ear; and disturbed, and even angry, she replied:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMethinks you wholly forget who I am, and what you are. I speak not of\r\nancient feuds, though these were enough to divide us for ever. Know that\r\nI hate you as my brother\u2019s oppressor. Restore Lorenzo to me\u2014recall him\r\nfrom banishment\u2014erase the memory of all that he has suffered through\r\nyou\u2014win his love and approbation;\u2014and when all this is fulfilled, which\r\nnever can be, speak a language which now it is as the bitterness of\r\ndeath for me to hear!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd saying this, she hastily retired, to conceal the floods of tears\r\nwhich this, as she termed it, insult had caused to flow; to lament yet\r\nmore deeply her brother\u2019s absence and her own dependence.\r\n\r\nFabian was not so easily silenced; and Flora had no wish to renew scenes\r\nand expressions of violence so foreign to her nature. She imposed a rule\r\non herself, by never swerving from which she hoped to destroy the\r\nill-omened love of her protector. She secluded herself as much as\r\npossible; and when with him assumed a chilling indifference of manner,\r\nand made apparent in her silence so absolute and cold a rejection of all\r\nhis persuasions, that had not love with its unvanquishable hopes reigned\r\nabsolutely in young Fabian\u2019s heart, he must have despaired. He ceased to\r\nspeak of his affection, so to win back her ancient kindness. This was at\r\nfirst difficult; for she was timid as a young bird, whose feet have\r\ntouched the limed twigs. But naturally credulous, and quite\r\ninexperienced, she soon began to believe that her alarm was exaggerated,\r\nand to resume those habits of intimacy which had heretofore subsisted\r\nbetween them. By degrees Fabian contrived to insinuate the existence of\r\nhis attachment\u2014he could not help it. He asked no return; he would wait\r\nfor Lorenzo\u2019s arrival, which he was sure could not be far distant. Her\r\ndispleasure could not change, nor silence destroy, a sentiment which\r\nsurvived in spite of both. Intrenched in her coldness and her\r\nindifference, she hoped to weary him out by her defensive warfare, and\r\nfancied that he would soon cease his pursuit in disgust.\r\n\r\nThe countess had been long away; she had proceeded to view the feast of\r\nSan Gennaro at Naples, and had not received tidings of her son\u2019s\r\nillness. Her return was now expected; and Fabian resolved to return to\r\nSiena in time to receive her. Both he and Flora were therefore surprised\r\none day, when she suddenly entered the apartment where they both were.\r\nFlora had long peremptorily insisted that he should not intrude while\r\nshe was employed on her embroidery frame; but this day he had made so\r\ngood a pretext, that for the first time he was admitted, and then\r\nsuffered to stay a few minutes\u2014they now neither of them knew how long;\r\nshe was busy at her work; and he sitting near, gazing unreproved on her\r\nunconscious face and graceful figure, felt himself happier than he had\r\never been before.\r\n\r\nThe countess was sufficiently surprised, and not a little angry; but\r\nbefore she could do more than utter one exclamation, Fabian interrupted,\r\nby entreating her not to spoil all. He drew her away; he made his own\r\nexplanations, and urged his wishes with resistless persuasion. The\r\ncountess had been used to indulge him in every wish; it was impossible\r\nfor her to deny any strongly urged request; his pertinacity, his\r\nagitation, his entreaties half won her; and the account of his illness,\r\nand his assurances, seconded by those of all the family, that Flora had\r\nsaved his life, completed the conquest, and she became in her turn a\r\nsuitor for her son to the orphan daughter of Mancini.\r\n\r\nFlora, educated till the age of twelve by one who never consulted his\r\nown pleasures and gratifications, but went right on in the path of duty,\r\nregardless of pain or disappointment, had no idea of doing aught merely\r\nbecause she or others might wish it. Since that time she had been thrown\r\non her own resources; and jealously cherishing her individuality, every\r\nfeeling of her heart had been strengthened by solitude and by a sense of\r\nmental independence. She was the least likely of any one to go with the\r\nstream, or to yield to the mere influence of circumstances. She felt,\r\nshe knew, what it became her to do, and that must be done in spite of\r\nevery argument.\r\n\r\nThe countess\u2019s expostulations and entreaties were of no avail. The\r\npromise she had made to her brother of engaging herself by no vow for\r\nfive years must be observed under every event; it was asked from her at\r\nthe sad and solemn hour of their parting, and was thus rendered doubly\r\nsacred. So constituted, indeed, were her feelings, that the slightest\r\nwish she ever remembered having been expressed by Lorenzo had more\r\nweight with her than the most urgent prayers of another. He was a part\r\nof her religion; reverence and love for him had been moulded into the\r\nsubstance of her soul from infancy; their very separation had tended to\r\nrender these impressions irradicable. She brooded over them for years;\r\nand when no sympathy or generous kindness was afforded her\u2014when the\r\ncountess treated her like an inferior and a dependant, and Fabian had\r\nforgotten her existence, she had lived from month to month, and from\r\nyear to year, cherishing the image of her brother, and only able to\r\ntolerate the annoyances that beset her existence, by considering that\r\nher patience, her fortitude, and her obedience were all offerings at the\r\nshrine of her beloved Lorenzo\u2019s desires.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the generous and kindly disposition of Fabian won her to\r\nregard him with a feeling nearly approaching tenderness, though this\r\nemotion was feeble, the mere ripple of the waves, compared to the mighty\r\ntide of affection that set her will all one way, and made her deem\r\neverything trivial except Lorenzo\u2019s return\u2014Lorenzo\u2019s existence\u2014obedience\r\nto Lorenzo. She listened to her lover\u2019s persuasions so unyieldingly that\r\nthe countess was provoked by her inflexibility; but she bore her\r\nreproaches with such mildness, and smiled so sweetly, that Fabian was\r\nthe more charmed. She admitted that she owed him a certain submission as\r\nthe guardian set over her by her brother; Fabian would have gladly\r\nexchanged this authority for the pleasure of being commanded by her; but\r\nthis was an honour he could not attain, so in playful spite he enforced\r\nconcessions from her. At his desire she appeared in society, dressed as\r\nbecame her rank, and filled in his house the station a sister of his own\r\nwould have held. She preferred seclusion, but she was averse to\r\ncontention, and it was little that she yielded, while the purpose of her\r\nsoul was as fixed as ever.\r\n\r\nThe fifth year of Lorenzo\u2019s exile was now drawing to a close, but he did\r\nnot return, nor had any intelligence been received of him. The decree of\r\nhis banishment had been repealed, the fortunes of his house restored,\r\nand his palace, under Fabian\u2019s generous care, rebuilt. These were acts\r\nthat demanded and excited Flora\u2019s gratitude; yet they were performed in\r\nan unpretending manner, as if the citizens of Siena had suddenly become\r\njust and wise without his interference. But these things dwindled into\r\ntrifles while the continuation of Lorenzo\u2019s absence seemed the pledge of\r\nher eternal misery; and the tacit appeal made to her kindness, while she\r\nhad no thought but for her brother, drove her to desperation. She could\r\nno longer tolerate the painful anomaly of her situation; she could not\r\nendure her suspense for her brother\u2019s fate, nor the reproachful glances\r\nof Fabian\u2019s mother and his friends. He himself was more generous,\u2014he\r\nread her heart, and, as the termination of the fifth year drew nigh,\r\nceased to allude to his own feelings, and appeared as wrapt as herself\r\nin doubt concerning the fate of the noble youth, whom they could\r\nscarcely entertain a hope of ever seeing more. This was small comfort to\r\nFlora. She had resolved that when the completion of the fifth year\r\nassured her that her brother was for ever lost, she would never see\r\nFabian again. At first she had resolved to take refuge in a convent, and\r\nin the sanctity of religious vows. But she remembered how averse Lorenzo\r\nhad always shown himself to this vocation, and that he had preferred to\r\nplace her beneath the roof of his foe, than within the walls of a\r\nnunnery. Besides, young as she was, and, despite of herself, full of\r\nhope, she recoiled from shutting the gates of life upon herself for\r\never. Notwithstanding her fears and sorrow, she clung to the belief that\r\nLorenzo lived; and this led her to another plan. When she had received\r\nher little cross from Milan, it was accompanied by a message that he\r\nbelieved he had found a good friend in the archbishop of that place.\r\nThis prelate, therefore, would know whither Lorenzo had first bent his\r\nsteps, and to him she resolved to apply. Her scheme was easily formed.\r\nShe possessed herself of the garb of a pilgrim, and resolved on the day\r\nfollowing the completion of the fifth year to depart from Siena, and\r\nbend her steps towards Lombardy, buoyed up by the hope that she should\r\ngain some tidings of her brother.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Fabian had formed a similar resolve. He had learnt the fact\r\nfrom Flora, of Lorenzo having first resorted to Milan, and he determined\r\nto visit that city, and not to return without certain information. He\r\nacquainted his mother with his plan, but begged her not to inform Flora,\r\nthat she might not be tortured by double doubt during his absence.\r\n\r\nThe anniversary of the fifth year was come, and with it the eve of these\r\nseveral and separate journeys. Flora had retired to spend the day at the\r\nvilla before mentioned. She had chosen to retire thither for various\r\nreasons. Her escape was more practicable thence than in the town; and\r\nshe was anxious to avoid seeing both Fabian and his mother, now that she\r\nwas on the point of inflicting severe pain on them. She spent the day at\r\nthe villa and in its gardens, musing on her plans, regretting the quiet\r\nof her past life\u2014saddened on Fabian\u2019s account\u2014grieving bitterly for\r\nLorenzo. She was not alone, for she had been obliged to confide in one\r\nof her former companions, and to obtain her assistance. Poor little\r\nAngeline was dreadfully frightened with the trust reposed in her, but\r\ndid not dare expostulate with or betray her friend; and she continued\r\nnear her during this last day, by turns trying to console and weeping\r\nwith her. Towards evening they wandered together into the wood\r\ncontiguous to the villa. Flora had taken her harp with her, but her\r\ntrembling fingers refused to strike its chords; she left it, she left\r\nher companion, and strayed on alone to take leave of a spot consecrated\r\nby many a former visit. Here the umbrageous trees gathered about her,\r\nand shaded her with their thick and drooping foliage;\u2014a torrent dashed\r\ndown from neighbouring rock, and fell from a height into a rustic basin,\r\nhollowed to receive it; then, overflowing the margin at one spot, it\r\ncontinued falling over successive declivities, till it reached the\r\nbottom of a little ravine, when it stole on in a placid and silent\r\ncourse. This had ever been a favourite resort of Flora. The twilight of\r\nthe wood and the perpetual flow, the thunder, the hurry, and the turmoil\r\nof the waters, the varied sameness of the eternal elements, accorded\r\nwith the melancholy of her ideas, and the endless succession of her\r\nreveries. She came to it now; she gazed on the limpid cascade\u2014for the\r\nlast time; a soft sadness glistened in her eyes, and her attitude\r\ndenoted the tender regret that filled her bosom; her long bright tresses\r\nstreaming in elegant disorder, her light veil and simple, yet rich,\r\nattire, were fitfully mirrored in the smooth face of the rushing waters.\r\nAt this moment the sound of steps more firm and manly than those of\r\nAngeline struck her ear, and Fabian himself stood before her; he was\r\nunable to bring himself to depart on his journey without seeing her once\r\nagain. He had ridden to the villa, and, finding that she had quitted it,\r\nsought and found her in the lone recess where they had often spent hours\r\ntogether which had been full of bliss to him. Flora was sorry to see\r\nhim, for her secret was on her lips, and yet she resolved not to give it\r\nutterance. He was ruled by the same feeling. Their interview was\r\ntherefore short, and neither alluded to what sat nearest the heart of\r\neach. They parted with a simple \u201cGood-night,\u201d as if certain of meeting\r\nthe following morning; each deceived the other, and each was in turn\r\ndeceived. There was more of tenderness in Flora\u2019s manner than there had\r\never been; it cheered his faltering soul, about to quit her, while the\r\nanticipation of the blow he was about to receive from her made her\r\nregard as venial this momentary softening towards her brother\u2019s enemy.\r\n\r\nFabian passed the night at the villa, and early the next morning he\r\ndeparted for Milan. He was impatient to arrive at the end of his\r\njourney, and often he thrust his spurs into his horse\u2019s sides, and put\r\nhim to his speed, which even then appeared slow. Yet he was aware that\r\nhis arrival at Milan might advance him not a jot towards the ultimate\r\nobject of his journey; and he called Flora cruel and unkind, until the\r\nrecollection of her kind farewell consoled and cheered him.\r\n\r\nHe stopped the first night at Empoli, and, crossing the Arno, began to\r\nascend the Apennines on the northern side. Soon he penetrated their\r\nfastnesses, and entered deep into the ilex woods. He journeyed on\r\nperseveringly, and yet the obstructions he met with were many, and borne\r\nwith impatience. At length, on the afternoon of the third day, he\r\narrived at a little rustic inn, hid deep in a wood, which showed signs\r\nof seldom being visited by travellers. The burning sun made it a welcome\r\nshelter for Fabian; and he deposited his steed in the stable, which he\r\nfound already partly occupied by a handsome black horse, and then\r\nentered the inn to seek refreshment for himself. There seemed some\r\ndifficulty in obtaining this. The landlady was the sole domestic, and it\r\nwas long before she made her appearance, and then she was full of\r\ntrouble and dismay; a sick traveller had arrived\u2014a gentleman to all\r\nappearance dying of a malignant fever. His horse, his well-stored purse,\r\nand rich dress showed that he was a cavalier of consequence;\u2014the more\r\nthe pity. There was no help, nor any means of carrying him forward; yet\r\nhalf his pain seemed to arise from his regret at being detained\u2014he was\r\nso eager to proceed to Siena. The name of his own town excited the\r\ninterest of Count Fabian, and he went up to visit the stranger, while\r\nthe hostess prepared his repast.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Flora awoke with the lark, and with the assistance of Angeline\r\nattired herself in her pilgrim\u2019s garb. From the stir below, she was\r\nsurprised to find that Count Fabian had passed the night at the villa,\r\nand she lingered till he should have departed, as she believed, on his\r\nreturn to Siena. Then she embraced her young friend, and taking leave of\r\nher with many blessings and thanks, alone, with Heaven, as she trusted,\r\nfor her guide, she quitted Fabian\u2019s sheltering roof, and with a heart\r\nthat maintained its purpose in spite of her feminine timidity, began her\r\npilgrimage. Her journey performed on foot was slow, so that there was no\r\nlikelihood that she could overtake her lover, already many miles in\r\nadvance. Now that she had begun it, her undertaking appeared to her\r\ngigantic, and her heart almost failed her. The burning sun scorched her;\r\nnever having before found herself alone in a highway, a thousand fears\r\nassailed her, and she grew so weary, that soon she was unable to support\r\nherself. By the advice of a landlady at an inn where she stopped, she\r\npurchased a mule to help her on her long journey. Yet with this help it\r\nwas the third night before she arrived at Empoli, and then crossing the\r\nArno, as her lover had done before, her difficulties seemed to begin to\r\nunfold themselves, and to grow gigantic, as she entered the dark woods\r\nof the Apennines, and found herself amidst the solitude of its vast\r\nforests. Her pilgrim\u2019s garb inspired some respect, and she rested at\r\nconvents by the way. The pious sisters held up their hands in admiration\r\nof her courage; while her heart beat faintly with the knowledge that she\r\npossessed absolutely none. Yet, again and again, she repeated to\r\nherself, that the Apennines once passed, the worst would be over. So she\r\ntoiled on, now weary, now frightened\u2014very slowly, and yet very anxious\r\nto get on with speed.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the seventh day after quitting her home, she was still\r\nentangled in the mazes of these savage hills. She was to sleep at a\r\nconvent on their summit that night, and the next day arrive at Bologna.\r\nThis hope had cheered her through the day; but evening approached, the\r\nway grew more intricate, and no convent appeared. The sun had set, and\r\nshe listened anxiously for the bell of the Ave Maria, which would give\r\nher hope that the goal she sought was nigh; but all was silent, save the\r\nswinging boughs of the vast trees, and the timid beating of her own\r\nheart; darkness closed around her, and despair came with the increased\r\nobscurity, till a twinkling light, revealing itself among the trees,\r\nafforded her some relief. She followed this beamy guide till it led her\r\nto a little inn, where the sight of a kind-looking woman, and the\r\nassurance of safe shelter, dispelled her terrors, and filled her with\r\ngrateful pleasure.\r\n\r\nSeeing her so weary, the considerate hostess hastened to place food\r\nbefore her, and then conducted her to a little low room where her bed\r\nwas prepared. \u201cI am sorry, lady,\u201d said the landlady in a whisper, \u201cnot\r\nto be able to accommodate you better; but a sick cavalier occupies my\r\nbest room\u2014it is next to this\u2014and he sleeps now, and I would not disturb\r\nhim. Poor gentleman! I never thought he would rise more; and under\r\nHeaven he owes his life to one who, whether he is related to him or not\r\nI cannot tell, for he did not accompany him. Four days ago he stopped\r\nhere, and I told him my sorrow\u2014how I had a dying guest, and he\r\ncharitably saw him, and has since then nursed him more like a\r\ntwin-brother than a stranger.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe good woman prattled on. Flora heard but little of what she said; and\r\novercome by weariness and sleep, paid no attention to her tale. But\r\nhaving performed her orisons, and placed her head on the pillow, she was\r\nquickly lapped in the balmy slumber she so much needed.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning she was awoke by a murmur of voices in the next\r\nroom. She started up, and recalling her scattered thoughts, tried to\r\nremember the account the hostess had given her the preceding evening.\r\nThe sick man spoke, but his accent was low, and the words did not reach\r\nher;\u2014he was answered\u2014could Flora believe her senses? did she not know\r\nthe voice that spoke these words?\u2014\u201cFear nothing, a sweet sleep has done\r\nyou infinite good; and I rejoice in the belief that you will speedily\r\nrecover. I have sent to Siena for your sister, and do indeed expect that\r\nFlora will arrive this very day.\u201d\r\n\r\nMore was said, but Flora heard no more; she had risen, and was hastily\r\ndressing herself; in a few minutes she was by her brother\u2019s, her\r\nLorenzo\u2019s bedside, kissing his wan hand, and assuring him that she was\r\nindeed Flora.\r\n\r\n\u201cThese are indeed wonders,\u201d he at last said; \u201cand if you are mine own\r\nFlora you perhaps can tell me who this noble gentleman is, who day and\r\nnight has watched beside me, as a mother may by her only child, giving\r\nno time to repose, but exhausting himself for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow, dearest brother,\u201d said Flora, \u201ccan I truly answer your question?\r\nto mention the name of our benefactor were to speak of a mask and a\r\ndisguise, not a true thing. He is my protector and guardian, who has\r\nwatched over and preserved me while you wandered far; his is the most\r\ngenerous heart in Italy, offering past enmity and family pride as\r\nsacrifices at the altar of nobleness and truth. He is the restorer of\r\nyour fortunes in your native town\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the lover of my sweet sister.\u2014I have heard of these things, and was\r\non my way to confirm his happiness and to find my own, when sickness\r\nlaid me thus low, and would have destroyed us both for ever, but for\r\nFabian Tolomei\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWho how exerts his expiring authority to put an end to this scene,\u201d\r\ninterrupted the young count. \u201cNot till this day has Lorenzo been\r\nsufficiently composed to hear any of these explanations, and we risk his\r\nreturning health by too long a conversation. The history of these things\r\nand of his long wanderings, now so happily ended, must be reserved for a\r\nfuture hour; when assembled in our beloved Siena, exiles and foes no\r\nlonger, we shall long enjoy the happiness which Providence, after so\r\nmany trials, has bounteously reserved for us.\u201d\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XIII.\r\n\r\n                            _THE PARVENUE._\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY do I write my melancholy story? Is it as a lesson, to prevent any\r\nother from wishing to rise to rank superior to that in which they are\r\nborn? No! miserable as I am, others might have been happy, I doubt not,\r\nin my position: the chalice has been poisoned for me alone! Am I\r\nevil-minded\u2014am I wicked? What have been my errors, that I am now an\r\noutcast and wretched? I will tell my story\u2014let others judge me; my mind\r\nis bewildered, I cannot judge myself.\r\n\r\nMy father was land steward to a wealthy nobleman. He married young, and\r\nhad several children. He then lost his wife, and remained fifteen years\r\na widower, when he married again a young girl, the daughter of a\r\nclergyman, who died, leaving a numerous offspring in extreme poverty. My\r\nmaternal grandfather had been a man of sensibility and genius; my mother\r\ninherited many of his endowments. She was an angel on earth; all her\r\nworks were charity, all her thoughts were love.\r\n\r\nWithin a year after her marriage, she gave birth to twins\u2014I and my\r\nsister; soon after she fell into ill-health, and from that time was\r\nalways weakly. She could endure no fatigue, and seldom moved from her\r\nchair. I see her now;\u2014her white, delicate hands employed in needlework,\r\nher soft, love-lighted eyes fixed on me. I was still a child when my\r\nfather fell into trouble, and we removed from the part of the country\r\nwhere we had hitherto lived, and went to a distant village, where we\r\nrented a cottage, with a little land adjoining. We were poor, and all\r\nthe family assisted each other. My elder half-sisters were strong,\r\nindustrious, rustic young women, and submitted to a life of labour with\r\ngreat cheerfulness. My father held the plough, my half-brothers worked\r\nin the barns; all was toil, yet all seemed enjoyment.\r\n\r\nHow happy my childhood was! Hand in hand with my dear twin-sister, I\r\nplucked the spring flowers in the hedges, turned the hay in the summer\r\nmeadows, shook the apples from the trees in the autumn, and at all\r\nseasons, gambolled in delicious liberty beneath the free air of heaven;\r\nor at my mother\u2019s feet, caressed by her, I was taught the sweetest\r\nlessons of charity and love. My elder sisters were kind; we were all\r\nlinked by strong affection. The delicate, fragile existence of my mother\r\ngave an interest to our monotony, while her virtues and her refinement\r\nthrew a grace over our homely household.\r\n\r\nI and my sister did not seem twins, we were so unlike. She was robust,\r\nchubby, full of life and spirits; I, tall, slim, fair, and even pale. I\r\nloved to play with her, but soon grew tired, and then I crept to my\r\nmother\u2019s side, and she sang me to sleep, and nursed me in her bosom, and\r\nlooked on me with her own angelic smile. She took pains to instruct me,\r\nnot in accomplishments, but in all real knowledge. She unfolded to me\r\nthe wonders of the visible creation, and to each tale of bird and beast,\r\nof fiery mountain or vast river, was appended some moral, derived from\r\nher warm heart and ardent imagination. Above all, she impressed upon me\r\nthe precepts of the gospel, charity to every fellow-creature, the\r\nbrotherhood of mankind, the rights that every sentient creature\r\npossesses to our services. I was her almoner; for, poor as she was, she\r\nwas the benefactress of those who were poorer. Being delicate, I helped\r\nher in her task of needlework, while my sister aided the rest in their\r\nhousehold or rustic labours.\r\n\r\nWhen I was seventeen, a miserable accident happened. A hayrick caught\r\nfire; it communicated to our outhouses, and at last to the cottage. We\r\nwere roused from our beds at midnight, and escaped barely with our\r\nlives. My father bore out my mother in his arms, and then tried to save\r\na portion of his property. The roof of the cottage fell in on him. He\r\nwas dug out after an hour, scorched, maimed, crippled for life.\r\n\r\nWe were all saved, but by a miracle only was I preserved. I and my\r\nsister were awoke by cries of fire. The cottage was already enveloped in\r\nflames. Susan, with her accustomed intrepidity, rushed through the\r\nflames, and escaped; I thought only of my mother, and hurried to her\r\nroom. The fire raged around me; it encircled\u2014hemmed me in. I believed\r\nthat I must die, when suddenly I felt myself seized upon and borne away.\r\nI looked on my preserver\u2014it was Lord Reginald Desborough.\r\n\r\nFor many Sundays past, when, at church, I knew that Lord Reginald\u2019s eyes\r\nwere fixed on me. He had met me and Susan in our walks; he had called at\r\nour cottage. There was fascination in his eye, in his soft voice and\r\nearnest gaze, and my heart throbbed with gladness, as I thought that he\r\nsurely loved me. To have been saved by him was to make the boon of life\r\ndoubly precious.\r\n\r\nThere is to me much obscurity in this part of my story. Lord Reginald\r\nloved me, it is true; why he loved me, so far as to forget pride of rank\r\nand ambition for my sake, he who afterwards showed no tendency to\r\ndisregard the prejudices and habits of rank and wealth, I cannot tell;\r\nit seems strange. He had loved me before, but from the hour that he\r\nsaved my life, love grew into an overpowering passion. He offered us a\r\nlodge on his estate to take refuge in; and while there, he sent us\r\npresents of game, and still more kindly, fruits and flowers to my\r\nmother, and came himself, especially, when all were out except my mother\r\nand myself, and sat by us and conversed. Soon I learnt to expect the\r\nsoft-asking look of his eyes, and almost dared answer it. My mother once\r\nperceived these glances, and took an opportunity to appeal to Lord\r\nReginald\u2019s good feelings, not to make me miserable for life, by\r\nimplanting an attachment that could only be productive of unhappiness.\r\nHis answer was to ask me in marriage.\r\n\r\nI need not say that my mother gratefully consented; that my father,\r\nconfined to his bed since the fire, thanked God with rapture; that my\r\nsisters were transported by delight: I was the least surprised then,\r\nthough the most happy. Now, I wonder much, what could he see in me? So\r\nmany girls of rank and fortune were prettier. I was an untaught,\r\nlow-born, portionless girl. It was very strange.\r\n\r\nThen I only thought of the happiness of marrying him, of being loved, of\r\npassing my life with him. My wedding day was fixed. Lord Reginald had\r\nneither father nor mother to interfere with his arrangements. He told no\r\nrelation; he became one of our family during the interval. He saw no\r\ndeficiencies in our mode of life\u2014in my dress; he was satisfied with all;\r\nhe was tender, assiduous, and kind, even to my elder sisters; he seemed\r\nto adore my mother, and became a brother to my sister Susan. She was in\r\nlove, and asked him to intercede to gain her parents\u2019 consent for her\r\nchoice. He did so; and though before, Lawrence Cooper, the carpenter of\r\nthe place, had been disdained, supported by him, he was accepted.\r\nLawrence Cooper was young, well-looking, well disposed, and fondly\r\nattached to Susan.\r\n\r\nMy wedding day came. My mother kissed me fondly, my father blessed me\r\nwith pride and joy, my sisters stood round, radiant with delight. There\r\nwas but one drawback to the universal happiness\u2014that immediately on my\r\nmarriage I was to go abroad.\r\n\r\nFrom the church door I stepped into the carriage. Having once and again\r\nbeen folded in my dear mother\u2019s embrace, the wheels were in motion, and\r\nwe were away. I looked out from the window; there was the dear group: my\r\nold father, white-headed and aged, in his large chair; my mother,\r\nsmiling through her tears, with folded hands and upraised looks of\r\ngratitude, anticipating long years of happiness for her child; Susan and\r\nLawrence standing side by side, unenvious of my greatness, happy in\r\nthemselves; my sisters conning over with pride and joy the presents made\r\nto them, and the prosperity that flowed in from my husband\u2019s generosity.\r\nAll looked happy, and it seemed as if I were the cause of all this\r\nhappiness. We had been indeed saved from dreadful evils; ruin had ensued\r\nfrom the fire, and we had been sunk in adversity through that very event\r\nfrom which our good fortune took its rise. I felt proud and glad. I\r\nloved them all. I thought, I make them happy\u2014they are prosperous through\r\nme! And my heart warmed with gratitude towards my husband at the idea.\r\n\r\nWe spent two years abroad. It was rather lonely for me, who had always\r\nbeen surrounded, as it were, by a populous world of my own, to find\r\nmyself cast upon foreigners and strangers; the habits of the different\r\nsexes in the higher ranks so separate them from each other, that, after\r\na few months, I spent much of my time in solitude. I did not repine; I\r\nhad been brought up to look upon the hard visage of life, if not\r\nunflinchingly, at least with resignation. I did not expect perfect\r\nhappiness. Marriages in humble life are attended with so much care. I\r\nhad none of this: my husband loved me; and though I often longed to see\r\nthe dear familiar faces that thronged my childhood\u2019s home, and, above\r\nall, pined for my mother\u2019s caresses and her wise maternal lessons, yet\r\nfor a time I was content to think of them, and hope for a reunion.\r\n\r\nStill many things pained me. I had, poor myself, been brought up among\r\nthe poor, and nothing, since I can remember forming an idea, so much\r\nastonished and jarred with my feelings as the thought of how the rich\r\ncould spend so much on themselves, while any of their fellow-creatures\r\nwere in destitution. I had none of the patrician charity (though such is\r\npraiseworthy), which consists in distributing thin soup and coarse\r\nflannel petticoats\u2014a sort of instinct or sentiment of justice, the\r\noffspring of my lowly paternal hearth, and my mother\u2019s enlightened\r\npiety, was deeply implanted in my mind, that all had as good a right to\r\nthe comforts of life as myself, or even as my husband. My charities,\r\nthey were called\u2014they seemed to me the payment of my debts to my\r\nfellow-creatures\u2014were abundant. Lord Reginald peremptorily checked them;\r\nbut as I had a large allowance for my own expenses, I denied myself a\r\nthousand luxuries, for the sake of feeding the hungry. Nor was it only\r\nthat charity impelled me, but that I could not acquire a taste for\r\nspending money on myself\u2014I disliked the apparatus of wealth. My husband\r\ncalled my ideas sordid, and reproved me severely, when, instead of\r\noutshining all competitors at a f\u00eate, I appeared dowdily dressed, and\r\ndeclared warmly that I could not, I would not, spend twenty guineas on a\r\ngown, while I could dress many sad faces in smiles, and bring much joy\r\nto many drooping hearts, by the same sum.\r\n\r\nWas I right? I firmly believe that there is not one among the rich who\r\nwill not affirm that I did wrong; that to please my husband, and do\r\nhonour to his rank, was my first duty. Yet, shall I confess it? even\r\nnow, rendered miserable by this fault\u2014I cannot give it that name\u2014I can\r\ncall it a misfortune\u2014I have wasted at the slow fire of knowing that I\r\nlost my husband\u2019s affections because I performed what I believed to be a\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nBut I am not come to that yet. It was not till my return to England that\r\nthe full disaster crushed me. We had often been applied to for money by\r\nmy family, and Lord Reginald had acceded to nearly all their requests.\r\nWhen we reached London, after two years\u2019 absence, my first wish was to\r\nsee my dear mother. She was at Margate for her health. It was agreed\r\nthat I should go there alone, and pay a short visit. Before I went, Lord\r\nReginald told me what I did not know before, that my family had often\r\nmade exorbitant demands on him, with which he was resolved not to\r\ncomply. He told me that he had no wish to raise my relatives from their\r\nstation in society; and that, indeed, there were only two among them\r\nwhom he conceived had any claims upon me\u2014my mother and my twin-sister:\r\nthat the former was incapable of any improper request and the latter, by\r\nmarrying Cooper, had fixed her own position, and could in no way be\r\nraised from the rank of her chosen husband. I agreed to much that he\r\nsaid. I replied that he well knew that my own taste led me to consider\r\nmediocrity the best and happiest situation; that I had no wish, and\r\nwould never consent, to supply any extravagant demands on the part of\r\npersons, however dear to me, whose circumstances he had rendered easy.\r\n\r\nSatisfied with my reply, we parted most affectionately, and I went on my\r\nway to Margate with a light and glad heart; and the cordial reception I\r\nreceived from my whole family collected together to receive me, was\r\ncalculated to add to my satisfaction. The only drawback to my content\r\nwas my mother\u2019s state; she was wasted to a shadow. They all talked and\r\nlaughed around her, but it was evident to me that she had not long to\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nThere was no room for me in the small furnished house in which they were\r\nall crowded, so I remained at the hotel. Early in the morning, before I\r\nwas up, my father visited me. He begged me to intercede with my husband;\r\nthat on the strength of his support he had embarked in a speculation\r\nwhich required a large capital; that many families would be ruined, and\r\nhimself dishonoured, if a few hundreds were not advanced. I promised to\r\ndo what I could, resolving to ask my mother\u2019s advice, and make her my\r\nguide. My father kissed me with an effusion of gratitude, and left me.\r\n\r\nI cannot enter into the whole of these sad details; all my half-brothers\r\nand sisters had married, and trusted to their success in life to Lord\r\nReginald\u2019s assistance. Each evidently thought that they asked little in\r\nnot demanding an equal share of my luxuries and fortune; but they were\r\nall in difficulty\u2014all needed large assistance\u2014all depended on me.\r\n\r\nLastly, my own sister Susan appealed to me\u2014but hers was the most\r\nmoderate request of all\u2014she only wished for twenty pounds. I gave it her\r\nat once from my own purse.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I saw my mother I explained to her my difficulties. She told\r\nme that she expected this, and that it broke her heart: I must summon\r\ncourage and resist these demands. That my father\u2019s imprudence had ruined\r\nhim, and that he must encounter the evil he had brought on himself; that\r\nmy numerous relatives were absolutely mad with the notion of what I\r\nought to do for them. I listened with grief\u2014I saw the torments in store\r\nfor me\u2014I felt my own weakness, and knew that I could not meet the\r\nrapacity of those about me with any courage or firmness. That same night\r\nmy mother fell into convulsions; her life was saved with difficulty.\r\nFrom Susan I learned the cause of her attack. She had had a violent\r\naltercation with my father: she insisted that I should not be appealed\r\nto; while he reproached her for rendering me undutiful, and bringing\r\nruin and disgrace on his grey hairs. When I saw my pale mother\r\ntrembling, fainting, dying\u2014when I was again and again assured that she\r\nmust be my father\u2019s victim unless I yielded, what wonder that, in the\r\nagony of my distress, I wrote to my husband to implore his assistance.\r\n\r\nOh, what thick clouds now obscured my destiny! how do I remember, with a\r\nsort of thrilling horror, the boundless sea, white cliffs, and wide\r\nsands of Margate! The summer day that had welcomed my arrival changed to\r\nbleak wintry weather during this interval\u2014while I waited with anguish\r\nfor my husband\u2019s answer. Well do I remember the evening on which it\r\ncame: the waves of the sea showed their white crests, no vessel ventured\r\nto meet the gale with any canvas except a topsail, the sky was bared\r\nclear by the wind, the sun was going down fiery red. I looked upon the\r\ntroubled waters\u2014I longed to be borne away upon them, away from care and\r\nmisery. At this moment a servant followed me to the sands with my\r\nhusband\u2019s answer\u2014it contained a refusal. I dared not communicate it. The\r\nmenaces of bankruptcy; the knowledge that he had instilled false hopes\r\ninto so many; the fears of disgrace, rendered my father, always rough,\r\nabsolutely ferocious. Life flickered in my dear mother\u2019s frame, it\r\nseemed on the point of expiring when she heard my father\u2019s step; if he\r\ncame in with a smooth brow, her pale lips wreathed into her own sweet\r\nsmile, and a delicate pink tinged her fallen cheeks; if he scowled, and\r\nhis voice was high, every limb shivered, she turned her face to her\r\npillow, while convulsive tears shook her frame, and threatened instant\r\ndissolution. My father sought me alone one day, as I was walking in\r\nmelancholy guise upon the sands; he swore that he would not survive his\r\ndisgrace. \u201cAnd do you think, Fanny,\u201d he added \u201cthat your mother will\r\nsurvive the knowledge of my miserable end?\u201d I saw the resolution of\r\ndespair in his face as he spoke.\u2014I asked the sum needed, the time when\r\nit must be given.\u2014A thousand pounds in two days was all that was asked.\r\nI set off to London to implore my husband to give this sum.\r\n\r\nNo! no! I cannot step by step record my wretchedness\u2014the money was\r\ngiven\u2014I extorted it from Lord Reginald, though I saw his very heart\r\nclosed on me as he wrote the cheque. Worse had happened since I had left\r\nhim. Susan had used the twenty pounds I gave her to reach town, to throw\r\nherself at my husband\u2019s feet, and implore his compassion. Rendered\r\nabsolutely insane by the idea of having a lord for a brother-in-law,\r\nCooper had launched into a system of extravagance, incredible as it was\r\nwicked. He was many thousand pounds in debt, and when at last Lord\r\nReginald wrote to refuse all further supply, the miserable man committed\r\nforgery. Two hundred pounds prevented exposure, and preserved him from\r\nan ignominious end. Five hundred more were advanced to send him and his\r\nwife to America, to settle there, out of the way of temptation. I parted\r\nfrom my dear sister\u2014I loved her fondly; she had no part in her husband\u2019s\r\nguilt, yet she was still attached to him, and her child bound them\r\ntogether; they went into solitary, miserable exile. \u201cAh! had we remained\r\nin virtuous poverty,\u201d cried my broken-hearted sister, \u201cI had not been\r\nforced to leave my dying mother.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe thousand pounds given to my father was but a drop of water in the\r\nocean. Again I was appealed to; again I felt the slender thread of my\r\nmother\u2019s life depended on my getting a supply. Again, trembling and\r\nmiserable, I implored the charity of my husband.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am content,\u201d he said, \u201cto do what you ask, to do more than you ask;\r\nbut remember the price you pay\u2014either give up your parents and your\r\nfamily, whose rapacity and crimes deserve no mercy, or we part for ever.\r\nYou shall have a proper allowance; you can maintain all your family on\r\nit if you please; but their names must never be mentioned to me again.\r\nChoose between us\u2014you never see them more, or we part for ever.\u201d\r\n\r\nDid I do right\u2014I cannot tell\u2014misery is the result\u2014misery frightful,\r\nendless, unredeemed. My mother was dearer to me than all the world. I\r\ndid not reply\u2014I rushed to my room, and that night, in a delirium of\r\ngrief and horror, I set out for Margate\u2014such was my reply to my husband.\r\n\r\nThree years have passed since then; and during all this time I was\r\ngrateful to Heaven for being permitted to do my duty by my mother; and\r\nthough I wept over the alienation of my husband, I did not repent. But\r\nshe, my angelic support, is no more. My father survived my mother but\r\ntwo months; remorse for all he had done, and made me suffer, cut short\r\nhis life. His family by his first wife are gathered round me; they\r\nimportune, they rob, they destroy me. Last week I wrote to Lord\r\nReginald. I communicated the death of my parents; I represented that my\r\nposition was altered; and that if he still cared for his unhappy wife\r\nall might be well. Yesterday his answer came.\u2014It was too late, he\r\nsaid;\u2014I had myself torn asunder the ties that united us\u2014they never could\r\nbe knit together again.\r\n\r\nBy the same post came a letter from Susan. She is happy. Cooper,\r\nawakened to a manly sense of the duties of life, is thoroughly reformed.\r\nHe is industrious and prosperous. Susan asks me to join her. I am\r\nresolved to go. Oh! my home, and recollections of my youth, where are ye\r\nnow? envenomed by serpents\u2019 stings, I long to dose my eyes on every\r\nscene I have ever viewed. Let me seek a strange land, a land where a\r\ngrave will soon be opened for me. I desire to die. I am told that Lord\r\nReginald loves another, a high-born girl; that he openly curses our\r\nunion as the obstacle to his happiness. The memory of this will poison\r\nthe oblivion I go to seek. He will soon be free. Soon will the hand he\r\nonce so fondly took in his and made his own, which, now flung away,\r\ntrembles with misery as it traces these lines, moulder in its last\r\ndecay.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIV.\r\n\r\n                              _THE POLE._\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was near the close of day that a travelling cal\u00e8che, coming from\r\nRome, was seen approaching at full gallop towards Mola di Gaeta. The\r\nroad leading to the inn is rocky and narrow; on one side is an orange\r\ngrove, extending to the sea; on the other, an old Roman wall, overgrown\r\nby blossoming shrubs, enormous aloes, floating tangles of vines, and a\r\nthousand species of parasite plants peculiar to the South. Scarcely had\r\nthe cal\u00e8che entered this defile, when the careless postillion drove one\r\nof the wheels over a protruding ledge of rock, and overturned it; and,\r\nin the next moment, a crowd of people came running to the spot. Not one\r\nof them, however, thought of relieving the traveller within the fallen\r\nvehicle; but, with violent gestures and loud outcries, began to examine\r\nwhat damage the cal\u00e8che had sustained, and what profit they might derive\r\nfrom it. The wheelwright declared every wheel was shattered; the\r\ncarpenter that the shafts were splintered; whilst the blacksmith,\r\npassing and repassing under the carriage, tugged at every clamp and\r\nscrew and nail, with all the violence necessary to ensure himself a\r\nhandsome job. The traveller it contained having quietly disengaged\r\nhimself from various cloaks, books, and maps, now slowly descended, and\r\nfor a moment the busy crowd forgot their restlessness, to gaze upon the\r\nnoble figure of the stranger. He seemed to be scarcely two-and-twenty.\r\nIn stature he was tall, and his form was moulded in such perfect\r\nproportions, that it presented a rare combination of youthful lightness\r\nand manly strength. His countenance, had you taken from it its deep\r\nthoughtfulness and its expression of calm intrepid bravery, might have\r\nbelonged to the most lovely woman, so transparently blooming was his\r\ncomplexion, so regular his features, so blond and luxuriant his hair. Of\r\nall those present, he seemed the least concerned at the accident; he\r\nneither looked at the cal\u00e8che, nor paid any attention to the offers of\r\nservice that were screamed from a dozen mouths; but, drawing out his\r\nwatch, asked his servant if the carriage was broken.\r\n\r\n\u201cPann,[4] the shafts are snapped, two of the springs are injured, and\r\nthe linch-pin has flown.\u201d\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  My Lord, in Polish.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long will it take to repair them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTwenty-four hours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is now four o\u2019clock. See that everything be in order again by\r\nto-morrow\u2019s daybreak.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPann, with these lazy Italians, I fear it will be impossible\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYa paswalam,\u201d[5] replied the traveller coldly, but decidedly. \u201cPay what\r\nyou will, but let all be ready for the hour I have mentioned.\u201d\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  I will it, in Polish.\r\n\r\nWithout another word, he walked towards the inn, followed by the crowd,\r\nteasing for alms. A few seconds ago they had all been active and healthy\r\nbeings, so full of employment they could not afford to mend his cal\u00e8che\r\nunless tempted by some extraordinary reward; now the men declared\r\nthemselves cripples and invalids, the children were orphans, the women\r\nhelpless widows, and they would all die of hunger if his Eccellenza did\r\nnot bestow a few _grani_. \u201cWhat a tedious race!\u201d exclaimed the\r\ntraveller, casting a handful of coins upon the ground, which caused a\r\ngeneral scramble, and enabled him to proceed unmolested. At the inn new\r\ntorments awaited him; a fresh crowd, composed of the landlord, the\r\nlandlady, and their waiters and hostlers, gathered round, and assailed\r\nhim with innumerable questions. The landlord hoped none of his limbs\r\nwere broken, and begged him to consider himself master of the house; the\r\nwaiters desired to know at what hour he would sup, what fare he chose,\r\nhow long he intended to stay, where he came from, whither he was going;\r\nand the landlady led him, ostentatiously, through all the rooms of the\r\ninn, expatiating endlessly upon the peculiar and indescribable\r\nadvantages of each. Ineffably weary of their officiousness, the\r\ntraveller at last traversed a long and spacious hall, and took refuge in\r\na balcony that looked upon the bay of Gaeta.\r\n\r\nThe inn is built upon the site of Cicero\u2019s Villa. Beneath the balcony,\r\nand on each side, along the whole curve of the bay, stretched a thick\r\ngrove of orange-trees, which sloped down to the very verge of the\r\nMediterranean. Balls of golden fruit, and blossoms faint with odour, and\r\nfair as stars, studded this amphitheatre of dark foliage; and at its\r\nextremity the liquid light of the waves pierced the glossy leaves,\r\nmingling their blue splendour with earth\u2019s green paradise. Every rock\r\nand mountain glowed with a purple hue, so intense and soft, they\r\nresembled violet vapours dissolving into the pale radiance of the\r\nevening sky. Far away in the deep broad flood of the ocean rose the two\r\nmountain islands of Ischia and Procida, between which Vesuvius thrust in\r\nhis jagged form, and his floating banner of snow-white smoke. The\r\nsolitary heaven was without sun or moon, without a star or cloud, but\r\nsmiled in that tender vestal light which speaks of eternal, immutable\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to define the feelings of the traveller as he\r\ngazed on this scene: his countenance, uplifted to heaven, was animated\r\nwith a profound and impassioned melancholy, with an expression of an\r\nearnest and fervid pleading against some vast and inevitable wrong. He\r\nwas thinking of his country; and whilst he contrasted its ruined\r\nvillages and devastated fields with the splendour and glow of the fair\r\nland before him, was breathing inwardly a passionate appeal against that\r\nblind and cruel destiny which had consigned Poland to the desolating\r\ninfluence of Russian despotism. His reverie was interrupted by the sound\r\nof a female voice singing in Polish among the orange-trees at his feet.\r\nThe singer was invisible; but the sweetness of her voice, and the\r\nsingular reference of the words (the following prose translation conveys\r\ntheir meaning) to the thoughts of his own mind, filled the traveller\r\nwith surprise:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen thou gazest upon the azure heaven, so mighty in its calm, do not\r\nsay, O bright enchantment, hast thou no pity, that thou dawnest thus in\r\nunattainable loveliness upon my world-wearied eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen the southern wind softly breathes, do not say reproachfully, Thy\r\ncradle is the ether of the morning sun, thou drinkest the odorous\r\nessence of myrtle and lemon blossoms; thou shouldst bear upon thy wings\r\nall sweet emotions, all soft desires; why bringest thou then no healing\r\nto the anguish I endure?\r\n\r\n\u201cNeither in the dark hour, when thou thinkest upon thy country and thy\r\nfriends, say not with grief, They are lost! They are not! Say rather\r\nwith joy, They were illustrious! and it is bliss to know that they have\r\nbeen!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt were wise in me to obey thy lesson, sweet songstress, thought the\r\ntraveller; and revolving in his mind the singularity of the serenade, he\r\ncontinued to gaze upon the trees below. There was no rustling amid their\r\nbranches, no sound which told a human being was concealed beneath their\r\nfoliage; nothing was heard beyond the almost imperceptible breathings of\r\nthe evening air. Did such things exist anywhere but in the imagination\r\nof the poet? He could almost have believed that the spirit of that\r\ndivine scene had assumed a human voice and human words to soothe his\r\nmelancholy, so floating and airy had been the strain, so deep the\r\nsilence that succeeded it. One moment more, and there arose from the\r\nsame spot cries for help uttered in Italian, and shrieks of distress so\r\npiercing, they made the traveller fly with the speed of lightning\r\nthrough the great hall, down the staircase into the garden. The first\r\nobject that met his eyes was the figure of a girl about sixteen, her one\r\narm tightly embracing the stem of a tree, her other angrily repelling a\r\nyoung man who was endeavouring to drag her away.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will not go with you\u2014I love you no longer, Giorgio\u2014and go with you, I\r\nwill not,\u201d shrieked the girl, in tones of mingled violence and fear.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must\u2014you shall,\u201d retorted her aggressor in a voice of thunder.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have found you again, and I won\u2019t be duped by your fooleries,\r\nMarietta.\u2014And who are you, and who begged you to interfere?\u201d added he,\r\nturning fiercely upon the traveller, whose strong grasp had torn him\r\nfrom Marietta.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn officer, as it should seem by your dress;\u2014be pleased to know that I\r\nam also an officer, and risk my displeasure no further.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo officer would ill-treat a defenceless girl,\u201d the Pole replied with\r\nquiet contempt.\r\n\r\nAt this taunt Giorgio quivered with rage. His features, handsome and\r\nregular as those of Italians generally are, became quite distorted. His\r\nhands with convulsive movements sought about his breast for the dagger\r\nthat was concealed there, his dark flashing eyes fixed intently at the\r\nsame time upon his adversary, as if he hoped the fiendish spirit that\r\nburned within them might previously annihilate him.\r\n\r\n\u201cBe on your guard\u2014he is a perfect wretch,\u201d cried Marietta, rushing\r\ntowards her protector.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of several servants from the inn dispelled all idea of\r\npresent danger: they dragged off Giorgio, telling him that, although the\r\ngirl was his sister, he had no right to separate her from the _corps\r\nd\u2019opera_, with whom she was travelling through Gaeta.\r\n\r\n\u201c_E vero \u00e8 verissimo_,\u201d cried Marietta with joyful triumph.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it to him if I like my liberty, and prefer wandering about,\r\nsinging here and there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMarietta! beware! dare not to speak ill of me!\u201d screamed the retiring\r\nGiorgio, looking back over his shoulder, and accompanying his words with\r\na look of such frightful menace as completely subdued his sister.\r\n\r\nShe watched in anxious silence till he had disappeared, and then, with\r\naffectionate humility and a graceful quickness that allowed not of its\r\nprevention, knelt lightly down, and pressed the stranger\u2019s hand to her\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have more than repaid me for the song I sang to you,\u201d she said,\r\nrising and leading the way to the inn; \u201cand, if you like it, I will sing\r\nothers to you whilst you sup.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you a Pole?\u201d inquired the traveller.\r\n\r\n\u201cA fine demand! how can I be a Pole? Did you not say yourself there was\r\nno longer any such country as Poland?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI? not that I recollect.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you did not say it, confess at least that you thought it. The Poles\r\nare all become Russians, and for nothing in the world, Signor, would I\r\nbe a Russian. Why in all their language they have no word that expresses\r\n_honour_.[6] No! rather than be a Russian, much as I hate it, I would go\r\nwith Giorgio.\u201d\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  This is true. The Russian language is without that word.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you an Italian?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014not exactly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUm! I am what I am; who can be more? But, Signor, one thing I must beg\r\nof you, do not ask me any questions about myself, nor any about Giorgio.\r\nI will sing to you, talk to you, wait upon you\u2014anything of that kind you\r\nplease, but I will not answer questions on those subjects.\u201d\r\n\r\nSeating herself upon a stool, in a dark corner of the traveller\u2019s\r\napartment, as far removed as possible from him, and all other\r\ninterruptions, Marietta passed the evening in playing on her guitar and\r\nsinging. She was a most accomplished singer, possessing and managing all\r\nthe intricacies of the art with perfect ease, but this scarcely excited\r\nadmiration in comparison with the natural beauty of her voice. There was\r\na profound melancholy in its intense sweetness, that dissolved the soul\r\nof the traveller in grief. All that was dear to him in the memory of the\r\npast,\u2014the joys of home and childhood, the tenderness and truth of his\r\nfirst friendships, the glow of patriotism; every cherished hour, every\r\nendeared spot, all that he had loved, and all that he had lost upon\r\nearth, seemed again to live and again to fade, as he listened to her\r\nstrains. Without paying any attention to him, and apparently without any\r\neffort to herself, she breathed forth melody after melody for her own\r\npleasure, like some lone nightingale, that, in a home of green leaves,\r\nsings to cheer its solitude with sweet sounds. Her countenance and\r\nfigure would have been beautiful had they been more fully developed.\r\nThey resembled those sketches of a great artist in which there are only\r\na few lightly-traced lines, but those so full of spirit and meaning,\r\nthat you easily imagine what a masterpiece it would have been when\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nThe first visit of our traveller, on arriving, next day, at Naples was\r\nto the Princess Dashkhoff. She was a Russian lady, whose high birth,\r\nimmense wealth, and talents for intrigue, had procured for her the\r\nintimacy of half the crowned heads of Europe, and had made her\r\nall-powerful at the Court of St. Petersburg. Detesting the cold\r\nbarbarism of her native country, she had established herself at Naples,\r\nin a splendid mansion, near the Strada Nuova; and affecting an\r\nextravagant admiration for Italy, by her munificent patronage of the\r\narts and artists, and by perpetual exhibitions of her own skill, in\r\ndrawing and singing, dancing and acting, had obtained the name of the\r\nCorinna of the North. Her _salon_ was the evening resort of the wise,\r\nthe idle, the witty, and the dissipated. Not to know Corinna was to be\r\nyourself unknown; and not to frequent her _conversazioni_ was, as far as\r\nsociety was concerned, to be banished from all that was fashionable or\r\ndelightful in Naples.\r\n\r\nIt was the hour of evening reception. The Pole burned with impatience to\r\nspeak to the Princess, for on her influence, at Petersburg, depended the\r\nfate of his only brother. A splendid suite of apartments, blazing with\r\nlights, crowded with company, lay open before him; without allowing\r\nhimself to be announced, he entered them. When a highly imaginative mind\r\nis absorbed by some master feeling, all opposing contrasts, all glowing\r\nextremes, serve but to add depth and intensity to that feeling. The\r\nfestal scene of marble columns garlanded by roses, the walls of Venetian\r\nmirror, reflecting the light of innumerable tapers, and the forms of\r\nlovely women and gay youths floating in the mazy dance, seemed to him\r\ndeceitful shows that veiled some frightful sorrow; and with eager, rapid\r\nsteps, as if borne along by the impulse of his own thoughts, he hurried\r\npast them. Scarcely knowing how he had arrived there, he at length found\r\nhimself standing beside the Princess, in a marble colonnade, open above\r\nto the moonlight and the stars of heaven, and admitting at its sides the\r\nodours of the blossoming almond trees of the adjacent gardens.\r\n\r\n\u201cLadislas!\u201d exclaimed the lady, starting; \u201cis it possible\u2014to see you\r\nhere almost exceeds belief.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter remaining some moments in deep silence, collecting and arranging\r\nhis thoughts, the Pole replied. A conversation ensued, in so low a voice\r\nas to be only audible to themselves; from their attitudes and gestures\r\nit might be inferred that Ladislas was relating some tale of deep\r\nanguish, mixed with solemn and impressive adjurations, to which the\r\nPrincess listened with a consenting tranquillizing sympathy.\r\n\r\nThey issued from the recess, walked up the colonnade, and entered a\r\nsmall temple that terminated it. From the centre of its airy dome hung a\r\nlighted alabaster lamp of a boat-like shape, beneath which a youthful\r\nfemale was seated alone sketching a range of moonlight hills that\r\nappeared between the columns. \u201cIdalie,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cI have\r\nbrought you a new subject for your pencil\u2014and such a subject, my\r\nlove\u2014one whose fame has already made him dear to your imagination; no\r\nless a person than the hero of Ostrolenka[7] and the Vistula. So call up\r\none of those brightest, happiest moods of your genius, in which all\r\nsucceeds to you, and enrich my album with his likeness,\u201d spreading it\r\nbefore her.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  At Ostrolenka, the Russian and Polish armies were in sight of one\r\n  another. The destruction of the Poles seemed inevitable; not expecting\r\n  the attack, their lines were not formed, and the Russians were triple\r\n  in number, and advancing in the most perfect order. In this emergency,\r\n  three hundred students from the University of Warsaw drew hastily up\r\n  in a body, and, devoting themselves willingly to death, marched\r\n  forward to meet the onset of the enemy. They were headed by a young\r\n  man, who distinguished himself by the most exalted courage, and was\r\n  the only one of their numbers who escaped. He stationed his band in a\r\n  small wood that lay directly in the path of the Russians, and checked\r\n  their progress for the space of three hours. Every tree of that wood\r\n  now waves above a patriot\u2019s grave. In the meantime the Polish army\r\n  formed, bore down, and gained a brilliant victory.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to refuse any request to a person who has just granted\r\nus an important favour. Ladislas suffered himself to be seated, and as\r\nsoon as the Princess had quitted them, the gloom which had shadowed his\r\nbrow at the names of Ostrolenka and the Vistula vanished. The surpassing\r\nbeauty of the young artist would have changed the heaviest penance into\r\na pleasure. She was lovely as one of Raffaelle\u2019s Madonnas; and, like\r\nthem, there was a silent beauty in her presence that struck the most\r\nsuperficial beholder with astonishment and satisfaction. Her hair, of a\r\ngolden and burnished brown (the colour of the autumnal foliage\r\nilluminated by the setting sun), fell in gauzy wavings round her face,\r\nthroat, and shoulders. Her small, clear forehead, gleaming with gentle\r\nthought; her curved, soft, and rosy lips; the delicate moulding of the\r\nlower part of the face, expressing purity and integrity of nature, were\r\nall perfectly Grecian. Her hazel eyes, with their arched lids and dark\r\narrowy lashes, pierced the soul with their full and thrilling softness.\r\nShe was clad in long and graceful drapery, white as snow; but, pure as\r\nthis garment was, it seemed a rude disguise to the resplendent softness\r\nof the limbs it enfolded. The delicate light that gleamed from the\r\nalabaster lamp above them was a faint simile of the ineffable spirit of\r\nlove that burned within Idalie\u2019s fair, transparent frame; and the one\r\ntrembling, shining star of evening that palpitates responsively to happy\r\nlovers, never seemed more divine or more beloved than she did to\r\nLadislas, as she sat there, now fixing a timid but attentive gaze upon\r\nhis countenance, and then dropping it upon the paper before her. And not\r\nalone for Ladislas was this hour the dawn of passionate love. The same\r\nspell was felt in the heart of Idalie. One moment their eyes met and\r\nglanced upon each other, the look of exalted, eternal love\u2014mute,\r\nblessed, and inexpressible. Their lids fell and were raised no more.\r\nRapture thrilled their breasts and swelled their full hearts; for,\r\nmotionless, and in deep silence, as if every outward faculty were\r\nabsorbed in reverence, they continued, each inwardly knowing, hearing,\r\nseeing nothing but the divine influence and attraction of the other.\r\n\r\nI know not if the portrait was finished. I believe it was not.\r\nNoiselessly Idalie arose and departed to seek the Princess, and Ladislas\r\nfollowed. \u201cWho is that lovely being!\u201d inquired an English traveller some\r\ntime afterward, pointing out Idalie from a group of ladies.\r\n\r\n\u201cA Polish girl\u2014a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of mine,\u201d was the reply of the Princess; \u201ca\r\ndaughter of one of Kosciusko\u2019s unfortunate followers, who died here,\r\npoor and unknown. She has a great genius for drawing and painting, but\r\nshe is so different in her nature from the generality of people, that I\r\nam afraid she will never get on in the world. All the family are wild\r\nand strange. There is a brother who they say is a complete ruffian;\r\nbrave as a Pole and as unprincipled as an Italian! a villain quite\r\nvarnished in picturesque, like one of your Lord Byron\u2019s corsairs and\r\ngiaours. Then there is a younger sister; the most uncontrollable little\r\ncreature, who chose to pretend my house was insupportable, and ran away\r\ninto Calabria or Campagna, and set up as a _prima donna_. But these, to\r\nbe sure, are the children of a second wife, an Italian; and Idalie, I\r\nmust confess, has none of their lawlessness, but is remarkably gentle\r\nand steady.\u201d\r\n\r\nDisgusted with this heartless conversation, which disturbed his ecstasy,\r\nLadislas hastily quitted the Dashkhoff palace, and entered the Villa\r\nReale, whose embowering trees promised solitude. Not one straggler of\r\nthe gay crowds that frequent this luxurious garden from morning till\r\nmidnight was now to be seen. With its straight walks buried in gloom and\r\nshadow; its stone fonts of sleeping water; its marble statues, its\r\nheaven-pointing obelisks, and its midnight air, it was silent as a\r\ndeserted oratory, when the last strain of the vesper hymn has died away,\r\nthe last taper has ceased to burn, the last censer has been flung, and\r\nboth priests and worshippers have departed. Ladislas cast himself upon a\r\nstone seat in the ilex grove that skirts the margin of the bay. \u201cI\r\ndreamt not of love,\u201d he exclaimed; \u201cI sought her not! I had renounced\r\nlife and all its train of raptures, hopes, and joys. Cold, and void of\r\nevery wish, the shadow of death lay upon my heart; suddenly she stood\r\nbefore me, lovely as an angel that heralds departed spirits to the\r\nkingdom of eternal bliss. Fearless, but mild, she poured the magic of\r\nher gaze upon my soul. I speak the word of the hour. She shall be\r\nmine\u2014or I will die!\u201d\r\n\r\nReclining in the ilex grove, Ladislas passed the remaining hours of that\r\ntoo short night, entranced in bliss, as if the bright form of his\r\nbeloved were still shining beside him. Gradually every beauty of the\r\nwondrous and far-famed Bay of Naples impressed itself upon his\r\nattention. The broad and beamless moon sinking behind the tall elms of\r\nPosilippo; the broken starlight on the surface of the waves\u2014their\r\nrippling sound as they broke at his feet; Sorrento\u2019s purple promontory,\r\nand the gentle wind that blew from it; the solitary grandeur of Capri\u2019s\r\nmountain-island rising out of the middle of the bay, a colossal sphinx\r\nguarding two baths of azure light; Vesuvius breathing its smoke, and\r\nflame, and sparks, in the cloudless ether;\u2014all became mingled in\r\ninexplicable harmony with his new-born passion, and were indelibly\r\nassociated with his recollection of that night.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Idalie was sketching in the Villa Reale. She had seated\r\nherself on the outside of a shady alley. Two persons passed behind her,\r\nand the childish petulant voice of one of them drew her attention. That\r\nvoice, so sweet even in its impatience, certainly belonged to her\r\nfugitive sister. \u201cIt is she!\u201d exclaimed Idalie, gliding swift as thought\r\nbetween the trees, and folding the speaker to her bosom. \u201cMarietta\u2014my\r\ndear little Marietta! at last you are come back again. _Cattivella!_ now\r\npromise to stay with me. You know not how miserable I have been about\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! I cannot promise anything of the kind,\u201d replied Marietta, playing\r\nwith the ribands of her guitar. \u201cI choose to have my liberty.\u201d\r\n\r\nIdalie\u2019s arms sunk, and her eyes were cast upon the ground when she\r\nheard the cold and decided tone in which this refusal was pronounced. On\r\nraising the latter, they glanced upon the companion of her sister, and\r\nwere filled with unconquerable emotion at discovering Ladislas, the\r\nelected of her heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cI met your sister here a few minutes ago,\u201d explained he, partaking her\r\nfeelings; \u201cand having been so fortunate the other day as to render her a\r\nslight service\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d interrupted Marietta; \u201cI sung for him a whole evening at\r\nGaeta. It was a curious adventure. His carriage was overturned close to\r\nthe inn. I had arrived there half an hour before, and was walking in an\r\norange grove near the spot, and saw the accident happen, and heard him\r\nspeak in Polish to his servant. My heart beat with joy. He looked\r\nwondrous melancholy. I thought it must be about his country, so I crept\r\nas softly as a mouse among the trees under his balcony, and sung him a\r\nsalve-song in Polish. I improvised it on the spur of the moment. I do\r\nnot very well recollect it, but it was about azure heavens, southern\r\nwinds, myrtle and lemon blossoms, and the illustrious unfortunate; and\r\nit ought to have pleased him. Just as I had finished, out starts our\r\nblessed brother, Giorgio, from the inn, and began one of his most\r\nterrific bothers. Imagine how frightened I was, for I thought he was\r\ngone to Sicily with his regiment. However, they got him away, and I\r\nfollowed this stranger into his room, and sang to him the rest of the\r\nevening. All my best songs,\u2014the \u2018Mio ben quando verr\u00e0,\u2019 \u2018Nina pazza per\r\nAmore,\u2019 the \u2018All\u2019 armi\u2019 of Generali; the \u2018Dolce cara patria,\u2019 from\r\n_Tancredi_; the \u2018Deh calma,\u2019 from _Otello_,\u2014all my whole stock I assure\r\nyou.\u201d Thus rattled on Marietta; and then, as if her quick eye had\r\nalready discovered the secret of their attachment, she added, with an\r\narch smile, \u201cbut don\u2019t be frightened, Idalie, though his eyes filled\r\nwith tears whilst I sung, as yours often do, not a word of praise did\r\nthe Sarmatian bestow on me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen return and live with me, dear Marietta, and I will praise you as\r\nmuch, and more than you desire.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Santa Maria del Pi\u00ea di Grotta!_ What a tiresome person you are,\r\nIdalie. When you have got an idea into your head, an earthquake would\r\nnot get it out again. Have I not told you that I will not. If you knew\r\nthe motive you would approve my resolution. I said I liked my liberty,\r\nand so forth; but that was not the reason of my flight. I do not choose\r\nto have anything to do with Giorgio and the Princess; for, believe me,\r\ndearest Idalie, disgraceful as my present mode of life seems to you, it\r\nis innocence itself compared with the crimes they were leading me into.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome suspicion of this did once cross my mind,\u201d her sister replied with\r\na sigh, \u201cbut I rejected it as too horrible. Dear child, think no more\r\nabout them. Do you not know that I have left the Princess\u2019 house, and am\r\nliving by myself in a little pavilion far up on the Strada Nuova. There\r\nyou need not fear their molestations.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs not Giorgio then with you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; I have not seen him for some time. I doubt if he be in Naples.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo Messer Giorgio, you have deceived me again. But I might have known\r\nthat, for he never speaks a word of truth. Be assured, however, he is in\r\nNaples, for I caught a glimpse of him this morning, mounting the hill\r\nthat leads to the barracks at Pizzofalcone, and he is as intimate with\r\nthe Princess as ever, though she pretends to disown him. As for me, I am\r\nengaged at San Carlos; the writing is signed and sealed, and cannot be\r\nbroken without forfeiting a heavy sum of money; otherwise I should be\r\nhappy to live peacefully with you; for you know not, Idalie, all I have\r\nhad to suffer; how sad and ill-treated I have been! how often pinched\r\nwith want and hunger; and worse than that, when Giorgio takes it into\r\nhis head to pursue me, and plants himself in the pit, fixing his\r\nhorrible looks upon me as I sing! how many times I have rushed out of\r\nthe theatre, and spent the nights in the great wide Maremma, beset by\r\nrobbers, buffaloes, and wild boars, till I was almost mad with fear and\r\nbewilderment. There is a curse upon our family, I think. Did not our\r\nfather once live in a splendid castle of his own, with a hundred\r\nretainers to wait upon him; and do you remember the miserable garret in\r\nwhich he died? But I cannot stay any longer. I am wanted at the\r\nrehearsal: so, farewell, dearest Idalie. Be you at least happy, and\r\nleave me to fulfil the evil destiny that hangs over our race.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! no!\u201d exclaimed Ladislas, \u201cthat must not be\u2014the writing must be\r\ncancelled,\u201d\u2014and then, with the affection and unreserve of a brother, he\r\nentered into their sentiments; with sweet and persuasive arguments\r\novercame their scruples of receiving a pecuniary obligation from him;\r\nand finally, taking Marietta by the hand, led her away to San Carlos, in\r\norder to cancel her engagement.\r\n\r\nAnd in another hour it was cancelled. Marietta was once more free and\r\njoyful; and, affectionate as old friends, the three met again in the\r\nlittle pavilion, which was Idalie\u2019s home. It stood alone in a myrtle\r\nwood on the last of the green promontories which form the Strada Nuova,\r\nand separate the Bay of Naples from the Bay of Baia,\u2014a lonely hermitage\r\nsecluded from the noise and turmoil of the city, whose only visitors\r\nwere the faint winds of morning and evening, the smiles of the fair\r\nItalian heaven, its wandering clouds, and, perchance, a solitary bird.\r\nFrom every part of the building you could see the Baian Ocean sparkling\r\nbreathlessly beneath the sun; through the windows and the columns of the\r\nportico you beheld the mountains of the distant coast shining on, hour\r\nafter hour, like amethysts in a thrilling vapour of purple transparent\r\nlight, so ardent yet halcyon, so bright and unreal, a poet would have\r\nchosen it to emblem the radiant atmosphere that glows around elysian\r\nisles of eternal peace and joy. Marietta soon left the building to join\r\nsome fisher boys who were dancing the tarantella upon the beach below.\r\nIdalie took her drawing, which was her daily employment, and furnished\r\nher the means of subsistence, and Ladislas sat by her side. There was no\r\nsound of rolling carriages, no tramp of men and horse, no distant\r\nsinging, no one speaking near; the wind awoke no rustling amid the\r\nleaves of the myrtle wood, and the wave died without a murmur on the\r\nshore. Ladislas\u2019 deep but melodious voice alone broke the crystal\r\nsilence of the noonday air. Italy was around him, robed in two\r\nsplendours of blue and green; but he was an exile, and the recollections\r\nof his native land thronged into his memory. During the three months it\r\nhad taken him to effect his escape from Warsaw to Naples, his lips had\r\nbeen closed in silence, whilst his mind had been wrapt in the gloom of\r\nthe dreadful images that haunted it. In Idalie\u2019s countenance there was\r\nthat expression of innocence and sublimity of soul, of purity and\r\nstrength, that excited the warmest admiration, and inspired sudden and\r\ndeep confidence. She looked like some supernatural being that walks\r\nthrough the world, untouched by its corruptions; like one that\r\nunconsciously, yet with delight, confers pleasure and peace; and\r\nLadislas felt that, in speaking to her of the dark sorrows of his\r\ncountry, they would lose their mortal weight and be resolved into\r\nbeauty, by her sympathy. In glowing terms he described the heroic\r\nstruggle of Poland for liberty; the triumph and exultation that had\r\nfilled every bosom during the few months they were free; the hardships\r\nand privations they had endured, the deeds of daring bravery of the men,\r\nthe heroism it had awakened in the women; and then its fall\u2014the return\r\nof the Russians; the horrible character of Russian despotism, its\r\nsternness and deceit, its pride and selfish ignorance; the loss of\r\npublic and private integrity, the disbelief of good, the blighted,\r\nhopeless, joyless life endured by those whom it crushes beneath its\r\nservitude.\r\n\r\nThus passed the hours of the forenoon. Then Ladislas fixing his eyes\r\nupon the coast of Baia, and expressing at the same time his impatience\r\nto visit that ancient resort of heroes and of emperors, Idalie led the\r\nway by a small path down the hill to the beach. There they found a\r\nskiff, and, unmooring it from its rocky haven, embarked in it. It had\r\nbeen sweet to mark the passage of that light bark freighted with these\r\nhappy lovers, when borne by its sails it swept through the little\r\nocean-channel that lies between the beaked promontories of the mainland\r\nand the closing cliffs of the island of Nisida; and when with gentler\r\nmotion it glided into the open expanse of the Bay of Baia, and cut its\r\nway through the translucent water, above the ruins of temples and\r\npalaces overgrown by seaweed, on which the rays of the sun were playing,\r\ncreating a thousand rainbow hues, that varied with every wave that\r\nflowed over them. In all that plane of blue light it was the only moving\r\nthing; and as if it had been the child of the ocean that bore it, and\r\nthe sun that looked down on it, it sped gaily along in their smiles past\r\nthe fortress where Brutus and Cassius sought shelter after the death of\r\nC\u00e6sar; past the temples of Jupiter and Neptune; by the ruins of that\r\ncastle in which three Romans once portioned out the world between them,\r\nto the Cumean hill that enshadows the beloved Linternum of Scipio\r\nAfricanus, and in which he died. The whole of this coast is a paradise\r\nof natural beauty, investing with its own loveliness the time-eaten\r\nwrecks with which it is strewn; the mouldering past is mingled with the\r\nvivid present; ruin and grey annihilation are decked in eternal spring.\r\nThe woody windings of the shore reveal, in their deep recesses, the\r\ngleaming marble fragments of the abodes of ancient heroes; the verdurous\r\nhues of the promontories mingle with the upright columns of shattered\r\ntemples, or clothe, with nature\u2019s voluptuous bloom, the pale funereal\r\nurns of departed gods; whilst the foliage and the inland fountains, and\r\nthe breaking waves upon the shore, were murmuring around their woven\r\nminstrelsy of love and joy. Earth, sea, and sky blazed like three gods,\r\nwith tranquil but animated loveliness; with a splendour that did not\r\ndazzle\u2014with a richness that could not satiate. The air on that beautiful\r\nwarm coast was as a field of fragrance; the refreshing sea-breeze seemed\r\nto blow from Paradise, quickening the senses, and bringing to them the\r\nodour of a thousand unknown blossoms. \u201cWhat world is this?\u201d exclaimed\r\nLadislas in a tone of rapture that nearly answered its own question. \u201cI\r\ncould imagine I had entered an enchanted garden; four heavens surround\r\nme,\u2014the one above; the pure element beneath me with its waves that shine\r\nand tremble as stars; the adorned earth that hangs over it; and the\r\nheaven of delight they create within my breast. \u2018Morning is here a rose,\r\nday a tulip, night a lily; evening is, like morning, again a rose, and\r\nlife seems a choral-hymn of beautiful and glowing sentiments, that I go\r\nsinging to myself as I wander along this perpetual path of flowers.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was night ere they again reached the pavilion. It stood dark and\r\ndeserted in the clear moonshine; the door was locked. After calling and\r\nknocking repeatedly without obtaining any answer, it became evident that\r\nMarietta had quitted the dwelling. In the first moment of surprise which\r\nthis occurrence occasioned, they had not observed a written sheet of\r\npaper, of a large size, which lay unfolded and placed directly before\r\nthe door, as if to attract attention. Idalie took it up and read the\r\nfollowing lines, traced by Marietta:\u2014\r\n\r\n    \u201cOh, Idalie! but a few hours ago, how calm and secure we were in\r\n    happiness\u2014now danger and perhaps destruction is our portion. One\r\n    chance yet remains; the moment you get this, persuade\u2014not only\r\n    persuade\u2014but compel that adorable stranger to fly instantly from\r\n    Naples. He is not safe here an instant longer. Do not doubt what I\r\n    say, or his life may be the forfeit. How can I impress this on your\r\n    mind? I would not willingly betray any one, but how else can I save\r\n    him? Giorgio has been here. Oh! the frightful violence of that man.\r\n    He raved like an insane person, and let fall such dark and bloody\r\n    hints as opened worlds of horror to me. I am gone to discover what I\r\n    can. I know his haunts, and his associates, and shall soon find out\r\n    if there be any truth in what he threatens. I could not await your\r\n    return, neither dare I leave the pavilion open. Who knows if, in the\r\n    interval between my departure and your return, an assassin might not\r\n    conceal himself within; and your first welcome be, to see the\r\n    stranger fall lifeless at your feet. His every step is watched by\r\n    spies armed for his destruction. I know not what to do\u2014and yet it\r\n    seems to me that my going may possibly avert the catastrophe.\u201d\r\n\r\n                                                              \u201cMARIETTA\u201d\r\n\r\nLadislas listened to these lines unmoved; but the effect they produced\r\non Idalie was dreadful. She gave implicit credence to them, and every\r\nword sounded as a knell. She lost all presence of mind; every reflection\r\nthat might have taught her to avert the stroke she so much dreaded, was\r\nswallowed up in anguish, as if the deed that was to be consummated were\r\nalready done. What task can be more difficult than to describe the\r\noverwhelming agony which heavy and unexpected misery produces. To have\r\nlived the day that Idalie had just lived\u2014a day in which all the beauty\r\nof existence had been unveiled to its very depths; to have dreamt, as\r\nshe had done, a dream of love that steeped her soul in divine and almost\r\nuncommunicable joy; and now to sink from this pinnacle of happiness into\r\na black and lampless cavern, the habitation of death, whose spectral\r\nform and chilling spirit was felt through all the air! This is but a\r\nfeeble metaphor of the sudden transition from rapture to misery which\r\nIdalie experienced. She looked upon Ladislas, and beheld him bright and\r\nfull of life; the roseate hues of health upon his cheek, his eyes\r\nbeaming with peaceful joy, his noble countenance varying not in the\r\nleast from that imperturbable self-possession which was its habitual\r\nexpression. And as her imagination made present to her the fatal moment,\r\nwhen beneath the dagger of the assassin this adored being should sink\r\nbleeding, wounded, and then be for ever lost in death, her blood rushed\r\nto her heart, a deadly pause ensued, from which she awoke in a\r\nbewildering mist of horror. Ladislas beheld her excess of emotion with\r\npain, in which, however, all was not pain, for it was blended with that\r\ntriumphant exultation that a lover ever feels when he for the first time\r\nbecomes assured that he is beloved by the object of his love with an\r\naffection tender and intense as his own.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Idalie recovered some presence of mind, with passionate\r\nsupplications she entreated Ladislas to leave her, to fly this solitary\r\nspot, and to seek safety amid the crowded streets of Naples. He would\r\nnot hear of this; he gently remonstrated with her upon the\r\nunreasonableness of her terrors, urging how little probable it was that\r\nhis passing _rencontre_ with Giorgio at Gaeta could have awakened in him\r\nsuch a deadly spirit of revenge as Marietta represented. He viewed the\r\nwhole thing lightly, attributing it either to the vivacity of Marietta\u2019s\r\nimagination, which had made her attach a monstrous import to some angry\r\nexpressions of her brother, or looking upon it as a merry device which\r\nshe had contrived in order to frighten them; and tranquillized Idalie by\r\nassurances that they would shortly see her wild sister return laughing,\r\nand full of glee at the success of her plot. In this expectation two\r\nhours passed away, but still no Marietta appeared, and it had grown too\r\nlate to seek another shelter without exposing Idalie to the slander of\r\nevil-minded people. They passed the rest of the night therefore in the\r\nportico, Idalie sometimes pale and breathless, with recurring fears, and\r\nsometimes calm and happy, as Ladislas poured forth his tale of\r\npassionate love. His feelings, on the contrary, were pure and unalloyed.\r\nWhere Idalie was, there was the whole universe to him; where she was\r\nnot, there was only a formless void. He had an insatiable thirst for her\r\npresence, which only grew intenser with the enjoyment of its own desire;\r\nand he blessed the fortunate occurrence that prolonged his bliss during\r\nhours which otherwise would have been spent pining in absence from her.\r\nNo other considerations intruded. Blessings kindled within his eyes as\r\nhe gazed upon that lovely countenance and faultless form, and angels\r\nmight have envied his happiness.\r\n\r\nMorning came, bright and serene; the sun arose, the ocean and the\r\nmountains again resumed their magic splendour; the myrtle woods and\r\nevery minuter bloom of the garden shone out beneath the sun, and the\r\nwhole earth was a happy form made perfect by the power of light. They\r\nrecollected that they had promised to join the Princess Dashkhoff, and a\r\nlarge party of her friends, at eight o\u2019clock, in an excursion to P\u00e6stum.\r\nThe point of meeting was the shore of the Villa Reale, where the\r\nnumerous guests were to embark in a steamer which had been engaged for\r\nthe occasion. In Idalie\u2019s present homeless and uncertain condition, this\r\nplan offered some advantages. It would enable them to pass the day in\r\neach other\u2019s society under the auspices of the Princess, and it was to\r\nbe hoped that on their return the mystery of Marietta\u2019s disappearance\r\nwould be unravelled, and Idalie find her home once more open to her.\r\nThey had scarcely settled to go, ere one of those horse calessini which\r\nply in the streets of Naples was seen coming towards them. Its driver, a\r\nragged boy, sat on the shaft, singing as he drove; another urchin, all\r\nin tatters, stood as lacquey behind, and between them sat Marietta; the\r\npaleness of fear was on her cheeks, and her eyes had the staggered,\r\naffrighted look of one who has gazed upon some appalling horror. She\r\nhastily descended, and bade the calessino retire to some distance, and\r\nawait further orders.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy is he yet here?\u201d said she to her sister. \u201cYou foolish, blind\r\nIdalie, why did you not mind my letter?\u2014too proud, I suppose, to obey\r\nany but yourself; but mark, you would not hear my warnings\u2014we shall lose\r\nhim, and you will feel them in your heart\u2019s core.\u201d She then, with all\r\nthe violent gesticulation of an Italian, threw herself at the feet of\r\nLadislas, and with a countenance that expressed her own full conviction\r\nin what she said, besought him to fly instantly, not only from Naples,\r\nbut from Italy, for his life would never be safe in that land of\r\nassassins and traitors. With entreaties almost as violent as her own,\r\nLadislas and Idalie urged her to explain, but this only threw her into a\r\nnew frenzy; she declared the peril was too urgent to admit of\r\nexplanation\u2014every moment was precious\u2014another hour\u2019s stay in Naples\r\nwould be his death.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Ladislas was a curious one. He had served in the\r\nRussian campaigns against Persia and Turkey, and had been there daily\r\nexposed to the chances of destruction; in the late struggle between\r\nPoland and Russia, he had performed actions of such determined and\r\ndaring bravery as had made his name a glory to his countrymen, and a\r\nterror to their enemies. In all these exploits he had devoted himself so\r\nunreservedly to death, that his escape was considered as a miraculous\r\ninterposition of Heaven. It was not to be expected that this Mars in a\r\nhuman form, this Achilles who had braved death in a thousand shapes,\r\nshould now consent to fly before the uplifted finger and visionary\r\nwarnings of a dream-sick girl; for such Marietta appeared to him to be.\r\nHe pitied her sufferings, endeavoured to soothe her, but asserted he had\r\nseen no reason that could induce him to quit Naples.\r\n\r\nA full quarter of an hour elapsed before an explanation could be wrung\r\nfrom Marietta. The chaos that reigned in her mind may easily be\r\nimagined. She had become possessed of a secret which involved the life\r\nof two persons. Ladislas refused to save himself unless she revealed\r\nwhat might place her brother\u2019s life in jeopardy. Whichever way she\r\nlooked, destruction closed the view. Nature had bestowed on her a heart\r\nexquisitely alive to the sufferings of others, a mind quick in\r\nperceiving the nicest lines of moral rectitude, and strenuous in\r\nendeavouring to act up to its perceptions. Any deviations in her conduct\r\nfrom these principles had been the work of a fate that, strong and\r\nfierce as a tempest, had bent down her weak youth like a reed beneath\r\nits force. She had once loved Giorgio; he had played with and caressed\r\nher in infancy\u2014with the fond patronage of an elder brother had procured\r\nher the only indulgences her orphaned childhood had ever known.\r\nFraternal love called loudly on her not to endanger his life; gratitude\r\nas loudly called on her not to allow her benefactor to become his\r\nvictim. This last idea was too horrible to be endured. The present\r\nmoment is ever all-powerful with the young, and Marietta related what\r\nshe knew.\r\n\r\nWell might the poor child be wild and disordered. She had passed the\r\nnight in the catacombs of San Gennaro, under Capo di Monte. In these\r\nsubterranean galleries were held the nightly meetings of the band of\r\ndesperate _bravi_ of whom Giorgio was in secret the chief. The entrance\r\nto the catacombs is in a deserted vineyard, and is overgrown by huge\r\naloes; rooted in stones and sharp rocks, they lift their thorny leaves\r\nabove the opening, and conceal it effectually. A solitary fig-tree that\r\ngrows near renders the spot easily recognisable by those already\r\nacquainted with the secret. The catacombs themselves are wide winding\r\ncaves, the burial-place of the dead of past ages. Piles of human bones,\r\nwhite and bleached by time, are heaped along the rocky sides of these\r\ncaverns. In one of these walks, whilst they were friends, Giorgio had\r\nshown the place to Marietta. In those days he feared not to entrust his\r\nmysterious way of life to her; for although in all common concerns she\r\nwas wild and untractable, yet in all that touched the interests of those\r\nfew whom she loved, Marietta was silent and reserved as Epicharis\r\nherself. The menaces Giorgio let fall in his visit on the preceding\r\nforenoon had excited her highest alarm, and she determined, at any risk,\r\nto learn the extent of the danger that hung over the stranger. After\r\nwaiting in vain for Idalie\u2019s return till the close of evening, she had\r\nhastened to Capo di Monte, entered the catacombs alone, and, concealed\r\nbehind a pile of bones, had awaited the arrival of the confederates.\r\nThey assembled at midnight. Their first subject of consultation was the\r\nstranger. Giorgio acquainted them with his history, which he told them\r\nhad been communicated to him that very morning by a Russian lady of high\r\nrank, who had likewise charged him with the business he had to unfold to\r\nthem. He described Ladislas as a fugitive, unprotected by any\r\nGovernment; he bore about his person certain papers which had been found\r\nin the palace of Warsaw, and were the confidential communications of the\r\nRussian Autocrat to his brother the Viceroy of Poland, and were of such\r\na nature as to rouse all Europe against their writer. These papers had\r\nbeen entrusted to Ladislas, whose intention was to proceed to Paris and\r\npublish them there. Private business, however, of the greatest\r\nimportance, had forced him to visit Naples first. The Russian Government\r\nhad traced him to Naples, and had empowered a certain Russian lady to\r\ntake any step, or go any lengths, in order to obtain these papers from\r\nLadislas. This lady had made Giorgio her emissary; her name he carefully\r\nconcealed, but Marietta averred, from his description, that it could be\r\nno other than the Princess Dashkhoff. After much consulting among the\r\nband, the assassination of the Pole had been decided upon. This seemed\r\nto be the only sure method; for he carried the papers ever about his\r\nperson, was distinguished for his bravery, and if openly attacked would\r\nresist to the last. Giorgio was no stickler in the means he employed,\r\nand told his companions he had the less reason to be so in this case, as\r\nhe had received assurances from the highest quarter that his crime\r\nshould go unpunished, and the reward be enormous. Ladislas was almost\r\nunknown in Naples; the Government would not interest itself for a\r\nfugitive, without passport, country or name; and what friends had he\r\nhere to inquire into the circumstances of his destruction, or to\r\ninterest themselves to avenge it?\r\n\r\nSuch was Marietta\u2019s tale, and Ladislas instantly acknowledged the\r\nnecessity of flight. He was too well acquainted with Russian perfidy to\r\ndoubt that even a lady of a rank so distinguished as the Princess\r\nDashkhoff might be induced to undertake as foul a task as that\r\nattributed to her by Marietta. The worldly and artificial manners of\r\nthis lady, in an Italian or a French-woman, would only have resulted\r\nfrom habits of intrigue; but a Russian, unaccustomed to look on human\r\nlife as sacred, taught by the Government of her own country that cruelty\r\nand treachery are venial offences, wholly destitute of a sense of\r\nhonour, concealed, under such an exterior, vices the most odious, and a\r\ncallousness to guilt unknown in more civilised lands. Ladislas knew\r\nthis; and he knew that the badness of the Neapolitan Government afforded\r\nscope for crime, which could not exist elsewhere; and he felt that on\r\nevery account it were better to withdraw himself immediately from the\r\nscene of danger.\r\n\r\nWhile musing on these things, Idalie\u2019s beseeching eyes were eloquent in\r\nimploring him to fly. He consented; but a condition was annexed to his\r\nconsent, that Idalie should share his flight. He urged his suit with\r\nfervour. It were easy for them on a very brief notice to seek the young\r\nlady\u2019s confessor, induce him to bestow on them the nuptial benediction,\r\nand thus to sanctify their departure together. Marietta seconded the\r\nlover\u2019s entreaties, and Idalie, blushing and confused, could only\r\nreply,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMy accompanying you would but increase your danger, and facilitate the\r\nbravo\u2019s means of tracing you. How could I get a passport? How leave this\r\nplace?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have a plan for all,\u201d replied Ladislas; and he then related that the\r\n_Sully_ steam-packet lay in the harbour of Naples, ready to sail on the\r\nshortest notice; he would engage that for their conveyance, and so\r\nspeedily bid adieu to the shores of Naples, and all its perils.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut that boat,\u201d exclaimed Idalie, \u201cis the very one engaged by the\r\nPrincess for the excursion to P\u00e6stum.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis, for a time, seemed to disarrange their schemes, but they\r\nconsidered that no danger could happen to Ladislas while one of a party\r\nof pleasure with the Princess, who from this act of his would be quite\r\nunsuspicious of his intended departure. At night, upon their return from\r\nP\u00e6stum, when the rest of the party should have disembarked at Naples,\r\nLadislas and Idalie would remain on board, and the vessel immediately\r\ncommence its voyage for France. This plan thus assumed a very feasible\r\nappearance, while Ladislas, in accents of fond reproach, asked Idalie\r\nwherefore she refused to share his fortunes, and accompany him in his\r\njourney; and Marietta, clapping her hands exclaimed, \u201cShe consents! she\r\nconsents! Do not ask any more, she has already yielded. We will all\r\nreturn to Naples. Ladislas shall go immediately to seek out the captain\r\nof the _Sully_, and arrange all with him; while, without loss of time,\r\nwe will proceed to the convent of Father Basil, and get everything ready\r\nby the time Ladislas shall join us, which must be with as much speed as\r\nhe can contrive.\u201d\r\n\r\nIdalie silently acquiesced in this arrangement, and Ladislas kissed her\r\nhand with warm and overflowing gratitude. They now contrived to stow\r\nthemselves in the little calessino, and as they proceeded on their way,\r\nLadislas said: \u201cWe seem to have forgotten the future destiny of our dear\r\nMarietta all this time. The friendless condition in which we shall leave\r\nher fills me with anxiety. She is the preserver of my life, and we are\r\nboth under the deepest obligations to her. What shall you do, Marietta,\r\nwhen we are gone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFear not for me,\u201d exclaimed the wild girl; \u201cit is necessary I should\r\nremain behind to arrange those things which Idalie\u2019s sudden departure\r\nwill leave in sad disorder; but you will see me soon in Paris, for how\r\ncan I exist apart from my sister?\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen near to Naples, Ladislas alighted from the calessino, and directed\r\nhis steps towards the port, while the fair girls proceeded on their way\r\nto the convent. What the bashful, conscious Idalie would have done\r\nwithout her sister\u2019s help, it is difficult to guess. Marietta busied\r\nherself about all; won over the priest to the sudden marriage, contrived\r\nto put up articles of dress for the fair bride\u2019s journey, and thinking\r\nof everything, seemed the guardian angel of the lovers. Ladislas arrived\r\nat the convent; he had been successful with the master of the\r\nsteam-packet, and all was prepared. Marietta heard this from his own\r\nlips, and carried the happy news to Idalie. He did not see her till they\r\nmet at the altar, where, kneeling before the venerable priest, they were\r\nunited for ever. And now time, as it sped on, gave them no moment to\r\nindulge their various and overpowering feelings. Idalie embraced her\r\nsister again and again, and entreating her to join them speedily in\r\nParis, made her promise to write, and then, escorted by her husband,\r\nproceeded to the _Sully_, on board of which most of the party were\r\nalready assembled.\r\n\r\nThe steamer proceeded on its course. Farewell to Naples!\u2014that elysian\r\ncity, as the poet justly calls it; that favourite of sea and land and\r\nsky. The hills that surround it smooth their rugged summits, and descend\r\ninto gentle slopes and opening defiles, to receive its buildings and\r\nhabitations. Temples, domes, and marble palaces are ranged round the\r\ncrescent form of the bay, and above them arise dark masses, and wooded\r\nclefts, and fair gardens, whose trees are ever vernal. Before it the\r\nmighty sea binds its wild streams, and smoothes them into gentlest\r\nwaves, as they kiss the silver, pebbly shore, and linger with dulcet\r\nmurmur around the deep-based promontories. The sky\u2014who has not heard of\r\nthe Italian sky?\u2014one intense diffusion, one serene omnipresence, for\r\never smiling above the boundless sea, and for ever bending in azure\r\nmirth over the flowing outlines of the distant mountains.\r\n\r\nThey first passed Castel-a-Mare, and then the abrupt promontories on\r\nwhich Sorrento and ancient Amalfi are situated. The sublimity and\r\nintense loveliness of the scene wrapt in delight each bosom. The hills,\r\ncovered with ilex, dark laurel, and bright-leaved myrtle, were mirrored\r\nin the pellucid waves, which the lower branches caressed and kissed as\r\nthe winds waved them. Behind arose other hills, also covered with wood;\r\nand, more distant, forming the grand background, was sketched the huge\r\nridge of lofty Apennines. Still proceeding on their way to P\u00e6stum, they\r\nexchanged the rocky beach for a low and dreary shore. The dusky\r\nmountains retired inland, and leaving a waste\u2014the abode of malaria, and\r\nthe haunt of robbers\u2014the landscape assumed a gloomy magnificence, in\r\nplace of the romantic and picturesque loveliness which had before\r\ncharmed their eyes. Ladislas leaned from the side of the vessel, and\r\ngazed upon the beauty of nature with sentiments too disturbed for\r\nhappiness. He was annoyed by the unpropitious presence of the idle and\r\nthe gay. He saw Idalie in the midst of them, and did not even wish to\r\njoin her while thus situated. He shrank into himself, and tried,\r\nforgetting the immediate discomforts of his position, to think only of\r\nthat paradise into which love had led him, to compensate for his\r\npatriotic sorrows. He strove patiently to endure the tedious hours of\r\nthis never-ending day, during which he must play a false part, and see\r\nhis bride engaged by others. While his attention was thus occupied, the\r\nvoice of the Princess Dashkhoff startled him, and, looking up, he\r\nwondered how a face that seemed so bland, and a voice that spoke so\r\nfair, could hide so much wickedness and deceit. As the hours passed on,\r\nhis situation became irksome in the extreme. Once or twice he drew near\r\nIdalie, and tried to disengage her from the crowd; but each time he saw\r\nthe Princess watching him stealthily, while his young bride, with\r\nfeminine prudence, avoided every opportunity of conversing apart with\r\nhim. Ladislas could ill endure this. He began to fancy that he had a\r\nthousand things to say, and that their mutual safety depended on his\r\nbeing able to communicate them to her. He wrote a few lines hastily on\r\nthe back of a letter with a pencil, conjuring her to find some means of\r\naffording him a few minutes\u2019 conversation, and telling her that if this\r\ncould not be done before, he should take occasion, while the rest of the\r\ncompany were otherwise occupied, to steal from them that evening to the\r\nlarger temple, and there await her joining him, for that everything\r\ndepended on his being able to speak to her. He scarcely knew what he\r\nmeant as he wrote this; but, driven by contradiction and impatience, and\r\ndesirous of learning exactly how she meant to conduct herself on the\r\nPrincess\u2019s disembarking at Naples, it seemed to him of the last\r\nimportance that his request should be complied with. He was folding the\r\npaper when the Princess was at his side, and addressed him.\r\n\r\n\u201cA sonnet, Count Ladislas; surely a poetic imagination inspires you; may\r\nI not see it?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd she held out her hand. Taken unaware, Ladislas darted at her a look\r\nwhich made her step back trembling and in surprise. Was she discovered?\r\nThe idea was fraught with terror. But Ladislas, perceiving the\r\nindiscretion of his conduct, masked his sensations with a smile, and\r\nreplied: \u201cThey are words of a Polish song, which I wish Idalie to\r\ntranslate for the amusement of your friends;\u201d and, stepping forward, he\r\ngave Idalie the paper, and made his request. All pressed to know what\r\nthe song was. Idalie glanced at the writing, and, changing colour, was\r\nscarcely able to command her voice to make such an excuse as was\r\nrendered necessary. She said that it required time and thought, and that\r\nshe could not at that moment comply; then crushing the paper between her\r\ntrembling fingers, began confusedly to talk of something else. The\r\ncompany interchanged smiles, but even the Princess only suspected some\r\nlover-like compliment to her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e.\r\n\r\n\u201cNay,\u201d she said, \u201cwe must at least know the subject of these verses.\r\nWhat is it? tell us, I entreat you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTreachery,\u201d said Ladislas, unable to control his feelings. The Princess\r\nbecame ashy pale; all her self-possession fled, and she turned from the\r\nsearching glance of the Pole with sickness of heart.\r\n\r\nThey were now drawing near their destination. Idalie, grasping the\r\npaper, longed to read it before they should reach the shore. She tried\r\nto recede from the party, and Ladislas, watching her movements, in order\r\nto facilitate her designs, entered into conversation with the Princess.\r\nHe had effectually roused her fears and her curiosity; and she eagerly\r\nseized the opportunity which he offered her of conversing with him,\r\nendeavouring to find out whether he indeed suspected anything, or\r\nwhether her own guilty conscience suggested the alarm with which his\r\nstrange expression had filled her. Ladislas thus contrived to engross\r\nher entire attention, and led her insensibly towards the stern of the\r\nvessel; and as they leant over its side, and gazed on the waters\r\nbeneath, Idalie was effectually relieved from all observation. She now\r\ndisengaged herself from the rest of the party, and, walking forward,\r\nread the lines pencilled by Ladislas. Then, terrified by the secret they\r\ncontained, she tore the paper, as if fearful that its contents might be\r\nguessed, and was about to throw the fragments into the sea, when she\r\nperceived the position of the Princess and Ladislas, and was aware that\r\nthe lady\u2019s quick eye would soon discern the floating scraps as the boat\r\npassed on. Idalie feared the least shadow of danger, so she retreated\r\nfrom the vessel\u2019s side, but still anxious to get rid of the perilous\r\npapers, she determined to throw them into the hold. She approached it,\r\nand looked down. Had the form of a serpent met her eye, she had not been\r\nmore horror-struck. A shriek hovered on her lips, but with a strong\r\neffort she repressed it, and, staggering on, leant against the mast,\r\ntrembling and aghast. She could not be deceived; it was Giorgio\u2019s dark\r\nand scowling eye that she had encountered\u2014his sinister countenance,\r\nupturned, could not be mistaken. Was danger, then, so near, so pressing,\r\nor so inevitable? How could she convey the fatal intelligence to her\r\nhusband, and put him on his guard? She remembered his written request,\r\nwith which she had previously determined in prudence not to comply. But\r\nit would now afford her an opportunity, should no other offer, of\r\ninforming him whom she had seen.\r\n\r\nThus perfidy, hate, and fear possessed the hearts of these human beings,\r\nwho, had a cursory observer seen them as they glided over that sea of\r\nbeauty, beneath the azure heaven, along that enchanted shore, attended\r\nby every luxury, waited on by every obvious blessing of life\u2014he would\r\nhave imagined that they had been selected from the world for the\r\nenjoyment of perfect happiness. But sunny sky and laughing sea appeared\r\nto Idalie only as the haunt and resort of tigers and serpents; a dark\r\nmist seemed to blot the splendour of the sky, as the guilty souls of her\r\nfellow-creatures cast their deforming shadows over its brightness.\r\n\r\nThey had now arrived close on the low shore, and horses and two or three\r\nlight open carriages were at the water\u2019s edge to convey them to the\r\ntemples. They landed. Ladislas presented himself to hand Idalie across\r\nthe plank from the vessel to the beach. \u201cYes?\u201d\u2014he asked her in a voice\r\nof entreaty, as he pressed her hand. She softly returned the pressure,\r\nand the word \u201cBeware\u201d trembled on her lips, when the young Englishman\r\nwho had before admired her, and had endeavoured to engross her attention\r\nthe whole day, was again at her side, to tell her that the Princess was\r\nwaiting for her in her carriage, and entreated her not to delay.\r\n\r\nThe party proceeded to where those glorious relics stand, between the\r\nmountains and the sea, rising from the waste and barren soil, alone on\r\nthe wide and dusky shore. A few sheep grazed at the base of the columns,\r\nand two or three wild-eyed men, clothed in garments of undressed\r\nsheepskin, loitered about. Exclamations of wonder and delight burst from\r\nall, while Ladislas, stealing away to the more distant ruin, gladly\r\nescaped from the crowd, to indulge in lonely reverie. \u201cWhat is man in\r\nhis highest glory?\u201d he thought. \u201cHad we burst the bonds of Poland; and\r\nhad she, in her freedom, emulated the magical achievements of Greece;\r\nnevertheless when time, with insidious serpent windings, had dragged its\r\nlength through a few more centuries, the monuments we had erected would\r\nhave fallen like these, and our monuments\u2014a new P\u00e6stum\u2014have existed\r\nmerely to excite idle wonder and frivolous curiosity!\u201d\r\n\r\nLadislas was certainly in no good-humour while he thus vented his\r\nspleen; but was annoyed by two circumstances, sufficient to irritate a\r\nyoung philosopher: he beheld a scene, whose majestic beauty filled his\r\nsoul with sensibility and awe, in the midst of a crowd of pretenders,\r\nmore intent on the prospect of their picnic dinner, than on regarding\r\nthe glories of art; and he saw his bride, surrounded by strangers,\r\nengrossed by their conversation and flattery, and unable to interchange\r\none word or look of confidence with him. He sighed for the hours passed\r\nunder the portico of Idalie\u2019s solitary pavilion, and the near prospect\r\nof their voyage did not reconcile him to the present; for his soul was\r\ndisturbed by the necessity of interchanging courtesies with his enemy,\r\nand haunted by images of treacherous attempts, from which his valour\r\ncould not protect him.\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that the party should dine at the archbishop\u2019s\r\npalace, and not embark again until ten o\u2019clock, when the moon would\r\nrise. After a couple of hours spent among the ruins, the servants\r\ninformed them that their repast was ready; it was now nearly six\r\no\u2019clock, and after they had dined, more than two hours must elapse\r\nbefore they could depart. Night had fallen on the landscape, and the\r\ndarkness did not invite even the most romantic to wander again among the\r\nruins; the Princess, eager to provide for the amusement of her guests,\r\ncontrived to discover a violin, a flute, and a pipe, and with the\r\nassistance of this music, which in the hands of Italian rustics was as\r\ntrue to time and expression as if Weippert himself had presided, they\r\ncommenced dancing. Idalie\u2019s hand was sought by the Englishman; she\r\nlooked round the room, Ladislas was not there; he had doubtless repaired\r\nto the temple to wait for her, and ignorant of the presence of Giorgio,\r\nwholly unsuspicious, and off his guard, to what dangers might he not be\r\nexposed? Her blood ran cold at the thought; she decidedly refused to\r\ndance, and perceiving the Princess whirling round in a waltz, she\r\nhastily quitted the house, and hurried along over the grass towards the\r\nruins. When she first emerged into the night, the scene seemed wrapped\r\nin impenetrable darkness, but the stars shed their faint rays, and in a\r\nfew moments she began to distinguish objects, and as she drew near the\r\ntemple, she saw a man\u2019s form moving slowly among the columns; she did\r\nnot doubt that it was her husband, wrapped in his cloak, awaiting her.\r\nShe was hurrying towards him, when, leaning against one of the pillars,\r\nshe saw Ladislas himself, and the other, at the same moment, exchanging\r\nhis stealthy pace for a tiger-like spring. She saw a dagger flashing in\r\nhis hand; she darted forward to arrest his arm, and the blow descended\r\non her. With a faint shriek, she fell on the earth, when Ladislas turned\r\nand closed with the assassin; a mortal struggle ensued; already had\r\nLadislas wrested the poignard from his grasp, when the villain drew\r\nanother knife. Ladislas warded off the blow, and plunged his own\r\nstiletto in the bravo\u2019s breast; he fell to earth with a heavy groan, and\r\nthen the silence of the tomb rested on the scene; the white robe of\r\nIdalie, who lay fainting on the ground, directed Ladislas to her side.\r\nHe raised her up in speechless agony, as he beheld the blood which\r\nstained her dress; but by this time she had recovered from her swoon;\r\nshe assured him her wound was slight, that it was nothing; but again\r\nsank into his arms insensible. In a moment his plan was formed; ever\r\neager and impetuous, he executed it ere any second thought could change\r\nit. He had before resolved not to rejoin the party in the archbishop\u2019s\r\npalace, but after his interview with Idalie, to hasten on board the\r\nsteamboat; he had therefore ordered his horse to be saddled, had led it\r\nto the temple, and fastened it to one of the columns. He lifted the\r\nsenseless Idalie carefully in his arms, mounted his horse, and turning\r\nhis steps from the lighted and noisy palace, wound his way to the lonely\r\nshore, where he found the captain and his crew already preparing for\r\ntheir homeward voyage. With their help Idalie was taken on board, and\r\nLadislas gave orders for the instant heaving of the anchor, and their\r\nimmediate departure. The captain asked for the rest of the company.\r\n\u201cThey return by land,\u201d said Ladislas. As he spoke the words, he felt a\r\nslight sensation of remorse, remembering the difficulty they would have\r\nto get there; and how, during the darkness of night, they might fear to\r\nproceed on their journey on a tract of country infested by banditti; but\r\nthe senseless and pale form of Idalie dissipated these thoughts: to\r\narrive at Naples, to procure assistance for her, and then if, as he\r\nhoped, her wound was slight, to continue their voyage before the\r\nPrincess Dashkhoff\u2019s return, were motives too paramount to allow him to\r\nhesitate. The captain of the _Sully_ asked no more questions; the anchor\r\nwas weighed; and in the silver light of the moon, they stood off from\r\nthe shore, and made their swift way back to Naples. They had not gone\r\nfar before the care of Ladislas revived his fair bride. Her wound was in\r\nher arm, and had merely grazed the skin. Terror for her husband, horror\r\nfor the mortal strife which had endangered his life, had caused her to\r\nfaint more than pain or loss of blood. She bound up her own arm; and\r\nthen, as there appeared no necessity for medical aid, Ladislas revoked\r\nhis orders for returning to Naples, but stretching out at once to sea,\r\nthey began their voyage to Marseilles.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, during a pause in the dance, the absence of Ladislas and\r\nIdalie was observed by the feasters in the archbishop\u2019s palace. It\r\nexcited some few sarcasms, which as it continued grow more bitter. The\r\nPrincess Dashkhoff joined in these, and yet she could not repress the\r\ndisquietude of her heart. Had Ladislas alone been absent, her knowledge\r\nof the presence of Giorgio, and his designs, had sufficiently explained\r\nits cause and its duration to her; but that Idalie also should not be\r\nfound might bring a witness to the crime committed, and discover her own\r\nguilty share in the deed of blood perpetrated at her instigation. At\r\nlength the rising of the moon announced the hour when they were to\r\nrepair to the shore. The horses and carriages were brought to the door,\r\nand then it was found that the steed of Ladislas was missing.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the Signora Idalie, had she not provided herself with a palfrey?\u201d\r\nasked the Englishman, sneering. They were now about to mount, when it\r\nwas proposed to take a last look of the temples by moonlight. The\r\nPrincess opposed this, but vainly; her conscience made her voice faint,\r\nand took from her the usual decision of her manner; so she walked on\r\nsilently, half fearful that her foot might strike against some object of\r\nterror, and at every word spoken by the party, anticipating an\r\nexclamation of horror; the fitful moonbeams seemed to disclose here and\r\nthere ghastly countenances and mangled limbs, and the dew of night\r\nappeared to her excited imagination as the slippery moisture of the\r\nlife-blood of her victim.\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely entered the temple, when a peasant brought the news\r\nthat the steamboat was gone;\u2014he led Ladislas\u2019 horse, who had put the\r\nbridle into the man\u2019s hands on embarking; and the fellow declared that\r\nthe fainting Idalie was his companion. Terror at the prospect of their\r\ndark ride, indignation at the selfish proceeding of the lovers, raised\r\nevery voice against them; and the Princess, whom conscience had before\r\nmade the most silent, hearing that the Pole was alive and safe, was now\r\nloudest and most bitter in her remarks. As they were thus all gathered\r\ntogether in dismay, debating what was to be done, and the Princess\r\nDashkhoff in no gentle terms railing at the impropriety and ingratitude\r\nof Idalie\u2019s behaviour, and declaring that Poles alone could conduct\r\nthemselves with such mingled deceit and baseness, a figure all bloody\r\narose from the ground at her feet, and as the moon cast its pale rays on\r\nhis yet paler countenance, she recognised Giorgio. The ladies shrieked,\r\nthe men rushed towards him, while the Princess, desiring the earth to\r\nopen and swallow her, stood transfixed, as by a spell, gazing on the\r\ndying man in terror and despair.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has escaped, lady,\u201d said Giorgio; \u201cLadislas has escaped your plots,\r\nand I am become their victim.\u201d He fell as he spoke these words, and when\r\nthe Englishman drew near to raise, and if possible assist him, he found\r\nthat life had entirely flown.\r\n\r\nThus ended the adventures of the Pole at Naples. The Princess returned\r\nin her cal\u00e8che alone, for none would bear her company; the next day she\r\nleft Naples, and was on her way to Russia, where her crime was unknown,\r\nexcept to those who had been accomplices in it. Marietta spread the\r\nintelligence of her sister\u2019s marriage, and thus entirely cleared\r\nIdalie\u2019s fair fame; and quitting Italy soon after, joined the happy\r\nLadislas and his bride at Paris.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XV.\r\n\r\n                              _EUPHRASIA._\r\n\r\n                           A TALE OF GREECE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was not long after the breaking out of the Greek Revolution that\r\nHarry Valency visited Greece. Many an Englishman was led thither at that\r\ntime by the spirit of adventure, and many perished. Valency was not\r\nnineteen; his spirit was wild and reckless;\u2014thought or care had never\r\ntouched his brow; his heart was too light for love. Restless and\r\nenergetic, he longed to try his powers, with the instinct that leads the\r\nyoung deer to butt against trees, or to wrestle with each other in the\r\nforest-dells. He was the only son of a widowed mother, whose life was\r\nwrapped in his, and he loved her fondly; yet left her, impelled by a\r\ndesire for adventure, unable to understand what anxiety and fear meant;\r\nand in his own person eager to meet even misfortune, so that it came in\r\na guise to call forth manly and active struggles. He longed to have the\r\npages of his young life written over by deeds that would hereafter be\r\nmemories, to which he could turn with delight. The cause of Greece\r\nwarmed his soul. He was in a transport of ecstasy when he touched the\r\nshores of that antique land, and looked around on mountain and\r\nmountain-stream, whose names were associated with the most heroic acts,\r\nand the most sublime poetry man ever achieved or wrote. Yes, he was now\r\nin Greece. He was about to fight in her cause against the usurping Turk.\r\nHe had prepared himself by a sedulous study of Romaic; he was on his way\r\nto the seat of Government, to offer his services. To proceed thither\r\nfrom the spot where he had disembarked was a matter of some difficulty;\r\nthe Turkish troops being then in possession of many of the passes. At\r\nlength he heard that a band of about fifty Greek soldiers, headed by a\r\nyoung but brave and renowned chief, was about to pursue the same road;\r\nhe asked, and obtained leave to accompany them.\r\n\r\nHow delightful was the commencement of the journey! How beautiful the\r\ncountry\u2014defile and steep hill-side, by which they proceeded; where the\r\ngrey olive clothed the upland, or vines, embracing elms, red now with\r\nlate summer tints, varied the scene. The mountain-tops were bare, or\r\ncrowned with pines, and torrents ran down the sides and fed a stream in\r\nthe dell. The air was balmy; the cicada loud and merry\u2014to live was to be\r\nhappy. Valency was mounted on a spirited horse; he made it leap and\r\ncaracole. He threw a spear against a tree, and dashed after to recover\r\nit. He fired at a mark as he hurried on at full gallop; every feat was\r\ninsufficient to tame his exhaustless spirits.\r\n\r\nThe chief marked him with eyes, whose deep melancholy expression\r\ndarkened as he gazed. He was known as bravest among the brave; yet\r\ngentle as a woman. He was young and singularly handsome; his countenance\r\nwas stamped with traces of intellectual refinement, while his person was\r\ntall, muscular, and strong, but so gracefully formed, that every\r\nattitude reminded you of some Praxitilean shape of his own native land.\r\nOnce he had been more beautiful; joy, as well as tenderness, and a\r\nsoldier\u2019s ardour had lighted up his dark eye; his lip had been the home\r\nof smiles, and the thoughts, which presided in his brow, had been as\r\nclear and soft and gladsome as that godlike brow itself. Now this was\r\nchanged. Grief had become a master passion: his cheeks were sunken; his\r\neye seemed to brood eternally over melancholy regrets; his measured\r\nharmonious voice was attuned to the utterance of no light fancy or gay\r\nsallies; he spoke only the necessary words of direction to his\r\nfollowers, and then silence and gloom gathered over his face. His sorrow\r\nwas respected; for it was known to be well founded, and to spring from a\r\nrecent disaster. If any of his troop desired to indulge in merriment,\r\nthey withdrew from his vicinity. It was strange to them to hear the\r\nlight laugh of the English youth ring through the grove, and to catch\r\nthe tones of his merry voice, as he sang some of their own gayest songs.\r\nThe chief gazed with interest. There was a winning frankness in the boy;\r\nhe was so very young, and all he did was in graceful accordance with his\r\nage. We are alike mere youths, thought the chief, and how different! Yet\r\nsoon he may become like me. He soars like an eagle; but the eagle may be\r\nwounded, and stoop to earth; because earth contains its secret and its\r\nregret.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Valency, who was some hundred yards in advance, was encountered\r\nby a Greek, riding at full speed towards the advancing troop.\r\n\r\n\u201cBack! back! silence!\u201d the man cried. He was a scout, who had been sent\r\non before, and now brought tidings that a troop of three or four hundred\r\nof the Turkish army were entering the defile, and would soon advance on\r\nthe handful of men which Valency accompanied. The scout rode directly up\r\nto the leader, and made his report, adding,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have yet time. If we fall back but a quarter of a mile, there is a\r\npath I know, by which I can guide you across the mountain; on the other\r\nside we shall be safe.\u201d\r\n\r\nA smile of scorn for a moment wreathed the lip of the chief at the word\r\nsafety, but his face soon reassumed its usual sad composure. The troop\r\nhad halted; each man bent his eye on the leader. Valency, in particular,\r\nmarked the look of scorn, and felt that he would never retreat before\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n\u201cComrades!\u201d the chief thus addressed his men, \u201cit shall never be said\r\nthat Greeks fell back to make way for the destroyers; we will betake\r\nourselves to our old warfare. Before we entered this olive wood, we\r\npassed a thick cover, where the dark jutting mountain-side threw a deep\r\nshadow across our path, and the torrent drowned all sound of voice or\r\nhoof. There we shall find ambush; there the enemy will meet death.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe turned his horse\u2019s head, and in a few minutes reached the spot he\r\nnamed; the men were mostly eager for the fray\u2014while one or two eyed the\r\nmountain-side, and then the path that led to the village, which they had\r\nquitted that morning. The chief saw their look, and he glanced also at\r\nthe English youth, who had thrown himself from his horse, and was busy\r\nloading and priming his arms. The chief rode up to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are our guest and fellow-traveller,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not our comrade\r\nin the fight. We are about to meet danger\u2014it may be that not one of us\r\nshall escape. You have no injuries to avenge, no liberty to gain; you\r\nhave friends\u2014probably a mother\u2014in your native land. You must not fall\r\nwith us. I am going to send a message to warn the village we last passed\r\nthrough\u2014do you accompany my messengers.\u201d\r\n\r\nValency had listened attentively at first; but as the chief continued,\r\nhis attention reverted to his task of loading his pistols. The last\r\nwords called a blush into his cheek.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou treat me as a boy,\u201d he cried; \u201cI may be one in aspect, but you\r\nshall find me a man in heart this day. You also young, I have not\r\ndeserved your scorn!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe chief caught the youth\u2019s flashing eye. He held out his hand to him,\r\nsaying, \u201cForgive me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will,\u201d said Valency, \u201con one condition; give me a post of danger\u2014of\r\nhonour. You owe it to me in reparation of the insult you offered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBe it so,\u201d said the chief; \u201cyour place shall be at my side.\u201d\r\n\r\nA few minutes more and his dispositions were made;\u2014two of the most\r\ndown-hearted of the troop were despatched to alarm the village, the rest\r\nwere placed behind the rocks; beneath the bushes, wherever broken\r\nground, or tuft of underwood, or fragment from the cliff, afforded\r\nshelter and concealment, a man was placed; while the chief himself took\r\nhis stand on an elevated platform, and, sheltered by a tree, gazed upon\r\nthe road. Soon the tramp of horses, the busy sound of feet and voices\r\nwere heard, overpowering the rushing of the stream; and turban and\r\nmusket could be distinguished as the enemy\u2019s troop threaded the defile.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe shout of battle\u2014the firing\u2014the clash of weapons were over. Above the\r\ncrest of the hill, whose side had afforded ambush to the Greeks, the\r\ncrescent moon hung, just about to dip behind; the stars in her train\r\nburnt bright as lamps floating in the firmament; while the fire-flies\r\nflashed among the myrtle underwood and up the mountain-side; and\r\nsometimes the steel of the arms strewn around, dropped from the hand of\r\nthe dead, caught and reflected the flashes of the celestial or earthly\r\nstars. The ground was strewn with the slain. Such of the enemy as had\r\ncut their way through were already far\u2014the sound of their horses\u2019 hoofs\r\nhad died away. The Greeks who had fled across the mountain had reached a\r\nplace of safety\u2014none lay there but the silent dead\u2014cold as the moonbeam\r\nthat rested for a moment on their pale faces. All were still and\r\nmotionless; some lay on the hill-side among the underwood\u2014some on the\r\nopen road\u2014horses and men had fallen, pell mell\u2014none moved\u2014none breathed.\r\n\r\nYet there was a sigh\u2014it was lost in the murmur of the stream; a groan\r\nsucceeded, and then a voice feeble and broken, \u201cMy mother, my poor\r\nmother!\u201d\u2014the pale lips that spoke these words could form no other, a\r\ngush of tears followed. The cry seemed to awake another form from among\r\nthe dead. One of the prostrate bodies raised itself slowly and painfully\r\non its arm, the eyes were filmy, the countenance pallid from approaching\r\ndeath, the voice was hollow, yet firm, that said, \u201cWho speaks?\u2014who\r\nlives?\u2014who weeps?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe question struck shame to the wounded man; he checked his overflow of\r\npassionate sobbings. The other spoke again, \u201cIt was not the voice of a\r\nGreek\u2014yet I thought I had saved that gallant boy\u2014the ball meant for him\r\nis now in my side.\u2014Speak again, young Englishman\u2014on whom do you call?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn her who will weep my death too bitterly\u2014on my mother,\u201d replied\r\nValency, and tears would follow the loved name.\r\n\r\n\u201cArt thou wounded to death?\u201d asked the chief.\r\n\r\n\u201cThus unaided I must die,\u201d he replied; \u201cyet, could I reach those waters,\r\nI might live\u2014I must try.\u201d And Valency rose; he staggered a few steps,\r\nand fell heavily at the feet of the chief. He had fainted. The Greek\r\nlooked on the ghastly pallor of his face; he half rose\u2014his own wound did\r\nnot bleed, but it was mortal, and a deadly sickness had gathered round\r\nhis heart, and chilled his brow, which he strove to master, that he\r\nmight save the English boy. The effort brought cold drops on his brow,\r\nas he rose on his knees and stooped to raise the head of Valency; he\r\nshuddered to feel the warm moisture his hand encountered. It is his\r\nblood; his life-blood he thought; and again he placed his head on the\r\nearth, and continued a moment still, summoning what vitality remained to\r\nhim to animate his limbs. Then with a determined effort he rose, and\r\nstaggered to the banks of the stream. He held a steel cap in his\r\nhand\u2014and now he stooped down to fill it; but with the effort the ground\r\nslid from under him, and he fell. There was a ringing in his ears\u2014a cold\r\ndew on his brow\u2014his breath came thick\u2014the cap had fallen from his\r\nhand\u2014he was dying. The bough of a tree, shot off in the morning\u2019s mel\u00e9e,\r\nlay near;\u2014the mind, even of a dying man, can form swift, unerring\r\ncombinations of thought;\u2014it was his last chance\u2014the bough was plunged in\r\nthe waters, and he scattered the grateful, reviving drops over his face;\r\nvigour returned with the act, and he could stoop and fill the cap, and\r\ndrink a deep draught, which for a moment restored the vital powers. And\r\nnow he carried water to Valency; he dipped the unfolded turban of a Turk\r\nin the stream, and bound the youth\u2019s wound, which was a deep sabre cut\r\nin the shoulder, that had bled copiously. Valency revived\u2014life gathered\r\nwarm in his heart\u2014his cheeks, though still pale, lost the ashy hue of\r\ndeath\u2014his limbs again seemed willing to obey his will\u2014he sat up, but he\r\nwas too weak, and his head dropped. As a mother tending her sick\r\nfirst-born, the Greek chief hovered over him; he brought a cloak to\r\npillow his head; as he picked up this, he found that some careful\r\nsoldier had brought a small bag at his saddle-bow, in which was a loaf\r\nand a bunch or two of grapes; he gave them to the youth, who ate.\r\nValency now recognised his saviour; at first he wondered to see him\r\nthere, tending on him, apparently unhurt; but soon the chief sank to the\r\nground, and Valency could mark the rigidity of feature, and ghastliness\r\nof aspect, that portended death. In his turn he would have assisted his\r\nfriend; but the chief stopped him\u2014\u201cYou die if you move,\u201d he said; \u201cyour\r\nwound will bleed afresh, and you will die, while you cannot aid me. My\r\nweakness does not arise from mere loss of blood. The messenger of death\r\nhas reached a vital part\u2014yet a little while and the soul will obey the\r\nsummons. It is slow, slow is the deliverance; yet the long creeping hour\r\nwill come at last, and I shall be free.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not speak thus,\u201d cried Valency; \u201cI am strong now\u2014I will go for\r\nhelp.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no help for me,\u201d replied the chief, \u201csave the death I desire.\r\nI command you, move not.\u201d\r\n\r\nValency had risen, but the effort was vain: his knees bent under him,\r\nhis head spun round; before he could save himself he had sunk to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy torture yourself?\u201d said the chief. \u201cA few hours and help will come:\r\nit will not injure you to pass this interval beneath this calm sky. The\r\ncowards who fled will alarm the country; by dawn succour will be here:\r\nyou must wait for it. I too must wait\u2014not for help, but for death. It is\r\nsoothing even to me to die here beneath this sky, with the murmurs of\r\nyonder stream in my ear, the shadows of my native mountains thrown\r\nathwart. Could aught save me, it would be the balmy airs of this most\r\nblessed night; my soul feels the bliss, though my body is sick and fast\r\nstiffening in death. Such was not the hour when she died whom soon I\r\nshall meet, my Euphrasia, my own sweet sister, in heaven!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was strange, Valency said, that at such an hour, but half saved from\r\ndeath, and his preserver in the grim destroyer\u2019s clutches, that he\r\nshould feel curiosity to know the Greek chief\u2019s story. His youth, his\r\nbeauty, his valour\u2014the act, which Valency well remembered, of his\r\nspringing forward so as to shield him with his own person\u2014his last words\r\nand thoughts devoted to the soft recollection of a beloved\r\nsister,\u2014awakened an interest beyond even the present hour, fraught as it\r\nwas with the chances of life and death. He questioned the chief.\r\nProbably fever had succeeded to his previous state of weakness, imparted\r\na deceitful strength, and even inclined him to talk; for thus dying,\r\nunaided and unsheltered, with the starry sky overhead, he willingly\r\nreverted to the years of his youth and to the miserable event which a\r\nfew months before had eclipsed the sun of his life and rendered death\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey\u2014brother and sister, Constantine and Euphrasia\u2014were the last of\r\ntheir race. They were orphans; their youth was passed under the\r\nguardianship of the brother by adoption of their father, whom they named\r\nfather, and who loved them. He was a glorious old man, nursed in classic\r\nlore, and more familiar with the deeds of men who had glorified his\r\ncountry several thousand years before than with any more modern names.\r\nYet all who had ever done and suffered for Greece were embalmed in his\r\nmemory, and honoured as martyrs in the best of causes. He had been\r\neducated in Paris, and travelled in Europe and America, and was aware of\r\nthe progress made in the science of politics all over the civilised\r\nworld. He felt that Greece would soon share the benefits to arise from\r\nthe changes then operating, and he looked forward at no distant day to\r\nits liberation from bondage. He educated his young ward for that day.\r\nHad he believed that Greece would have continued hopelessly enslaved, he\r\nhad brought him up as a scholar and a recluse: but, assured of the\r\nimpending struggle, he made him a warrior; he implanted a detestation of\r\nthe oppressor, a yearning love for the sacred blessings of freedom, a\r\nnoble desire to have his name enrolled among the deliverers of his\r\ncountry. The education he bestowed on Euphrasia was yet more singular.\r\nHe knew that though liberty must be bought and maintained by the sword,\r\nyet that its dearest blessings must be derived from civilisation and\r\nknowledge; and he believed women to be the proper fosterers of these.\r\nThey cannot handle a sword nor endure bodily labour for their country,\r\nbut they could refine the manners, exalt the souls\u2014impart honour, and\r\ntruth, and wisdom to their relatives and their children. Euphrasia,\r\ntherefore, he made a scholar. By nature she was an enthusiast and a\r\npoet. The study of the classic literature of her country corrected her\r\ntaste and exalted her love of the beautiful. While a child, she\r\nimprovised passionate songs of liberty; and as she grew in years and\r\nloveliness, and her heart opened to tenderness, and she became aware of\r\nall the honour and happiness that a woman must derive from being held\r\nthe friend of man, not his slave, she thanked God that she was a Greek\r\nand a Christian; and holding fast by the advantages which these names\r\nconferred, she looked forward eagerly to the day when Mohammedanism\r\nshould no longer contaminate her native land, and when her countrywomen\r\nshould be awakened from ignorance and sloth in which they were plunged,\r\nand learn that their proper vocation in the creation was that of mothers\r\nof heroes and teachers of sages.\r\n\r\nHer brother was her idol, her hope, her joy. And he who had been taught\r\nthat his career must be that of deeds, not words, yet was fired by her\r\npoetry and eloquence to desire glory yet more eagerly, and to devote\r\nhimself yet more entirely and with purer ardour to the hope of one day\r\nliving and dying for his country. The first sorrow the orphans knew was\r\nthe death of their adopted father. He descended to the grave full of\r\nyears and honour. Constantine was then eighteen; his fair sister had\r\njust entered her fifteenth year. Often they spent the night beside the\r\nrevered tomb of their lost friend, talking of the hopes and aspirations\r\nhe had implanted. The young can form such sublime, such beautiful\r\ndreams. No disappointment, no evil, no bad passion shadows their\r\nglorious visions. To dare and do greatly for Greece was the ambition of\r\nConstantine. To cheer and watch over her brother, to regulate his wilder\r\nand more untaught soul, to paint in celestial colours the bourne he\r\ntended towards by action, were Euphrasia\u2019s tasks.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a heaven,\u201d said the dying man as he told his tale,\u2014\u201cthere is a\r\nparadise for those who die in the just cause. I know not what joys are\r\nthere prepared for the blest; but they can scarcely transcend those that\r\nwere mine as I listened to my own sweet sister, and felt my heart swell\r\nwith patriotism and fond, warm affection.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt length there was a stir through the land, and Constantine made a\r\njourney of some distance, to confer with the capitani of the mountains,\r\nand to prepare for the outbreak of the revolution. The moment came,\r\nsooner even than he expected. As an eagle chained when the iron links\r\ndrop from him, and with clang of wing and bright undazzled eye he soars\r\nto heaven, so did Constantine feel when freedom to Greece became the\r\nwar-cry. He was still among the mountains when first the echoes of his\r\nnative valleys repeated that animating, that sacred word. Instead of\r\nreturning, as he intended, to his Athenian home, he was hurried off to\r\nWestern Greece, and became a participator in a series of warlike\r\nmovements, the promised success of which filled him with transport.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a pause came in the delirium of joy which possessed his soul.\r\nHe received not the accustomed letters from his sister\u2014missives which\r\nhad been to him angelic messengers, teaching him patience with the\r\nunworthy\u2014hope in disappointment\u2014certainty of final triumph. Those dear\r\nletters ceased; and he thought he saw in the countenances of his friends\r\naround a concealed knowledge of evil. He questioned them: their answers\r\nwere evasive. At the same time, they endeavoured to fill his mind with\r\nthe details of some anticipated exploit in which his presence and\r\nco-operation was necessary. Day after day passed; he could not leave his\r\npost without injury to the cause, without even the taint of dishonour.\r\nHe belonged to a band of Albanians, by whom he had been received as a\r\nbrother and he could not desert them in the hour of danger. But the\r\nsuspense grew too terrible; and at length, finding that there was an\r\ninterval of a few days which he might call his own, he left the camp,\r\nresting neither day nor night; dismounting from one horse only to\r\nbestride another, in forty-eight hours he was in Athens, before his\r\nvacant, desecrated home. The tale of horror was soon told. Athens was\r\nstill in the hands of the Turks; the sister of a rebel had become the\r\nprey of the oppressor. She had none to guard her. Her matchless beauty\r\nhad been seen and marked by the son of the pasha; she had for the last\r\ntwo months been immured in his harem.\r\n\r\n\u201cDespair is a cold, dark feeling,\u201d said the dying warrior; \u201cif I may\r\nname that despair which had a hope\u2014a certainty\u2014an aim. Had Euphrasia\r\ndied I had wept. Now my eyes were horn\u2014my heart stone. I was silent. I\r\nneither expressed resentment nor revenge. I concealed myself by day; at\r\nnight I wandered round the tyrant\u2019s dwelling. It was a pleasure-palace,\r\none of the most luxurious in our beloved Athens. At this time it was\r\ncarefully guarded: my character was known, and Euphrasia\u2019s worth; and\r\nthe oppressor feared the result of his deed. Still, under shadow of\r\ndarkness I drew near. I marked the position of the women\u2019s apartments\u2014I\r\nlearned the number\u2014the length of the watch\u2014the orders they received, and\r\nthen I returned to the camp. I revealed my project to a few select\r\nspirits. They were fired by my wrongs, and eager to deliver my\r\nEuphrasia.\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\nConstantine broke off\u2014a spasm of pain shook his body. After this had\r\npassed he lay motionless for a few minutes; then starting up, as fever\r\nand delirium, excited by the exertion of speaking, increased by the\r\nagonies of recollection, at last fully possessed him. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d he\r\ncried. \u201cFire! Yes, the palace burns. Do you not hear the roaring of the\r\nflames, and thunder too\u2014the artillery of Heaven levelled against the\r\nunblest? Ha! a shot\u2014he falls\u2014they are driven back\u2014now fling the\r\ntorches\u2014the wood crackles\u2014there, there are the women\u2019s rooms\u2014ha! poor\r\nvictims! lo! you shudder and fly! Fear not; give me only my\r\nEuphrasia!\u2014my own Euphrasia! No disguise can hide thee, dressed as a\r\nTurkish bride crowned with flowers, thy lovely face, the seat of\r\nunutterable woe\u2014still, my sweet sister, even in this smoke and tumult of\r\nthis house, thou art the angel of my life! Spring into my arms, poor,\r\nfrightened bird; cling to me\u2014it is herself\u2014her voice\u2014her fair arms are\r\nround my neck\u2014what ruin\u2014what flame\u2014what choking smoke\u2014what driving storm\r\ncan stay me? Soft! the burning breach is passed\u2014there are\r\nsteps\u2014gently\u2014dear one, I am firm\u2014fear not!\u2014what eyes glare?\u2014fear not,\r\nEuphrasia, he is dead\u2014the miserable retainers of the tyrant fell beneath\r\nour onset\u2014ha! a shot\u2014gracious Panagia, is this thy protection?\u201d Thus did\r\nhe continue to rave: the onset, the burning of the palace, the\r\ndeliverance of his sister, all seemed to pass again vividly as if in\r\npresent action. His eyes glared; he tossed up his arms; he shouted as if\r\ncalling his followers around him; and then in tones of heartfelt\r\ntenderness he addressed the fair burden he fancied that he bore\u2014till,\r\nwith a shriek, he cried again, \u201cA shot!\u201d and sank to the ground as if\r\nhis heartstrings had broken.\r\n\r\nAn interval of calm succeeded; he was exhausted; his voice was broken.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have I told thee?\u201d he continued feebly; \u201cI have said how a mere\r\nhandful of men attacked the palace, and drove back the guards\u2014how we\r\nstrove in vain to make good our entrance\u2014fresh troops were on their\r\nway\u2014there was no alternative; we fired the palace. Deep in the seclusion\r\nof the harem the women had retreated, a herd of frightened deer. One\r\nalone stood erect. Her eyes bent on the intruders\u2014a dagger in her\r\nhand\u2014majestic and fearless, her face was marked with traces of passed\r\nsuffering, but at the moment the stern resolution her soft features\r\nexpressed was more than human. The moment she saw me, all was changed;\r\nthe angel alone beamed in her countenance. Her dagger fell from her\r\nhand\u2014she was in my arms\u2014I bore her from the burning roof\u2014the rest you\r\nknow; have I not said it? Some miscreant, who survived the slaughter,\r\nand yet lay as dead on the earth, aimed a deadly shot. She did not\r\nshriek. At first she clung closer to my neck, and then I felt her frame\r\nshiver in my arms and her hold relax. I trusted that fear alone moved\r\nher; but she knew not fear\u2014it was death. Horses had been prepared, and\r\nwere waiting; a few hours more and I hoped to be on our way to the west,\r\nto that portion of Greece that was free. But I felt her head fall on my\r\nshoulder. I heard her whisper, \u2018I die, my brother! carry me to our\r\nfather\u2019s tomb.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cMy soul yearned to comply with her request; but it was impossible. The\r\ncity was alarmed; troops gathering from all quarters. Our safety lay in\r\nflight, for still I thought that her wound was not mortal. I bore her to\r\nthe spot where we had left our horses. Here two or three of my comrades\r\nspeedily joined me; they had rescued the women of the harem from the\r\nflames, but the various sounds denoting the advance of the Turkish\r\nsoldiery caused them to hurry from the scene. I leapt on my horse, and\r\nplaced my sweet sister before me, and we fled amain through desert\r\nstreets, I well knew how to choose, and along the lanes of the suburbs\r\ninto the open country, where, deviating from the high-road, along which\r\nI directed my companions to proceed in all haste\u2014alone with my beloved\r\nburden, I sought a solitary, unsuspected spot among the neighbouring\r\nhills. The storm which had ceased for a time, now broke afresh; the\r\ndeafening thunder drowned every other sound, while the frequent glare of\r\nthe lightning showed us our path; my horse did not quail before it.\r\nEuphrasia still lay clinging to me; no complaint escaped her; a few\r\nwords of fondness, of encouragement, of pious resignation, she now and\r\nthen breathed forth. I knew not she was dying, till at last entering a\r\nretired valley, where an olive wood afforded shelter, and still better\r\nthe portico of a fallen ancient temple, I dismounted and bore her to the\r\nmarble steps, on which I placed her. Then indeed I felt how near the\r\nbeloved one was to death, from which I could not save her. The lightning\r\nshowed me her face\u2014pale as the marble which pillowed it. Her dress was\r\ndabbled in warm blood, which soon stained the stones on which she lay. I\r\ntook her hand; it was deathly cold. I raised her from the marble; I\r\npillowed her cheek upon my heart. I repressed my despair, or rather my\r\ndespair in that hour was mild and soft as herself. There was no help\u2014no\r\nhope. The life-blood oozed fast from her side; scarce could she raise\r\nher heavy eyelids to look on me; her voice could no longer articulate my\r\nname. The burden of her fair limbs grew heavier and more chill; soon it\r\nwas a corpse only that I held. When I knew that her sufferings were\r\nover, I raised her once more in my arms, and once more I placed her\r\nbefore me on my horse, and betook me to my journey. The storm was over\r\nnow, and the moon bright above. Earth glittered under the rays, and a\r\nsoft breeze swept by, as if heaven itself became clear and peaceful to\r\nreceive her stainless soul, and present it to its Maker. By morning\u2019s\r\ndawn, I stopped at a convent gate, and rang. To the holy maidens within\r\nI consigned my own fair Euphrasia. I kissed but once again her dear\r\nbrow, which spoke of peace in death; and then saw her placed upon a\r\nbier, and was away, back to my camp, to live and die for Greece.\u201d\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe grew more silent as he became weaker. Now and then he spoke a few\r\nwords to record some other of Euphrasia\u2019s perfections, or to repeat some\r\nof her dying words; to speak of her magnanimity, her genius, her love,\r\nand his own wish to die.\r\n\r\n\u201cI might have lived,\u201d he said, \u201ctill her image had faded in my mind, or\r\nbeen mingled with less holy memories. I die young, all her own.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis voice grew more feeble after this; he complained of cold. Valency\r\ncontinued: \u201cI contrived to rise, and crawl about, and to collect a\r\ncapote or two, and a pelisse from among the slain, with some of which I\r\ncovered him; and then I drew one over myself, for the air grew chill, as\r\nmidnight had passed away and the morning hour drew near. The warmth\r\nwhich the coverings imparted calmed the aching of my wound, and, strange\r\nto say, I felt slumber creep over me. I tried to watch and wake. At\r\nfirst the stars above and the dark forms of the mountains mingled with\r\nmy dreamy feelings; but soon I lost all sense of where I was, and what I\r\nhad suffered, and slept peacefully and long.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe morning sunbeams, as creeping down the hill-side they at last fell\r\nupon my face, awoke me. At first I had forgotten all thought of the\r\nevents of the past night, and my first impulse was to spring up, crying\r\naloud, where am I? but the stiffness of my limbs and their weakness,\r\nsoon revealed the truth. Gladly I now welcomed the sound of voices, and\r\nmarked the approach of a number of peasants along the ravine. Hitherto,\r\nstrange to say, I had thought only of myself; but with the ideas of\r\nsuccour came the recollection of my companion, and the tale of the\r\nprevious night. I glanced eagerly to where he lay; his posture disclosed\r\nhis state; he was still, and stiff, and dead. Yet his countenance was\r\ncalm and beautiful. He had died in the dear hope of meeting his sister,\r\nand her image had shed peace over the last moment of life.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am ashamed to revert to myself. The death of Constantine is the true\r\nend of my tale. My wound was a severe one. I was forced to leave Greece,\r\nand for some months remained between life and death in Cefalonia, till a\r\ngood constitution saved me, when at once I returned to England.\u201d\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XVI.\r\n\r\n                            _THE ELDER SON._\r\n\r\n\r\nMY father was the second son of a wealthy baronet. As he and his elder\r\nbrother formed all the family of my grandfather, he inherited the whole\r\nof his mother\u2019s fortune, which was considerable, and settled on the\r\nyounger children. He married a lady whom he tenderly loved; and having\r\ntaken orders, and procured preferment, retired to his deanery in the\r\nnorth of Ireland, and there took up his abode. When I was about ten\r\nyears old he lost my mother. I was their only child.\r\n\r\nMy father was something of an ascetic, if such name can be given to a\r\nrigid adherence to the precepts of morality, which arose from the\r\nexcess, and not the absence of feeling. He adored my mother; he mourned\r\nfor her to the verge of insanity; but his grief was silent, devouring,\r\nand gloomy. He never formed another matrimonial engagement: secluding\r\nhimself entirely from society, and given up to the duties of his sacred\r\ncalling, he passed his days in solitude, or in works of charity among\r\nthe poor.\r\n\r\nEven now I cannot remember him without awe. He was a tall and, I\r\nthought, a venerable-looking man; for he was thin and pale, and he was\r\npartly bald. His manners were cold and reserved; he seldom spoke, and\r\nwhen he did it was in such measured phrase, in so calm and solemn a\r\nvoice, and on such serious topics, as resembled rather oracular\r\nenunciation than familiar conversation. He never caressed me; if ever he\r\nstroked my head or drew me on his knee, I felt a mingled alarm and\r\ndelight difficult to describe. Yet, strange to say, my father loved me\r\nalmost to idolatry; and I knew this and repaid his affection with\r\nenthusiastic fondness, notwithstanding his reserve and my awe. He was\r\nsomething greater, and wiser, and better, in my eyes, than any other\r\nhuman being. I was the sole creature he loved; the object of all his\r\nthoughts by day and his dreams by night. Abstracted and even severe as\r\nhe seemed, he has visited my bedside at night, subdued by womanly fears,\r\nand hung over me for hours, to assure himself of my life and well-being.\r\nHe has watched by me in sickness night after night with unwearied\r\nassiduity. He never spoke harshly to me, and treated me at once with a\r\ndistance and gentleness hard to be understood.\r\n\r\nWhen I was eighteen he died. During his last illness the seal was taken\r\nfrom his lips, and his heart threw off that husk within which he had\r\nhitherto concealed its true nature. He died of a rapid consumption,\r\nwhich terminated his existence within six months of his being first\r\ntaken ill. His body wasted under the effects of mortal disease; but his\r\nsoul assumed new life and energy, and his temper became as soft and\r\ndemonstrative as it had hitherto been repulsive and concentrated. He\r\nbecame my father, friend, and brother all in one; a thousand dear\r\nrelationships combined in one stronger than any. This sudden melting,\r\nthis divine sensibility, which expanded at once, having been so long\r\nshut up and hid, was like a miracle. It fascinated and entranced me. I\r\ncould not believe that I was about to lose him at the moment when we\r\ndiscovered each other\u2019s worth: I mean by that expression, as regards\r\nmyself, all the happiness that he derived from the truth and vivacity of\r\nmy filial affection.\r\n\r\nIt were vain to attempt to refer even to our conversations: the sublime\r\nmorality he inculcated; the tenderness and charity of his expressions;\r\nthe overflowing and melting eloquence with which he talked of the\r\naffections of this world, and his aspirations after a better. He died\r\nsuddenly at last, as I was playing to him a simple air my mother loved.\r\nIt was a moment of horror, yet of solemn and pious resignation: his soul\r\nhad sought its native heaven and congenial companion\u2014might it be blest!\r\nYet I had lost him, and grief immeasurable was the result. The\r\nimpression of the misery I suffered can never be entirely worn from my\r\nmind: I often wonder my heart did not break with the violence of my\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nI had been brought up at the deanery, apart from all acquaintances. I\r\nhad had a governess, a most worthy woman, who married just before my\r\nfather was taken ill, and who kindly came to me when all was over, to\r\nendeavour to console the inconsolable. One of my father\u2019s objects in\r\nlife had been to accumulate a fortune for me; not for the sake of\r\nplacing me in the dangerous situation of an heiress, but to render me\r\nindependent. It thus happened that by his ever-lamented death I\r\ninherited considerable wealth. His own fortune, my mother\u2019s, and his\r\nsavings, formed the sum of fifty thousand pounds. He left me under the\r\nguardianship of his elder brother, Sir Richard Gray, with only one\r\nrestriction, that I was not to marry, even with my uncle\u2019s consent, till\r\nI was twenty-one. He wished thus to secure me freedom of choice, and\r\ntime for deliberation. To this sagacious clause I owe the happiness of\r\nmy life.\r\n\r\nAs soon as my health and the first agony of my grief would permit, I\r\nleft the deanery. My kind governess accompanied me to Dublin, and Sir\r\nRichard Gray came hither himself to fetch me, and to carry me to his\r\nseat in England. I was beyond measure surprised when I saw my uncle. He\r\nwas a year older than my father\u2014my venerable father\u2014and he looked in\r\ncomparison a boy. He was indeed under fifty, and had at first sight a\r\njuvenility of aspect quite astonishing. On examination, the traces of\r\nyears and care became perceptible; and there was a haggardness in his\r\nface which contrasted strangely with its expression of thoughtlessness.\r\nNo one could be kinder than he was to me, and yet his very kindness was\r\nrevolting, from the contrast he formed with my lost parent. The world,\r\nsociety, and pleasure occupied his time and thoughts. Solitude and\r\nmisery were synonymous terms with him; and he called everything solitude\r\nthat did not include the idea of a crowd. He rattled away during our\r\njourney, thinking his anecdotes and good stories would enliven me. He\r\nwas so sorry that it was not the season that I could go to London\u2014he\r\nwould have invited his daughter, Lady Hythe, to his seat, that he might\r\narrange a party to enliven it for me; but she was on the Continent, and\r\nhis other married daughter was resident in Scotland. What was to be\r\ndone? He had engagements himself during the shooting season at various\r\ngentlemen\u2019s houses; and I should be moped to death at Beech Grove. This\r\naccount of the seclusion of my retreat was all my comfort. I declared\r\nthat nothing should induce me to go into society for several years. He\r\nstared, and then smiled, and in his usual caressing gallant manner said,\r\nI should do as I liked; he would never contradict me in anything: he\r\nonly hoped that he should be always able to please and gratify me.\r\n\r\nMy uncle\u2019s story is soon told. He married, very early in life, a girl of\r\ninferior rank. His relations were exceedingly enraged, and discarded\r\nhim. His father died; and his grandfather, fearing that he would sell\r\nhis expectations and squander the whole property, offered him a large\r\nimmediate income, upon condition that he would entail the estate upon\r\nhis eldest son. He consented. A few years after, his grandfather died,\r\nand he came into the titles and estate. The new Lady Gray made herself\r\nmany friends from the extreme propriety of her conduct. They had a large\r\nfamily, but lost many children; and she died in childbed of her\r\nyoungest. Five only survived. The eldest son was abroad: two daughters\r\nwere well married, and the youngest, a girl of only twelve years of age,\r\nlived with her governess at the family seat at Hampshire. Sir Richard\r\ntalked kindly of his children, but chiefly of his eldest son, against\r\nwhom therefore I conceived a prejudice; because, from his father\u2019s\r\ndescription, I considered him dissipated and worthless. Such, indeed,\r\nwas my uncle; but I did not dislike him, for by the charm of manner he\r\nvanquished aversion, and I transferred to his favourite son the\r\ndisapprobation he had at first excited. I was glad to hear that my\r\ncousin was at Vienna, and that I was not likely to see him.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Beech Grove on the 29th August. It was a fine summer day,\r\nand the country in all its glory. The house was spacious and elegant,\r\nand situated in an extensive park, laid out with infinite taste, and\r\nkept up with extreme care. All looked so gay and smiling, so unlike the\r\nsombre scenes I had left on the shores of the dark northern ocean, that\r\nI contemplated my new abode with distaste: such is the force of habit.\r\nMy uncle had expected that I should be enchanted with the novel beauty\r\nof an English park and mansion, and was disappointed at my languid\r\npraise. There were no rocks, no sea, no extensive moors. Groves of\r\nbeech, a river threading verdant wooded banks, a variety of upland and\r\nvalley, glade and copse, did not command my admiration; so true it is\r\nthat we seldom admire that which is absolutely new. A few months totally\r\naltered this first impression. The cheerfulness of the scene\r\nimperceptibly acted on my spirits. I became reconciled to its (to a\r\ncertain degree) tameness, and learnt at last to love its refined and\r\nelegant beauty.\r\n\r\nSir Richard talked of visiting and company. He would have called his\r\nneighbours round us, and forced me to accept invitations at the various\r\nhouses where, in the shooting season, were assembled large parties of\r\nthe rich and gay. I earnestly assured him that my depressed spirits and\r\ndeep-rooted sorrow needed tranquillity\u2014that the seclusion which his\r\nhouse promised was its principal attraction\u2014that I was most happy to be\r\nalone. He could not believe my assertions; it hurt his feelings to leave\r\nme in this desert; he actually delayed his departure for two days, not\r\nliking to quit me. At last he went; and speedily, in the pursuit of\r\npleasure, forgot my existence.\r\n\r\nI was not absolutely alone in his house; my cousin Marianne inhabited it\r\nwith me. She was a pretty, agreeable girl, of twelve years of age; and\r\nwe got on very well together. I had recourse to her society when\r\nover-weary of thought; and she was so young that I could leave her, and\r\nbetake myself to my mournful, lonely reveries, whenever I liked, without\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\nI had not been at Beech Grove more than a week, when late one afternoon,\r\non returning from a drive, we distinguished lights in the dining-room.\r\n\u201cCan it be my brother?\u201d cried Marianne; \u201ccan Clinton have arrived?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope not,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, do not say so,\u201d replied the little girl; \u201cyou would love Clinton;\r\nhe is so lively and dear\u2014everybody loves him.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe scarce waited for the steps to be let down, but jumped from the\r\ncarriage. She returned to me in a minute with an air of disappointment,\r\n\u201cIt is only my brother Vernon,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you do not care about him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d she replied, \u201cVernon is very good, and all that; but he is\r\nquite different from Clinton; he may stay a month in the house and I not\r\nsee him twice.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe habit of solitude had rendered me a little bashful I had dined early\r\nwith my cousin, and the new-comer was at dinner. I went into the\r\ndrawing-room therefore, and made her stay with me, and awaited his\r\nentrance with some alarm. He soon joined us. As he entered, I was struck\r\nwith his being the handsomest man I had ever seen. His complexion was a\r\nclear olive; his eyes a dark blue; his head small and well shaped; his\r\nfigure scarcely above the middle size, but slender and elegant. I\r\nexpected the courteous manners of my uncle to correspond with the grace\r\nof his appearance; but Vernon had no vivacity, no softness. His words\r\nwere pregnant with meaning, and his eyes flashed fire as he spoke; but\r\nhis address was abrupt, his conversation pointed and sarcastic, and a\r\ndisagreeable ironical smile in which he indulged deteriorated greatly\r\nfrom his good looks. Still, he was very handsome, very clever, and very\r\nentertaining.\r\n\r\nOne part of Marianne\u2019s description at least was erroneous. He spent\r\nevery day and all day with us. He rode or walked with us in the morning;\r\nread to us in the evening; conversed as we worked or painted; and did\r\nall that a person most sedulous to please could do, except turning over\r\nthe leaves of our music-books. He did not like music\u2014of which my father\r\nwas so passionately fond; in all else his tastes seemed mine. He gave me\r\nItalian lessons; and, except when I drove him away, was never absent\r\nfrom our side. Marianne declared that her brother Vernon was an altered\r\nman. I thought that I knew whence the alteration sprung.\r\n\r\nWhat girl of eighteen, just emerged from solitude, could perceive the\r\nbirth of love in the heart of a young, accomplished, and handsome man,\r\nand not feel her vanity gratified? My peculiar education had prevented\r\nmy having any of the coquettishness of beauty or the insolence of\r\nwealth. I own I felt elated. I became of consequence in my own eyes; and\r\nmy silly heart swelled with conscious triumph. Vernon grew each day more\r\nopenly devoted to me, more solicitous to please, more flattering and\r\nattentive. He advanced with imperceptible steps to the desired bourne,\r\nand no impatience of temper disturbed for a moment his progress.\r\nStealthy as a serpent, and as wily, he became necessary to my comfort;\r\nand I had compromised myself by displaying my vain triumph in my\r\nconquest before he betrayed himself by a word.\r\n\r\nWhen I found that he sought a return for his love, I was frightened. I\r\ndiscovered that with all his talents and agreeable qualities I scarcely\r\nliked him, and certainly could never feel a sentiment more tender than\r\nfriendship. I reproached myself for my ingratitude\u2014I felt ashamed of my\r\nvacillation. He saw my struggles\u2014he was all humility\u2014he did not deserve\r\nbetter\u2014he was satisfied if I would only be a sister to him\u2014pity\r\nhim\u2014endure his presence. I agreed, and reassumed my familiarity and\r\ngood-humour.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe his refined artifice, or the wonderful\r\nassiduity with which he watched by his concealed net till I was\r\ncompletely immeshed. He contrived first that I should consent to listen\r\nto him talking of his passion; then he excited my pity for his\r\nsufferings\u2014he was eloquent in describing them and in exalting my merits.\r\nHe asked for so little, he seemed so humble; but he was importunate, and\r\nnever gave up the smallest advantage he had once gained. Forgotten by my\r\nuncle, unknown and unregarded by the rest of the world, I was delivered\r\nover to his machinations. Day after day he renewed them. He discerned\r\nand worked upon every weakness of my character. My fear to do wrong; my\r\nalarm at the idea of being the occasion of pain; my desire to preserve\r\nmy integrity without a flaw,\u2014these might be termed virtues; but,\r\ndistorted and exaggerated by natural conceit and youthful inexperience,\r\nthey rendered me a too easy prey. At last he extracted from me a promise\r\nto marry him when I should be of age. This pledge seemed the only method\r\nleft me to prove my delicacy and truth. I gave it the more readily\r\nbecause I admired his talents, and believed that he deserved a better\r\nwife than I, and that my want of love was a fault in me for which I\r\nought to compensate to him. With all the rashness and inexperience of my\r\nage, I confess that I even tried to conceal my latent aversion; so that\r\nwhen, after having obtained my promise, he went away for a week, I\r\nwillingly assented to his request that I should correspond with him, and\r\nmy letters were full of affection. I found it easier to write than speak\r\nwhat I did not really feel, and was glad to show my gratitude and my\r\nsense of his attachment at an easy rate. At the same time, I consented\r\nto keep our engagement secret, that thus I might have an excuse for\r\npreserving the reserve of my conduct. I took advantage of this wish on\r\nhis part to insist on his leaving me for a time. I was glad when he\r\nwent, yet mortified at the readiness of his obedience.\r\n\r\nI must not be unjust. Vernon had many faults, but coldness of feeling\r\nwas not among them. Vehemence and passion were his characteristics,\r\nthough he could unite them to a deliberation in design, and a wiliness\r\nin execution, without example. He had determined before he saw me to win\r\nme and my fortune; but such was the violence of his disposition, that he\r\nwas unavoidably caught in his own toils; and the project that was\r\nfounded on self-interest ended in making him the slave of love\u2014of a girl\r\nwhom he despised. He went when I bade him eagerly; but he fulfilled his\r\naim better by so doing. My letters were to be confirmations strong\r\nagainst me\u2014in case that hereafter, as he too justly feared, I should\r\nwish to retract my vows. I heedlessly accomplished his ends, beyond his\r\nmost sanguine expectations. My letters were those of a betrothed bride;\r\nand what they might want in tenderness was made up by their\r\nuncompromising acknowledgment of our relative position. Having obtained\r\nthese testimonies, he returned. I was not sorry. I was too little\r\npleased with myself to be in love with solitude. His presence kept alive\r\nthe feeling of irresistible fate to which I had yielded; and his society\r\nenlivened the monotonous quiet of Beech Grove.\r\n\r\nAt length Christmas came, and my uncle returned and filled his house\r\nwith visitors. Then the darker shades of Vernon\u2019s character became\r\napparent. He was as jealous as an Italian. His disposition was sombre\r\nand averse to sociable pleasures. God knows grief sat too heavy at my\r\nheart to allow me to be very vivacious; still, I wished to please my\r\nuncle, and thought that I had no right to cloud the good-humour of the\r\ncompany; and added to this was the elastic spirit of youth, which sprung\r\neagerly and spontaneously from the gloom and mystery of Vernon\u2019s\r\nartifices into the more congenial atmosphere of friendly intercourse. He\r\nsaw me unlike anything he had ever seen in me before\u2014sprightly, and\r\nready to share the amusement of the hour. He groaned in bitterness of\r\nspirit. He reproached\u2014reprehended\u2014and became a very taskmaster. I was\r\nnaturally timid and docile\u2014in vain did my spirit revolt from his\r\ninjustice: he gained and kept complete ascendency over me. Yet my soul\r\nwas in arms against him even while I submitted to his control, and\r\ndislike began to develop itself in my bosom. I tasked myself severely\r\nfor my ingratitude. I became in appearance kinder than ever; but every\r\ninternal struggle and every outward demonstration had unfortunately one\r\nresult\u2014to alienate my affections more and more from my lover-cousin.\r\n\r\nOur guests left us. My uncle went up to town. He told me he hoped I\r\nwould accompany him there as soon as Lady Hythe returned to chaperon me.\r\nBut I was more averse than ever to visiting London. Bound to Vernon by\r\nmy promises, and wishing to keep my faith with him, I did not like to\r\nexpose myself to the temptation of seeing others I should like better.\r\nBesides, the memory of my father was still unfaded, and I resolved not\r\nto appear in public till the year of mourning was expired. Vernon\r\naccompanied his father to town, but returned again to us almost\r\nimmediately. We appeared to revert to our former mode of life; but the\r\nessence of it was changed. He was moody\u2014I anxious. I almost ventured to\r\naccuse him of ill-temper and tyranny, till, reading in my own heart its\r\nindifference, I was inclined to consider myself the cause of his\r\ndiscontent. I tried to restore his complacency by kindness, and in some\r\ndegree succeeded.\r\n\r\nOne day Sir Richard suddenly appeared at Beech Grove. He seemed\r\nsurprised to find Vernon, and care and even anxiety clouded his usual\r\nhilarity. He told us that he expected Clinton daily, and should\r\nimmediately on his arrival bring him down to Hampshire.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo celebrate my birthday?\u201d asked Vernon, with a sardonic smile; \u201cI am\r\nof age on Friday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said his father; \u201che will not be here so soon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor I so honoured,\u201d said Vernon; \u201cClinton\u2019s coming of age was\r\ncelebrated by tumultuous rejoicings; but he is the Elder Son.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir Richard gave Vernon, who spoke sneeringly, a quick glance\u2014an\r\nindescribable expression of pain crossed his countenance.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you been staying here since Christmas?\u201d he asked at last. Vernon\r\nwould have replied evasively, but Marianne said,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes! he is always here now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou appear to have become very fond of Beech Grove of a sudden,\u201d\r\ncontinued his father. I felt that Sir Richard\u2019s eye was fixed on me as\r\nhe spoke, and I was conscious that not only my cheeks, but my temples\r\nand neck were crimsoned with blushes. Some time after I saw my uncle in\r\nthe shrubbery; he was alone, and the want of society was always so\r\npainful to him, that I thought it but a mark of duteous kindness to join\r\nhim. I wondered, as I approached, to see every token of haggard care on\r\na face usually so smiling. He saw me, and smoothed his brow; he began\r\ntalking of London, of my elder cousin, of his desire that I should\r\nconquer my timidity, and consent to be presented this spring. At length\r\nhe suddenly stopped short, and scrutinizing me as he spoke, said,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cPardon me, dear Ellen, if I annoy you; but I am your guardian, your\r\nsecond father\u2014am I not? Do not be angry, therefore, if I ask you, are\r\nyou attached to my son Vernon?\u201d\r\n\r\nMy natural frankness prompted one reply, but a thousand feelings,\r\ninexplicable but powerful, hung on my tongue. I answered, stammering:\r\n\u201cNo\u2014I believe so\u2014I like him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you do not love him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a question, dear uncle!\u201d I replied, covered with confusion.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it even so?\u201d cried Sir Richard; \u201cand is he to succeed in all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mistake,\u201d I said; for I had a horror of confessing an attachment\r\nwhich, after all, I did not feel, and so of making our engagement more\r\nbinding. But I blushed deeply as I spoke, and my uncle looked\r\nincredulous, and said,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYet it would make you very unhappy if he married another.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d I cried, \u201che has my free leave. I should wish him joy with all\r\nmy heart.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe idea\u2014the hope that he was playing me false, and might release me\r\nfrom my trammels, darted through my mind with a quick thrill of delight.\r\nSir Richard saw that I was in earnest, and his countenance cleared.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a strange thing is maiden coyness,\u201d he observed; \u201cyou blushed so\r\nprettily, Ellen, that I could have sworn you had given your heart to\r\nVernon. But I see I was mistaken; I am glad of it, for he would not suit\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\nNo more was said, but I felt conscience-stricken and miserable. I had\r\ndeceived my uncle, and yet I had not. I had declared that I did not love\r\nhim to whom I had pledged my hand; and the whole was a mystery and an\r\nentanglement that degraded me in my own eyes. I longed to make a full\r\nconfession; yet then all would be over\u2014we should both be inextricably\r\nbound. As it was, some caprice might cause Vernon to transfer his\r\naffection to another, and I could give him entire freedom, without any\r\nhuman being knowing how foolishly I had acted.\r\n\r\nWe had no guests at dinner; Sir Richard was to leave us early the next\r\nmorning. After dinner I speedily retired to the drawing-room, leaving\r\nfather and son together; they remained two hours. I was on the point of\r\nwithdrawing to my own room, to avoid a meeting which alarmed me, I knew\r\nnot why, when they entered. It seemed as if, in the interval of my\r\nabsence, they had received sudden intelligence of a dear friend\u2019s death;\r\nand yet not quite so, for though Vernon looked absorbed in thought, his\r\ngloom was strangely interspersed with glances of swelling triumph; his\r\nsmiles were no longer sneers\u2014yet they did not betray a sunshine of the\r\nheart, but rather joy on a bad victory. He looked on me askance, with a\r\nkind of greedy satisfaction, and at his father with scorn. I trembled,\r\nand turned to my uncle; but sadness and confusion marked his features\u2014he\r\nwas stamped as with disgrace, and quailed beneath my eye; though\r\npresently he rallied, drew a chair near, and was kinder than ever. He\r\ntold me that he was going up to town on the morrow, and that Vernon was\r\nto accompany him; he asked me if there was anything he could do for me,\r\nand testified his affection by a thousand little attentions. Vernon said\r\nnothing, and took leave of me so coldly, that I thought his manner\r\nimplied that he expected to see me in the morning. Thinking it right to\r\nindulge him, I rose early; but he did not come down till long after Sir\r\nRichard, who thanked me for my kindness in disturbing myself on his\r\naccount. They went away immediately after breakfast, and Vernon\u2019s formal\r\nadieu again struck me with wonder. Was it possible that he was indeed\r\ngoing to marry another? This doubt was all my comfort, for I was\r\npainfully agitated by the false position in which I had entangled\r\nmyself, by the mystery that enveloped my actions, and the falsehood\r\nwhich my lips perpetually implied, if they did not utter.\r\n\r\nI was habitually an early riser. On the third morning after the\r\ndeparture of my relations, before I rose, and while I was dressing, I\r\nthought that pebbles were thrown at my window; but my mind was too\r\nengrossed to pay attention, till at last, after my toilette had been\r\nleisurely completed, I looked from my window, and saw Vernon below, in\r\nthe secluded part of the park which it overlooked. I hurried down, my\r\nheart palpitating with anxiety.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been waiting for you these two hours,\u201d he said angrily; \u201cdid you\r\nnot hear my signal?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know of no signal,\u201d I replied; \u201cI am not accustomed to clandestine\r\nappointments.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet you can carry on a clandestine engagement excellently well! You\r\ntold Sir Richard that you did not love me\u2014that you should be glad if I\r\nmarried another.\u201d\r\n\r\nAn indignant reply was bursting from my lips, but he saw the rising\r\nstorm and hastened to allay it. He changed his tone at once from\r\nreproach to tender protestations.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt broke my heart to leave you as I did,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I could do no\r\nless. Sir Richard insisted on my accompanying him\u2014I was obliged to\r\ncomply. Even now he believes me to be in town. I have travelled all\r\nnight. He half-suspected me, because I refused to dine with him to-day;\r\nand I was forced to promise to join him at a ball to-night. I need not\r\nbe there till twelve or one, and so can stay two hours with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why this hurried journey?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy do you come?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe answered by pleading the vehemence of his affection, and spoke of the\r\nrisk he ran of losing me for ever. \u201cDo you not know,\u201d he said, \u201cthat my\r\nfather has set his heart upon your marrying my brother?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is very good,\u201d I replied disdainfully. \u201cBut I am not a slave, to be\r\nbought and sold. My cousin Clinton is the last person in the world whom\r\nyou need fear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Ellen, how much do you comfort\u2014transport me, by this generous\r\ncontempt for wealth and rank! You ask why I am here\u2014it were worth the\r\nfatigue, twice ten thousand times told, to have these assurances. I have\r\ntrembled\u2014I have feared\u2014but you will not love this favoured of\r\nfortune\u2014this elder son!\u201d\r\n\r\nI cannot describe Vernon\u2019s look as he said this. Methought envy, malice,\r\nand demoniac exultation were all mingled. He laughed aloud\u2014I shrunk from\r\nhim dismayed. He became calmer a moment after.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy life is in your hands, Ellen,\u201d he said;\u2014but why repeat his glossing\r\nspeeches, in which deceit and truth were so kneaded into one mass, that\r\nthe poison took the guise of the wholesome substance, while the whole\r\nwas impregnated with destruction. I felt that I liked him less than\r\never; yet I yielded to his violence. I believed myself the victim of a\r\nvenial but irreparable mistake of my own. I confirmed my promises, and\r\npledged my faith most solemnly. It is true that I undeceived him as much\r\nas I could with regard to the extent of my attachment; at first he was\r\nfurious at my coldness, then overwhelmed me with entreaties for\r\nforgiveness\u2014tears even streamed from his eyes\u2014and then again he\r\nhaughtily reminded me that I forfeited every virtue of my sex, and\r\nbecame a monument of falsehood, if I failed him. We separated at last\u2014I\r\npromised to write every day, and saw him ride away with a sensation as\r\nif relieved from the infliction of the torture.\r\n\r\nA week after this scene\u2014my spirits still depressed, and often weeping my\r\ndear father\u2019s death, which I considered the root of every evil\u2014I was\r\nreading, or rather trying to read, in my dressing-room, but in reality\r\nbrooding over my sorrows, when I heard Marianne\u2019s cheerful laugh in the\r\nshrubbery, and her voice calling me to join her. I roused myself from my\r\nsad reverie, and resolved to cast aside care and misery, while Vernon\u2019s\r\nabsence afforded me a shadow of freedom; and, in fulfilment of this\r\ndetermination, went down to join my young light-hearted cousin. She was\r\nnot alone. Clinton was with her. There was no resemblance between him\r\nand Vernon. His countenance was all sunshine; his light-blue eyes\r\nlaughed in their own gladness and purity; his beaming smile, his\r\nsilver-toned voice, his tall, manly figure, and, above all, his\r\nopen-hearted engaging manners, were all the reverse of his dark\r\nmysterious brother. I saw him, and felt that my prejudices had been\r\nridiculous; we became intimate in a moment. I know not how it was, but\r\nwe seemed like brother and sister\u2014each feeling, each thought, being laid\r\nbare to the other. I was naturally frank, but rendered timid by\r\neducation; so that it charmed me doubly when the unreserve of another\r\ninvited me to indulge in the unguarded confidence of my disposition. How\r\nspeedily the days now flew! they contained but one drawback, my\r\ncorrespondence with my cousin\u2014not that I felt myself unfaithful towards\r\nhim; my affection for my new-found relation did not disturb my\r\nconscience\u2014that was pure, undisguised, sisterly. We had met from across\r\nthe ocean of life\u2014two beings who formed a harmonized whole; but the\r\nsympathy was too perfect, too untinged by earthly dross, to be compared\r\nwith the selfish love given and exacted by Vernon. Yet I feared that his\r\njealousy might be awakened, while I felt less inclined than ever to\r\nbelie my own heart; and with aversion and hesitation penned letters\r\ncontaining the formula of affection and engaged vows.\r\n\r\nSir Richard came down to Beech Grove. He was highly pleased to see the\r\ncordial friendship that subsisted between his son and me.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid I not tell you that you would like him?\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery one must,\u201d I replied; \u201che is formed to win all hearts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd suits you much better than Vernon?\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not know what to answer; it was a tender string that he touched;\r\nbut I resolved not to feel or think. Sir Richard\u2019s were all flying\r\nvisits; he was to leave us in the evening. He had, during the morning, a\r\nlong conversation with Clinton; and immediately after he sought for an\r\nopportunity to talk to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cEllen,\u201d he said, \u201cI have not been a wise but I am a fond father. I have\r\ndone Clinton many injuries, of which he, poor fellow, is wholly\r\nunconscious; and I have wished to compensate for all in giving him a\r\nwife worthy of him. His temper is generous; his spirit clear and noble.\r\nBy my soul, I think he has every virtue under heaven; and you alone\r\ndeserve him. Do not interrupt me, I beseech you; hear me this once. I\r\nconfess that ever since you became my ward this has been my favourite\r\nproject. There have been several obstacles; but the most serious ones\r\nseem to vanish. You have seen each other, and I flatter myself have each\r\ndiscovered and appreciated the good qualities of the other. Is it so,\r\nEllen? I know not whence my fears arise, and yet they intrude\r\nthemselves. I fear, while I have been endeavouring to secure my boy\u2019s\r\nhappiness, I may have been adding to the ruin already heaped on his head\r\nby my means. I have talked with him to-day. He has no disguise in his\r\nnature, and he avows that he loves you. I know that this confession\r\nwould come better from himself; but your fortune, your beauty, make him\r\nfear to be misinterpreted. Do not mistake\u2014he is wholly unaware of my\r\nintention of speaking to you. I see your distress, dear Ellen; have\r\npatience but for one word more\u2014do not trifle with Clinton\u2019s feelings, as\r\nsometimes\u2014forgive me\u2014it has appeared to me that you have trifled with\r\nVernon\u2019s\u2014do not foster hopes not to be fulfilled. Be frank, be honest,\r\ndespite the bashfulness and coquetry of your sex.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter these words, fearful of having offended\u2014overcome by more agitation\r\nthan I could have imagined him capable of feeling\u2014my uncle drew me\r\ntowards him, pressed me convulsively to his bosom, and then rushed from\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nI cannot describe the state in which he left me\u2014a spasm of pain passed\r\nthrough my frame; I became sick and faint, till a flood of tears\r\nrelieved my bursting heart. I wept long\u2014I sobbed in agony\u2014I felt the\r\nveriest wretch that ever trod the earth.\r\n\r\nMy uncle had rent the veil that concealed me from myself. I loved\r\nClinton\u2014he was the whole world to me\u2014all the world of light and joy, and\r\nI had shut myself out from him for ever. And he also was my victim. I\r\nbeheld his dear face beaming with hope; I heard his thrilling voice\r\nharmonized by love; and saw the fearless cordiality of his manners,\r\nwhich bespoke his confidence in my sympathy; while I knew that I held a\r\npoisoned dagger which I was about to plunge into his heart. Sometimes I\r\nthought to treat him coldly, sometimes\u2014oh! I cannot tell the various\r\nimaginations that haunted me\u2014some self-sacrificing, others wicked and\r\nfalse\u2014all ended in one way. My uncle departed; we were left together,\r\nour full hearts beating to respond to each other without any division or\r\nreserve. I felt that every moment might cause Clinton to open his soul\r\nto me, and to seek in mine for a feeling too truly and too fondly alive\r\nthere, but which was sinful and fatal to both. To prevent his\r\nconfession, my own preceded it. I revealed to him my engagement to\r\nVernon, and declared my resolve not to swerve from my faith. He\r\ncommended me. I saw despair at losing me painted in his countenance,\r\nmingled with horror at supplanting his brother; and alarm that he, the\r\nelder born, gifted by fortune with every blessing, should be suspected\r\nof the intention of stealing the sole remaining good, which Vernon had\r\nwon by his diligence, perhaps by his deserts. Forbid it, Heaven! I saw\r\nin the clear mirror of his expressive countenance the struggle of\r\npassion and principle, and the triumph of honour and virtue exalted over\r\nthe truest love that ever warmed man\u2019s breast.\r\n\r\nOur gaiety was flown; our laughter stilled. We talked sadly and\r\nseriously together, neither lamenting our fate nor acknowledging our\r\nsufferings; tamed to endurance, and consoling each other by such\r\ndemonstrations of affection as were permitted to our near relationship.\r\nWe read clearly each other\u2019s hearts, and supported each other in the\r\njoint sacrifice; and this without any direct acknowledgment. Clinton\r\ntalked of returning to the Continent; I of my seclusion and tranquillity\r\nat Beech Grove. The time was distant\u2014two years was an eternity at our\r\nage\u2014before Vernon could claim my hand; and we did not advert to that\r\nfatal consummation. We gave up each other; and that single misery\r\nsufficed without a more cruel addition. I was calm, pale, and tearless.\r\nI had brought it all on myself, and must submit. I could not cast aside\r\nthe younger son to select the elder; and if in my secret thoughts I\r\ncherished a hope to induce Vernon to forego his claims, that very\r\ncircumstance would the more entirely divide me from Clinton. As my\r\nbrother-in-law, I might see him\u2014in some sort, our fortunes were shared;\r\nbut as a rival to Vernon, a stream of blood separated us for ever.\r\n\r\nThe hours of sad sympathy which we passed were very dear to us. We knew\r\nthat they were brief. Clinton had fixed the day and hour of his\r\ndeparture\u2014each moment it drew nearer. We should never meet again till\r\nafter my marriage; but till the hour of separation, for two short days,\r\nwe were all in all to each other, despite the wall of adamant which was\r\nraised between us. We tried each to pretend to think and talk of\r\nindifferent subjects; and we _never_ spoke of that nearest our\r\nhearts;\u2014but how superfluous are words as interpreters between lovers! As\r\nwe walked or rode, and spent hours in each other\u2019s society, we exchanged\r\nthoughts more intimately during long periods of absolute silence, than\r\nVernon with his vehemence and eloquence could have conceived. Had we\r\nspoken folio volumes, we could have said no more. Our looks\u2014the very\r\ncasting down of our eyes and mutual tacit avoidance, told our resolve to\r\nfulfil our duties and to conquer our love; and yet how, by a glance or a\r\nfaltering word, when the future was alluded to, did we promise never to\r\nforget, but to cherish mutual esteem and tenderness as all that was left\r\nof the paradise from which we were so ruthlessly driven! Now and then a\r\nplayful expression on his part, or a blush on mine, betrayed more\r\nfeeling than we considered right; the one was checked by a sigh, the\r\nother by an assumption of indifference.\r\n\r\nI had been spending many hours in tears and anguish, when, resolved to\r\novercome my weakness, and to recover an appearance of serenity before my\r\ncousin returned from his ride, I went into Marianne\u2019s schoolroom and\r\ntook up a book. The exhaustion of weeping had calmed me; and I thought\r\nof my kinsman\u2014his endearing qualities, and of the tie between us, with\r\nsoftened feelings. As I indulged in reverie, my head resting on my hand,\r\nmy book falling from my fingers, my eyes closed, I passed from the\r\nagitated sense of life and sorrow into the balmy forgetfulness of sleep.\r\nClinton had wished to make a portrait of me, yet had not ventured to ask\r\nme to sit\u2014he came in at this moment; Marianne, whispering, told him not\r\nto disturb me. He took her drawing materials, and made a hasty sketch,\r\nwhich genius and love united to render a perfect likeness. I awoke and\r\nsaw his work; it was beyond our contract; I asked him for it; he felt\r\nthat I was right, and gave it. This sacrifice on his part proved that he\r\ndid not palter with his sense of right. On the morrow we were to part;\r\nand he would preserve no memorial beyond a remembrance which he could\r\nnot destroy.\r\n\r\nThat morrow came. Clinton asked me and his sister to walk through the\r\npark with him, to join his chariot at the farther lodge. We consented;\r\nbut, at the moment of going, Marianne, who knew nothing certainly, but\r\nwho darkly guessed that all was not right, excused herself. I joined him\r\nalone. There was something in his person and manner that so promised\r\nprotection and tenderness, that I felt it doubly hard to be torn from\r\nhim. A dignified reserve, foreign to his usual nature, founded on a\r\nresolve to play only the brother\u2019s part, checked me somewhat; yet I\r\nloved him the more for it; while I would have laid down my existence so\r\nthat it had only been permitted us to throw aside the mask but for one\r\nshort hour, and to use the language of nature and troth. It could not\r\nbe; and our conversation was upon indifferent subjects. When we\r\napproached the lodge, we found that the chariot had not come, and we\r\nretreated a little, and sat down on a turfy bank; then Clinton said a\r\nfew words, the only ones that at all revealed the agitation he was\r\nenduring.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have a little more experience than you, Ellen,\u201d he said; \u201cand,\r\nbesides, I am haunted by strange presentiments; we seem to know what we\r\nought to do, and what we are to do, and act accordingly\u2014yet life is a\r\nstrange, wild thing. I wish to ensure for you a friend more willing and\r\nactive than Sir Richard. I have a sister to whom I am fondly attached;\r\nshe is now on the Continent, but I shall hasten to her, and entreat her\r\nto afford you a friendship you so richly deserve. You will love Lady\r\nHythe for her own sake as well as for mine.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was desirous of thanking him for this mark of kindness, but my voice\r\nfailed me, and I burst into tears, overcome by the excess of anguish\r\nthat deluged my heart I tried to conceal my tears\u2014I could not.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not, Ellen, dear Ellen, I beseech you\u2014command yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nClinton spoke in a voice so broken, so full of misery, that he inspired\r\nme at once with fear and courage. The tread of a horse roused us\u2014a horse\r\nat swift gallop. I raised my eyes, and uttered a shriek; for, reining in\r\nthe animal with a sudden strong pull, Vernon halted close to us. The\r\nmost violent passions convulsed his countenance. He threw himself from\r\nthe horse, and, casting the bridle from him, came up. What he meant to\r\nsay or do I cannot tell; perhaps to conceal the workings of his\r\nheart\u2014and the quick departure of Clinton would have smoothed all; but I\r\nsaw the barrel of a pistol peep from the pocket of his coat. I was\r\nseized with terror\u2014I shrieked aloud. Clinton, terrified at my alarm,\r\nwould have supported me, but Vernon pushed him rudely away.\r\n\r\n\u201cDare not to approach or touch her, as you value your life!\u201d he cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy life! you talk idly, Vernon. I value her security\u2014one moment of\r\npeace to her\u2014far more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou confess it!\u201d exclaimed Vernon; \u201cand you, too, false and treacherous\r\ngirl! Ha! did you think to betray me, and be unpunished? Do you think,\r\nif I so chose it, that I would not force you to look on till the blood\r\nof one of the brothers flowed at your feet? But there are other\r\npunishments in store for you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe expressions of menace used towards myself restored my courage, and I\r\nexclaimed, \u201cBeware that you do not break the tie that binds us\u2014at least,\r\nthat bound us a moment ago\u2014perhaps it is already broken.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoubtless,\u201d he cried, grinding his teeth with rage, \u201cit is broken, and\r\na new one created to bind you to the elder son. Oh yes! you would fain\r\ncast aside the poor, miserable beggar, who has vainly fawned on you, and\r\nmadly loved\u2014you would take the rich, the honourable, and honoured Sir\r\nClinton! Base, hollow-hearted fool!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVernon,\u201d said Clinton, \u201cwhatever your claims are on our cousin, I\r\ncannot stand by and see her insulted. You forget yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe forgetfulness, sir, is on your part; proud in your seniority, to\r\nrival your brother, to drive him from his all, has been a May-game for\r\nyou; but know, proud fool, or villain\u2014take which name you will\u2014your hour\r\nis passed by\u2014your reign at an end! Your station is a fiction, your very\r\nexistence a disgrace!\u201d\r\n\r\nClinton and I both began to think that Vernon was really mad\u2014a suspicion\r\nconfirmed by his violent gestures. We looked at each other in alarm.\r\n\r\n\u201cStay!\u201d exclaimed the infuriated man, seizing my arm with a fierce\r\ngrasp; while, fearful to induce Clinton\u2019s interference, I yielded.\r\n\u201cStay, and listen to what your lover is\u2014or shall I wound your delicate\r\nears? There are soft phrases and silken words to adorn that refuse of\r\nthe world\u2014a bastard!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVernon, dare not!\u2014beware, sir, and begone!\u201d\r\n\r\nClinton\u2019s face crimsoned; his voice, his majestic indignation almost\r\nforced the ruffian to quail; he threw my arm from him.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake him, fair Ellen! it is true you take what I say\u2014a natural son. Do\r\nyou think that my information is not correct? Ask our father, for he is\r\nyours, Clinton, and our mother is the same; you are the first-born of\r\nRichard Gray and Matilda Towers; but I am the eldest son of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nGray.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt could not have been that Vernon would have acted this cowardly and\r\nfoolish part had he not been driven by a kind of madness. In truth, Sir\r\nRichard had, to quench his hopes for ever, with that carelessness of\r\ntruth\u2014his fatal propensity\u2014affirmed that Clinton and I were acknowledged\r\nlovers; and he came goaded by worse than jealousy\u2014by a spirit of hatred\r\nand revenge. Seeing us together, obviously engaged by the most\r\nengrossing feelings, his temper, which had been worked into fury during\r\nhis journey, burst forth beyond the bounds he had prescribed for\r\nhimself. I have called him a serpent, and such he was in every respect;\r\nhe could crawl and coil, and hide his wily advance; but he could erect\r\nhis crest, dart out his forked tongue, and infix the deadly venom, when\r\nroused as he now was. Clinton turned alternately pale and red.\r\n\r\n\u201cBe it as you will,\u201d he said; \u201cmy fortunes and yours are of slight\r\nmoment in comparison to Ellen\u2019s safety. If there is any truth in this\r\ntale of yours, there will be time enough to discover it and to act upon\r\nit. Meanwhile, dear cousin, I see they have brought my chariot to the\r\nlodge. You cannot walk home\u2014get into it; it will drive you to the house,\r\nand come back for me.\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked at him inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not fear to be deserted by me,\u201d he said, \u201cor that I shall do\r\nanything rashly. Vernon must accompany me to town\u2014to our father\u2019s\r\npresence, there to expiate this foul calumny, or to prove it. Be assured\r\nhe shall not approach you without your leave. I will watch over him, and\r\nguard you.\u201d\r\n\r\nClinton spoke aloud, and Vernon became aware that he must yield to this\r\narrangement, and satisfied that he had divided us. Clinton led me to his\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will hear soon from some one of us, Ellen,\u201d he said; \u201cand let me\r\nimplore you to be patient\u2014to take care of yourself\u2014to fear nothing. I\r\ncan make no remark\u2014affirm, deny nothing now; but you shall not be kept\r\nin suspense. Promise me to be patient and calm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd do you,\u201d I said at last, commanding my trembling voice, \u201cpromise\r\nnot to be rash; and promise not to leave England without seeing me\r\nagain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI promise not to leave England for any time without your leave. Oh,\r\ntrust me, my dear cousin; it is not in such storms as these that you\r\nshall be ashamed of me; one sentiment may subdue me, but poverty,\r\ndisgrace, and every angry passion I can master.\u201d\r\n\r\nVernon did not dare interrupt us. He felt that he had destroyed his\r\ncarefully woven web through his own rashness, and gnawed his lips in\r\nsilent rage. I looked at him once, and turned away my eyes in contempt.\r\nI got into the chariot; it drove me to the house, and went back to take\r\nClinton up to town. Thus we were separated, as we intended; and yet, how\r\ndifferently! Hope was reborn in my heart, out of the very ashes of its\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nTwo mortal days passed, and I was still in my solitude, receiving no\r\nintelligence, except, indeed, such as was contained in a letter from\r\nVernon. In this he demanded me as a right, and fiercely insisted that I\r\nshould keep my faith with him; but he did not allude to the scene in the\r\npark, nor to his strange assertions there. I threw the letter from me as\r\nunworthy of notice or thought. The third morning brought me one from my\r\nuncle. I tore it open with uncontrollable impatience: these were the\r\ncontents:\u2014\r\n\r\n    \u201cClinton, my dear Ellen, insists that I should join you at Beech\r\n    Grove; but I cannot persuade myself to do so till I have your\r\n    leave\u2014till I have confessed my villainy, and besought your\r\n    forgiveness, in addition to that of my noble-hearted boy, whom I\r\n    devoted to ruin before his birth, and who has pardoned me. It is a\r\n    hateful subject\u2014unfit for your ears, my gentle, virtuous girl, and I\r\n    must hurry it over. When I first knew Miss Towers, I had no idea of\r\n    marrying her; for she was poor and of humble birth. We loved each\r\n    other, and she was willing to become mine on my own terms. Our\r\n    intercourse was betrayed to her parents; and to appease them, and\r\n    please Matilda, I declared that we were married. My assertion was\r\n    credited; Matilda assumed my name, and all the world, all her little\r\n    world, was deceived; while at the same time I declared to my father\r\n    that she was merely my mistress. He did not believe me. Thus I\r\n    became entangled. A little before the birth of our second boy my\r\n    father died, and my grandfather offered me two thousand a year on\r\n    condition that I would secure the whole estate to my eldest son. I\r\n    loved Matilda; my fears were dissipated by my father\u2019s death, and by\r\n    this acknowledgment of my union by my grandfather. I married her;\r\n    and, three days after Vernon\u2019s birth, signed the settlement of\r\n    entail. Such is my story. Lady Gray\u2019s character necessitated the\r\n    concealment from every human being of the period when the marriage\r\n    was celebrated. My noble, beloved Clinton assumed the elder son\u2019s\r\n    place. I dared not reveal the truth; nay, I fancied that I benefited\r\n    him by allowing him to fill this false position till my death. He\r\n    has undeceived me; but he has not cursed me. From the moment I saw\r\n    you, I designed that you should repair my faults towards him, as you\r\n    alone could. I believed that you were formed for each other; I was\r\n    not mistaken there. I meant to acknowledge all before your marriage,\r\n    but I believed that if once your affections were engaged, you would\r\n    not reject my son from base and worldly-minded considerations. Am I\r\n    not right also in this? Meanwhile, Clinton was abroad, and I became\r\n    uneasy at observing the pains which Vernon took to ingratiate\r\n    himself with you, and the intimacy which you encouraged. I forbade\r\n    him to remain with you at Beech Grove\u2014he defied me. Then I tried to\r\n    entice him away from you; and, as a last bribe, disclosed the secret\r\n    of his birth: he, in return, promised to leave the field open to\r\n    Clinton. You know the rest. He never meant to give you up; he was my\r\n    heir, and he grasped at your fortune besides\u2014shall he succeed?\r\n    Clinton is all kindness, and soothing angelic goodness\u2014but he\r\n    insists on no longer filling a situation to which he has no claim,\r\n    and\u2014is gone abroad. He fears to leave you exposed to Vernon\u2019s\r\n    violence, and has made me promise to go down to Beech Grove, and to\r\n    prevent his brother from seeing you without your free and entire\r\n    consent. As I have said, I cannot prevail on myself to visit you\r\n    till you are in full possession of all the facts. Now they are in\r\n    your hands. You may expect me to-morrow. Do not fear Vernon; I will\r\n    take care that he shall not commit further outrage on you, nor\r\n    injure the interest which I fondly trust that you preserve for my\r\n    godlike, my beloved Clinton.\u201d\r\n\r\nI read and reread this letter a thousand times; my soul was in tumults.\r\nAt first I could only think of the facts that it contained, and proudly\r\nand joyfully determined to compensate to Clinton, as I believed I could,\r\nfor every evil; and then again I read the letter, and many parts of it\r\nfilled me with wonder and dismay. Clinton was gone abroad\u2014against his\r\npromise\u2014without a word; and there was something so indelicate in the way\r\nin which my uncle espoused his cause. It was strange\u2014unlike any conduct\r\nI had expected on my dear cousin\u2019s part. Of course he would write\u2014and\r\nyet he was gone, and no letter came! And then I dreaded to see Sir\r\nRichard, the wrongful, penitent father: the total indifference which he\r\ndisplayed to moral principle\u2014not founded, like Vernon\u2019s, on selfishness,\r\nbut on weakness of character and natural callousness to truth\u2014revolted\r\nme. Where was my own dear father? He had thrown me from the sacred\r\nshelter of his virtue into a system of dissimulation and guilt, which\r\neven Clinton, I thought, deserting me as he did, did not redeem. I\r\nstruggled with these feelings, but their justice confounded and overcame\r\nme. Yet, even in the midst of these disquieting reflections, a deep\r\nsense of happiness pervaded my soul. The mystery, the tyranny which had\r\nenveloped me, was brushed away like a spider\u2019s web. I was free\u2014I might\r\nfollow the dictates of my feelings, and it was no longer sin to love him\r\nto whom my heart was irrevocably given. The hours of the day flew on,\r\nwhile I lived as in a dream, absorbed by wonder, hope, doubt, and joy.\r\nAt length, at six in the evening, a carriage drove up the avenue; a kind\r\nof terror at the expectation of seeing my uncle seized me, and I\r\nretreated hastily to my own room, gasping for breath. In a few minutes\r\nmy servant tapped at my door; she told me that it was Lady Hythe who had\r\narrived, and delivered me a letter. The letter was from Clinton; it was\r\ndated the same day, in London. I pressed it passionately to my lips and\r\nheart, and devoured its contents with eagerness. \u201cAt length, dear\r\nEllen,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI am satisfied; I was long uneasy on your account. I\r\nbesought my father to go down to you, yet even that did not content\r\nme\u2014for you did not so much need protection as sympathy and true\r\ndisinterested friendship. My thoughts turned towards my earliest and\r\ndearest friend, my sister Caroline. She was on the Continent\u2014I set out\r\nimmediately to meet her, to tell everything, and to ask her advice and\r\nassistance. Fortune befriended me\u2014I found her at Calais\u2014she is now with\r\nyou. She is my better self. Her delicacy of character, her accurate\r\njudgment and warm heart, joined to her position as a woman, married to\r\nthe best and most generous fellow breathing, render her the very person\r\nto whom I can intrust your happiness. I do not speak of myself\u2014fortune\r\ncannot overcome my spirits, and my way is clear before me. I pity my\r\nfather and family; but Caroline will explain to you better than I can my\r\nviews and hopes. Adieu, dear cousin! Heaven bless you as you deserve!\r\nYour fortitude, I am sure, has not deserted you; yet I am very anxious\r\nto hear that your health has not suffered by my brother\u2019s violence.\r\nCaroline will write to me, and rejoice me by telling me of your\r\nwell-being.\u201d\r\n\r\nI hurried down immediately to welcome Clinton\u2019s sister; and from that\r\nmoment my perplexities and sorrows vanished. Lady Hythe was a feminine\r\nlikeness of Clinton; the same active kindness of heart, gentleness of\r\ntemper, and adorable frankness. We were friends and sisters on the\r\ninstant, and her true affection repaid me for every suffering; none of\r\nwhich I should have experienced had she been in England on my arrival.\r\nClinton had told her of his love, but left me to reveal my own\r\nsentiments, detailing only the artifices and jealousy of Vernon. I was\r\nwithout disguise, for we were all one family, with the same objects,\r\nhopes, and pleasures. We went up to town immediately, and there I saw\r\nClinton, and we exchanged our reserved, sad intercourse for a full\r\nacknowledgment of every thought and feeling.\r\n\r\nThe only piece of prudence that Sir Richard had practised was placing\r\nClinton in the army, and purchasing promotion for him. He was so beloved\r\nby his fellow-officers that, on the discovery of his unfortunate birth,\r\nthey all united in giving him the support of their friendship and good\r\nopinion. Clinton resolved, therefore, to enter at once on active\r\nservice, and to follow up his profession with energy. Two years were to\r\nelapse before I could marry, and he expressed a wish that we should\r\nneither of us consider ourselves under any engagement. How vain are such\r\nwords! Heaven designed us for each other, and the mere phrase of\r\nengagement or freedom could not affect a tie founded on affection,\r\nesteem, or, beyond this, the passion that caused us to find happiness in\r\neach other only. He went with his regiment to Ireland, and we were a\r\ngood deal divided during the two years that elapsed before I was\r\ntwenty-one. I continued to reside with Lady Hythe, and enjoyed with her\r\nthat peace of mind which true friendship affords.\r\n\r\nAt length the day came when I completed my twenty-first year. Sir\r\nRichard had wished to be present at our nuptials, but was unable from\r\nill-health. I went to him, and saw him for the first time since the\r\nfatal discovery; for, on finding that I was happily placed with his\r\ndaughter, he had carefully avoided seeing me. His character, indeed, was\r\nwholly changed. While carrying on a system of dissimulation, he had\r\nappeared gay; he was extravagant; given up to pleasure, and spending\r\neven beyond his large income, despite the ruin in which he knew that his\r\nson would be involved on his death. He made him indeed a princely\r\nallowance, as if that was to compensate to him; while, in fact, Clinton\r\nwas only thus habituated to expense. As soon as the discovery was made,\r\nSir Richard, by one of those inconceivable changes which sometimes occur\r\nin the history of human nature, set his heart on saving a fortune for\r\nhis beloved boy. He thought that I might be fickle; he feared his own\r\ndeath and the loss of power to benefit him. He gave up his establishment\r\nin town\u2014he let Beech Grove\u2014he saved every farthing that he could, and\r\nwas enabled to settle twenty thousand pounds on Clinton on the day of\r\nour marriage.\r\n\r\nI went to see him in a little lodging at Camberwell, whither he had\r\nretreated. He was emaciated and ill; his eyes brightened a little on\r\nseeing Clinton and me together.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would fain live a little longer,\u201d he said, \u201cto increase my son\u2019s\r\nfortune; but God\u2019s will be done\u2014you will make him happy, Ellen.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe were inexpressibly shocked. He had concealed his penurious style of\r\nlife and declining health all this time; and nothing but his illness,\r\nand our insisting upon seeing him, caused him to betray it now. Our\r\nfirst care after our marriage was to oblige him to take up his abode\r\nwith us; and we devoted ourselves to calming his remorse and smoothing\r\nhis path to the grave. He survived only four months; but he had the\r\ncomfort of knowing that Clinton was satisfied and happy; and that we\r\nboth from our hearts forgave the errors which he at last expiated so\r\ndearly.\r\n\r\nWe never saw Vernon again; nor can I tell what has happened to him,\r\nexcept that he lives the life of the rich in England, apparently\r\nattended by prosperity. Lady Hythe stood between me and him, and\r\nscreened me from his violence and reproaches. He has never married. I\r\nhave never seen him since the day when, in the park at Beech Grove, he\r\nunawares conferred on me every blessing of life, by releasing me from\r\nthe ties that bound me to him.\r\n\r\nThe happiness of Clinton and myself has been unclouded. I at last\r\npersuaded him to give up his profession, and we live principally abroad.\r\nLord and Lady Hythe frequently visit us; and every event of our\r\nlives\u2014the unimportant events of domestic life\u2014tends to increase our\r\nprosperity, and the entire affection we cherish for each other.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XVII.\r\n\r\n                            _THE PILGRIMS._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE twilight of one of those burning days of summer whose unclouded sky\r\nseems to speak to man of happier realms, had already flung broad shadows\r\nover the valley of Unspunnen; whilst the departing rays of a gorgeous\r\nsunset continued to glitter on the summits of the surrounding hills.\r\nGradually, however, the glowing tints deepened; then grew darker and\r\ndarker; until they finally yielded to the still more sober hues of\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nBeneath an avenue of lime-trees, which, from their size and luxuriance,\r\nappeared almost coeval with the soil in which they grew, Burkhardt of\r\nUnspunnen wandered to and fro with uneasy step, as if some recent sorrow\r\noccupied his troubled mind. At times he stood with his eyes stedfastly\r\nfixed on the earth, as if he expected to see the object of his\r\ncontemplation start forth from its bosom; at other times he would raise\r\nhis eyes to the summits of the trees, whose branches, now gently\r\nagitated by the night breeze, seemed to breathe sighs of compassion in\r\nremembrance of those happy hours which had once been passed beneath\r\ntheir welcome shade. When, however, advancing from beneath them, he\r\nbeheld the deep blue heavens with the bright host of stars, hope sprang\r\nup within him at the thoughts of that glory to which those heavens and\r\nthose stars, all lovely and beauteous as they seem, are but the faint\r\nheralds, and for a time dissipated the grief which had so long weighed\r\nheavily upon his heart.\r\n\r\nFrom these reflections he was suddenly aroused by the tones of a manly\r\nvoice addressing him. Burkhardt advancing, beheld, standing in the light\r\nof the moon, two pilgrims, clothed in the usual coarse and sombre garb,\r\nwith their broad hats drawn over their brows.\r\n\r\n\u201cPraise be to God!\u201d said the pilgrim who had just before awakened\r\nBurkhardt\u2019s attention, and who, from his height and manner, appeared to\r\nbe the elder of the two. His words were echoed by a voice whose gentle\r\nand faultering accents showed the speaker to be still but of tender\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhither are you going, friends? what seek you here, at this late hour?\u201d\r\nsaid Burkhardt. \u201cIf you wish to rest you after your journey enter, and\r\nwith God\u2019s blessing, and my hearty welcome, recruit yourselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNoble sir, you have more than anticipated our petition,\u201d replied the\r\nelder pilgrim; \u201cour duty has led us far from our native land, being\r\nbound on a pilgrimage to fulfil the vow of a beloved parent. We have\r\nbeen forced during the heat of the day to climb the steep mountain\r\npaths; and the strength of my brother, whose youth but ill befits him\r\nfor such fatigues, began to fail, when the sight of your castle\u2019s\r\ntowers, which the moon\u2019s clear beams discovered to us, revived our\r\nhopes. We resolved to beg a night\u2019s lodging under your hospitable roof,\r\nthat we might be enabled, on to-morrow\u2019s dawn, to pursue our weary way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFollow me, my friends,\u201d said Burkhardt, as he, with quickened step,\r\npreceded them, that he might give some orders for their entertainment\r\nThe pilgrims rejoicing in so kind a reception, followed the knight in\r\nsilence into a high-vaulted saloon, over which the tapers that were\r\nplaced in branches against the walls cast a solemn but pleasing light,\r\nwell in accordance with the present feelings of the parties.\r\n\r\nThe knight then discerned two countenances, the pleasing impression of\r\nwhich was considerably heightened by the modest yet easy manner with\r\nwhich the youthful pair received their host\u2019s kind attentions. Much\r\nstruck with their appearance and demeanour, Burkhardt was involuntarily\r\nled back into the train of thoughts from which their approach had\r\naroused him; and the scenes of former days flitted before him as he\r\nrecollected that in this hall his beloved child was ever wont to greet\r\nhim with her welcome smile on his return from the battle or the chase;\r\nbrief scenes of happiness, which had been followed by events that had\r\ncankered his heart, and rendered memory but an instrument of bitterness\r\nand chastisement.\r\n\r\nSupper was soon after served, and the pilgrims were supplied with the\r\ngreatest attention, yet conversation wholly languished; for his\r\nmelancholy reflections occupied Burkhardt, and respect, or perhaps a\r\nmore kindly feeling, towards their host and benefactor, seemed to have\r\nsealed the lips of his youthful guests. After supper, however, a flask\r\nof the baron\u2019s old wine cheered his flagging spirits, and emboldened the\r\nelder pilgrim to break through the spell which had chained them.\r\n\r\n\u201cPardon me, noble sir,\u201d said he, \u201cfor I feel it must seem intrusive in\r\nme to seek the cause of that sorrow which renders you so sad a spectator\r\nof the bounty and happiness which you liberally bestow upon others.\r\nBelieve me, it is not the impulse of a mere idle curiosity that makes me\r\nexpress my wonder that you can thus dwell alone in this spacious and\r\nnoble mansion, the prey to a deeply-rooted sorrow. Would that it were in\r\nour power to alleviate the cares of one who with such bounteous hand\r\nrelieves the wants of his poorer brethren!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thank you for your sympathy, good pilgrim,\u201d said the old noble, \u201cbut\r\nwhat can it avail you to know the story of those griefs which have made\r\nthis earth a desert? and which are, with rapid pace, conducting me where\r\nalone I can expect to find rest. Spare me, then, the pain of recalling\r\nscenes which I would fain bury in oblivion. As yet, you are in the\r\nspring of life, when no sad remembrance gives a discordant echo of past\r\nfollies, or of joys irrecoverably lost. Seek not to darken the sunshine\r\nof your youth with a knowledge of those fierce, guilty beings who, in\r\nlistening to the fiend-like suggestions of their passions, are led\r\nastray from the paths of rectitude, and tear asunder the ties of\r\nnature.\u201d\r\n\r\nBurkhardt thus sought to avoid the entreaty of the pilgrim. But the\r\nrequest was still urged with such earnest though delicate persuasion,\r\nand the rich tones of the stranger\u2019s voice awoke within him so many\r\nthoughts of days long, long past, that the knight felt himself almost\r\nirresistibly impelled to unburden his long-closed heart to one who\r\nseemed to enter into its feelings with a sincere cordiality.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour artless sympathy has won my confidence, my young friends,\u201d said\r\nhe, \u201cand you shall learn the cause of my sorrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see me here, lonely and forsaken. But fortune once looked upon me\r\nwith her blandest smiles; and I felt myself rich in the consciousness of\r\nmy prosperity, and the gifts which bounteous Heaven had bestowed. My\r\npowerful vassals made me a terror to those enemies which the protection\r\nthat I was ever ready to afford to the oppressed and helpless brought\r\nagainst me. My broad and fertile possessions enabled me, with liberal\r\nhand, to relieve the wants of the poor, and to exercise the rights of\r\nhospitality in a manner becoming my state and my name. But of all the\r\ngifts which Heaven had showered upon me, that which I most prized was a\r\nwife, whose virtues had made her the idol of both the rich and the poor.\r\nBut she who was already an angel, and unfitted for this grosser world,\r\nwas too soon, alas! claimed by her kindred spirits. One brief year alone\r\nhad beheld our happiness.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy grief and anguish were most bitter, and would soon have laid me in\r\nthe same grave with her, but that she had left me a daughter, for whose\r\ndear sake I struggled earnestly against my affliction. In her were now\r\ncentred all my cares, all my hopes, all my happiness. As she grew in\r\nyears, so did her likeness to her sainted mother increase; and every\r\nlook and gesture reminded me of my Agnes. With her mother\u2019s beauty I\r\nhad, with fond presumption, dared to cherish the hope that Ida would\r\ninherit her mother\u2019s virtues.\r\n\r\n\u201cGreatly did I feel the void that my irreparable loss had made; but the\r\nvery thought of marrying again seemed to me a profanation. If, however,\r\neven for a single instant I had entertained this disposition, one look\r\nat our child would have crushed it, and made me cling with still fonder\r\nhope to her, in the fond confidence that she would reward me for every\r\nsacrifice that I could make. Alas! my friends, this hope was built on an\r\nunsure foundation! and my heart is even now tortured when I think on\r\nthose delusive dreams.\r\n\r\n\u201cIda, with the fondest caresses, would dispel each care from my brow; in\r\nsickness and in health she watched me with the tenderest solicitude; her\r\nwhole endeavour seemed to be to anticipate my wishes. But, alas! like\r\nthe serpent, which only fascinates to destroy, she lavished these\r\ncaresses and attentions to blind me, and wrap me in fatal security.\r\n\r\n\u201cMany and deep were the affronts, revenged indeed, but not forgotten,\r\nwhich had long since caused (with shame I avow it) a deadly hatred\r\nbetween myself and Rupert, Lord of W\u00e4dischwyl, which the slightest\r\noccasion seemed to increase to a degree of madness. As he dared no\r\nlonger throw down the gauntlet, he found means, much harder than steel\r\nor iron, to glut his revenge upon me.\r\n\r\n\u201cDuke Berchtold of Z\u00e4hringen, one of those wealthy and powerful tyrants\r\nwho are the very pests of that society of whose rights they ought to be\r\nthe ready guardians, had made a sudden irruption on the peaceful\r\ninhabitants of the mountains, seizing their herds and flocks, and\r\ninsulting their wives and daughters. Though possessed of great courage,\r\nyet being not much used to warfare, these unhappy men found it\r\nimpossible to resist the tyrant, and hastened to entreat my instant\r\nsuccour. Without a moment\u2019s delay, I assembled my brave vassals, and\r\nmarched against the spoiler. After a long and severe struggle, God\r\nblessed our cause, and our victory was complete.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the morning that I was to depart on my return to my castle, one of\r\nmy followers announced to me that the duke had arrived in my camp, and\r\nwished an immediate interview with me. I instantly went forth to meet\r\nhim; and Berchtold, hastening towards me with a smile, offered me his\r\nhand in token of reconciliation. I frankly accepted it, not suspecting\r\nthat falsehood could lurk beneath so open and friendly an aspect.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My friend,\u2019 said he, \u2018for such I must call you; your valour in this\r\ncontest has won my esteem, although I could at once convince you that I\r\nhave just cause of quarrel with the insolent mountaineers. But, in spite\r\nof your victory in this unjust strife, into which doubtless you were\r\ninduced to enter by the misrepresentations of those villains, yet as my\r\nnature abhors to prolong dissensions, I would willingly cease to think\r\nthat we are enemies, and commence a friendship which, on my part, at\r\nleast, shall not be broken. In token, therefore, that you do not\r\nmistrust a fellow-soldier, return with me to my castle, that we may\r\nthere drown all remembrance of our past dissensions.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cDuring a long time I resisted his importunity, for I had now been more\r\nthan a year absent from my home, and was doubly impatient to return, as\r\nI fondly imagined that my delay would occasion much anxiety to my\r\ndaughter. But the duke, with such apparent kindness and in such a\r\ncourteous manner, renewed and urged his solicitations, that I could\r\nresist no longer.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis Highness entertained me with the greatest hospitality and\r\nunremitted attention. But I soon perceived that an _honest_ man is more\r\nin his element amidst the toils of the battle than amongst the\r\nblandishments of a Court, where the lip and the gesture carry welcome,\r\nbut where the heart, to which the tongue is never the herald, is\r\ncorroded by the unceasing strifes of jealousy and envy. I soon, too, saw\r\nthat my rough and undisguised manners were an occasion of much mirth to\r\nthe perfumed and essenced nothings who crowded the halls of the duke. I\r\nhowever stifled my resentment, when I considered that these creatures\r\nlived but in his favour, like those swarms of insects which are warmed\r\ninto existence from the dunghill, by the sun\u2019s rays.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had remained the unwilling guest of the duke during some days, when\r\nthe arrival of a stranger of distinction was announced with much\r\nceremony; this stranger I found to be my bitterest foe, Rupert of\r\nW\u00e4dischwyl. The duke received him with the most marked politeness and\r\nattention, and more than once I fancied that I perceived the precedence\r\nof me was studiously given to my enemy. My frank yet haughty nature\r\ncould ill brook this disparagement; and, besides, it seemed to me that I\r\nshould but play the hypocrite if I partook of the same cup with the man\r\nfor whom I entertained a deadly hatred.\r\n\r\n\u201cI resolved therefore to depart, and sought his Highness to bid him\r\nfarewell. He appeared much distressed at my resolution, and earnestly\r\npressed me to avow the cause of my abrupt departure. I candidly\r\nconfessed that the undue favour which I thought he showed to my rival,\r\nwas the cause.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am hurt, deeply hurt,\u2019 said the duke, affecting an air of great\r\nsorrow, \u2018that my friend, and that friend the valiant Unspunnen, should\r\nthink thus unjustly, dare I add, thus meanly of me. No, I have not even\r\nin thought wronged you; and to prove my sincerity and my regard for your\r\nwelfare, know that it was not chance which conducted your adversary to\r\nmy court. He comes in consequence of my eager wish to reconcile two men\r\nwhom I so much esteem, and whose worth and excellence place them amongst\r\nthe brightest ornaments of our favoured land. Let me, therefore,\u2019 said\r\nhe, taking my hand and the hand of Rupert, who had entered during our\r\ndiscourse, \u2018let me have the satisfaction of reconciling two such men,\r\nand of terminating your ancient discord. You cannot refuse a request so\r\ncongenial to that holy faith which we all profess. Suffer me therefore\r\nto be the minister of peace, and to suggest that, in token and in\r\nconfirmation of an act which will draw down Heaven\u2019s blessing on us all,\r\nyou will permit our holy Church to unite in one your far-famed lovely\r\ndaughter with Lord Rupert\u2019s only son, whose virtues, if reports speak\r\ntruly, render him no undeserving object of her love.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cA rage, which seemed in an instant to turn my blood into fire, and\r\nwhich almost choked my utterance, took possession of me.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What!\u2019 exclaimed I, \u2018what, think you that I would thus sacrifice,\r\n_thus_ cast away my precious jewel! thus debase my beloved Ida? No, by\r\nher sainted mother, I swear that rather than see her married to _his_\r\nson, I would devote her to the cloister! Nay, I would rather see her\r\ndead at my feet than suffer her purity to be sullied by such\r\ncontamination!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018But for the presence of his Highness,\u2019 cried Rupert wrathfully, \u2018your\r\nlife should instantly answer for this insult! Nathless, I will well mark\r\nyou, and watch you, too, my lord; and if you escape my revenge, you are\r\nmore than man.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Indeed, indeed, my Lord of Unspunnen,\u2019 said the duke, \u2018you are much\r\ntoo rash. Your passion has clouded your reason; and, believe me, you\r\nwill live to repent having so scornfully refused my friendly proposal.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You may judge me rash, my Lord Duke, and perhaps think me somewhat too\r\nbold, because I dare assert the truth in the courts of princes. But\r\nsince my tongue cannot frame itself to speak that which my heart does\r\nnot dictate, and my plain but honest manner seems to displease you, I\r\nwill, with your Highness\u2019s permission, withdraw to my own domain, whence\r\nI have been but too long absent.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Undoubtedly, my lord, you have my permission,\u2019 said the duke\r\nhaughtily, and at the same time turning coldly from me.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy horse was brought, I mounted him with as much composure as I could\r\ncommand, and I breathed more freely as I left the castle far behind.\r\n\r\n\u201cDuring the second day\u2019s journey I arrived within a near view of my own\r\nnative mountains, and I felt doubly invigorated as their pure breezes\r\nwere wafted towards me. Still the fond anxiety of a father for his\r\nbeloved child, and that child his only treasure, made the way seem\r\ndoubly long. But as I approached the turn of the road which is\r\nimmediately in front of my castle, I almost then wished the way\r\nlengthened; for my joy, my hopes, and my apprehensions crowded upon me\r\nalmost to suffocation. \u2018A few short minutes, however,\u2019 I thought, \u2018and\r\nthen the truth, ill or good, will be known to me.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I came in full sight of my dwelling, all seemed in peace; nought\r\nexhibited any change since I had left it. I spurred my horse on to the\r\ngate, but as I advanced the utter stillness and desertion of all around\r\nsurprised me. Not a domestic, not a peasant, was to be seen in the\r\ncourts; it appeared as if the inhabitants of the castle were still\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Merciful Heaven!\u2019 I thought, \u2018what can this stillness forebode! Is\r\nshe, is my beloved child dead?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI could not summon courage to pull the bell. Thrice I attempted, yet\r\nthrice the dread of learning the awful truth prevented me. One moment,\r\none word, even one sign, and I might be a forlorn, childless, wretched\r\nman, for ever! None but a father can feel or fully sympathize in the\r\nagony of those moments! none but a father can ever fitly describe them!\r\n\r\n\u201cI was aroused from this inactive state by my faithful dog springing\r\ntowards me to welcome my return with his boisterous caresses, and deep\r\nand loud-toned expressions of his joy. Then the old porter, attracted by\r\nthe noise, came to the gate, which he instantly opened; but, as he was\r\nhurrying forward to meet me, I readily perceived that some sudden and\r\npainful recollection checked his eagerness. I leaped from my horse\r\nquickly, and entered the hall. All the other domestics now came forward,\r\nexcept my faithful steward Wilfred, he who had been always the foremost\r\nto greet his master.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where is my daughter? where is your mistress?\u2019 I eagerly exclaimed;\r\n\u2018let me but know that she lives!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe faithful Wilfred, who had now entered the hall, threw himself at my\r\nfeet, and with the tears rolling down his furrowed cheeks, earnestly\r\npressed my hand, and hesitatingly informed me that my daughter _lived_:\r\nwas well, he believed, but\u2014had quitted the castle.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Now, speak more quickly, old man,\u2019 said I hastily, and passionately\r\ninterrupting him. \u2018What is it you can mean? my daughter lives; my Ida is\r\nwell, but she is _not here_. Now, have you and my vassals proved\r\nrecreants, and suffered my castle in my absence to be robbed of its\r\ngreatest treasure? Speak! speak plainly, I command ye!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is with anguish, as great almost as your own can be, my beloved\r\nmaster, that I make known to you the sad truth that your daughter has\r\nquitted her father\u2019s roof to become the wife of Conrad, the son of the\r\nLord of W\u00e4dischwyl.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The wife of Lord Rupert\u2019s son! my Ida the wife of the son of him whose\r\nvery name my soul loathes!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cMy wrath now knew no bounds; the torments of hell seemed to have\r\nchanged the current of my blood. In the madness of my passion I even\r\ncursed my own dear daughter! Yes, pilgrim, I even cursed her on whom I\r\nso fondly doted; for whose sake alone life for me had any charms. Oh!\r\nhow often since have I attempted to recall that curse! and these bitter\r\ntears, which even now I cannot control, witness how severe has been my\r\nrepentance of that awful and unnatural act!\r\n\r\n\u201cDreadful were the imprecations which I heaped upon my enemy; and deep\r\nwas the revenge I swore. I know not to what fearful length my unbridled\r\npassion would have hurried me, had I not, from its very excess, sunk\r\nsenseless into the arms of my domestics. When I recovered, I found\r\nmyself in my own chamber, and Wilfred seated near me. Some time,\r\nhowever, elapsed before I came to a clear recollection of the past\r\nevents; and when I did, it seemed as if an age of crime and misery had\r\nweighed me down, and chained my tongue. My eye involuntarily wandered to\r\nthat part of the chamber where hung my daughter\u2019s portrait. But this the\r\nfaithful old man\u2014who had not removed it, no doubt thinking that to do so\r\nwould have offended me\u2014had contrived to hide, by placing before it a\r\npiece of armour, which seemed as though it had accidentally fallen into\r\nthat position.\r\n\r\n\u201cMany more days elapsed ere I was enabled to listen to the particulars\r\nof my daughter\u2019s flight, which I will, not to detain you longer with my\r\ngriefs, now briefly relate.\u2014It appeared that, urged by the fame of her\r\nbeauty, and by a curiosity most natural, I confess to youth, Conrad of\r\nW\u00e4dischwyl had, for a long time sought, but sought in vain, to see my\r\nIda. Chance at length, however, favoured him. On her way to hear mass at\r\nour neighbouring monastery, he beheld her; and beheld her but to love.\r\nHer holy errand did not prevent him from addressing her; and well he\r\nknew how to gain the ear of one so innocent, so unsuspicious as my Ida!\r\nToo soon, alas! did his flatteries win their way to her guiltless heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy child\u2019s affection for her father was unbounded; and readily would\r\nshe have sacrificed her life for mine. But when love has once taken\r\npossession of the female heart, too quickly drives he thence those\r\nsterner guests, reason and duty. Suffice it therefore to say she was\r\nwon, and induced to unite herself to W\u00e4dischwyl, before my return, by\r\nhis crafty and insidious argument that I should be more easily persuaded\r\nto give them my pardon and my blessing, when I found that the step that\r\nshe had taken was irrevocable. With almost equal art, he pleaded too\r\nthat their union would doubtless heal the breach between the families of\r\nW\u00e4dischwyl and Unspunnen; and thus terminate that deadly hatred which my\r\ngentle Ida, ever the intercessor for peace, had always condemned. By\r\nthis specious of sophistry my poor child was prevailed upon to tear\r\nherself from the heart of a fond parent, to unite herself with the son\r\nof that parent\u2019s most bitter enemy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe pain of these recollections so overcame Burkhardt, that some time\r\nelapsed ere he could master his feelings. At length he proceeded.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy soul seemed now to have but one feeling, _revenge_. All other\r\npassions were annihilated by this master one; and I instantly prepared\r\nmyself and my vassals to chastise this worse than robber. But such\r\nsatisfaction was (I now thank God) denied me; for the Duke of Z\u00e4hringen\r\nsoon gave me memorable cause to recollect his parting words. Having\r\nattached himself with his numerous followers to my rival\u2019s party, these\r\npowerful chiefs suddenly invaded my domain. A severe struggle against\r\nmost unequal numbers ensued. But, at length, though my brave retainers\r\nwould fain have prolonged the hopeless strife, resolved to stop a\r\nneedless waste of blood, I left the field to my foes; and, with the\r\nremnant of my faithful soldiers, hastened, in deep mortification, to\r\nbury myself within these walls. This galling repulse prevented all\r\npossibility of reconciliation with my daughter, whom I now regarded as\r\nthe cause of my disgrace; and, consequently, I forbade her name even to\r\nbe mentioned in my presence.\r\n\r\n\u201cYears rolled on; and I had no intelligence of her until I learned by a\r\nmere chance that she had with her husband quitted her native land.\r\nAltogether, more than twenty, to me long, long years, have now passed\r\nsince her flight; and though, when time brought repentance, and my anger\r\nand revenge yielded to better feelings, I made every effort to gain\r\ntidings of my poor child, I have not yet been able to discover any\r\nfurther traces of her. Here therefore have I lived a widowed, childless,\r\nheart-broken old man. But I have at least learned to bow to the\r\ndispensations of an all-wise Providence, which has in its justice\r\nstricken me, for thus remorselessly cherishing that baneful passion\r\nwhich Holy Law so expressly forbids. Oh! how I have yearned to see my\r\nbeloved child! how I have longed to clasp her to this withered, blighted\r\nheart! With scalding tears of the bitterest repentance have I revoked\r\nthose deadly curses, which, in the plenitude of my unnatural wrath, I\r\ndared to utter daily. Ceaselessly do I now weary Heaven with my prayers\r\nto obliterate all memory of those fatal imprecations; or to let them\r\nfall on my own head, and shower down only its choicest blessings on that\r\nof my beloved child! But a fear, which freezes my veins with horror,\r\nconstantly haunts me lest the maledictions which I dared to utter in my\r\nmoments of demoniac vindictiveness, should, in punishment for my\r\nimpiety, have been fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\u201cOften, in my dreams, do I behold my beloved child; but her looks are\r\nalways in sadness, and she ever seems mildly but most sorrowfully to\r\nupbraid me for having so inhumanly cast her from me. Yet she must, I\r\nfear, have died long ere now; for, were she living, she would not, I\r\nthink, have ceased to endeavour to regain the affections of a father who\r\nonce loved her so tenderly. It is true that at first she made many\r\nefforts to obtain my forgiveness. Nay, I have subsequently learned that\r\nshe even knelt at the threshold of my door, and piteously supplicated to\r\nbe allowed to see me. But my commands had been so peremptory, and the\r\nsteward who had replaced Wilfred, after his death, was of so stern and\r\nunbending a disposition, that, just and righteous as was this her last\r\nrequest, it was unfeelingly denied to her. Eternal Heaven! she whom I\r\nhad loved as perhaps never father loved before\u2014she whom I had fondly\r\nwatched almost hourly lest the rude breeze of winter should chill her,\r\nor the summer\u2019s heat should scorch her\u2014she whom I had cherished in\r\nsickness through many a livelong night, with a mother\u2019s devotion, and\r\nmore than a mother\u2019s solicitude, even _she_, the only child of my\r\nbeloved Agnes, and the anxious object of the last moments of her life,\r\nwas spurned from my door! from this door whence no want goes unrelieved,\r\nand where the very beggar finds rest! And now, when I would bless the\r\nlips that even could say to me \u2018she lives,\u2019 I can nowhere gather the\r\nslightest tidings of my child. Ah, had I listened to the voice of\r\nreason, had I not suffered my better feelings to be mastered by the\r\nwildest and fellest passions, I might have seen herself, and perhaps her\r\nchildren, happy around me, cheering the evening of my life. And when my\r\nlast hour shall come, they would have closed my eyes in peace, and, in\r\nunfeigned sorrow have daily addressed to Heaven their innocent prayers\r\nfor my soul\u2019s eternal rest.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou now know, pilgrims, the cause of my grief; and I see by the tears\r\nwhich you have so abundantly shed, that you truly pity the forlorn being\r\nbefore you. Remember him and his sorrows therefore ever in your prayers;\r\nand when you kneel at the shrine to which you are bound, let not those\r\nsorrows be forgotten.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe elder pilgrim in vain attempted to answer; the excess of his\r\nfeelings overpowered his utterance. At length, throwing himself at the\r\nfeet of Burkhardt, and casting off his pilgrim\u2019s habits, he with\r\ndifficulty exclaimed,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here, thine Ida\u2019s son! and behold in my youthful companion, thine\r\nIda\u2019s daughter! Yes, before you kneel the children of her whom you so\r\nmuch lament. We came to sue for that pardon, for that love, which we had\r\nfeared would have been denied us. But, thanks be to God, who has\r\nmollified your heart, we have only to implore that you will suffer us to\r\nuse our poor efforts to alleviate your sorrows, and render more bright\r\nand cheerful your declining years.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn wild and agitated surprise, Burkhardt gazed intently upon them. It\r\nseemed to him as if a beautiful vision were before him, which he feared\r\neven a breath might dispel. When, however, he became assured that he was\r\nunder the influence of no delusion, the tumult of his feelings\r\noverpowered him, and he sank senselessly on the neck of the elder\r\npilgrim; who, with his sister\u2019s assistance, quickly raised the old man,\r\nand by their united efforts restored him, ere long, to his senses. But\r\nwhen Burkhardt beheld the younger pilgrim, the very image of his lost\r\nIda, bending over him with the most anxious and tender solicitude, he\r\nthought that death had ended all his worldly sufferings, and that heaven\r\nhad already opened to his view.\r\n\r\n\u201cGreat God!\u201d at length he exclaimed, \u201cI am unworthy of these Thy\r\nmercies! Grant me to receive them as I ought! I need not ask,\u201d added he\r\nafter a pause, and pressing the pilgrims to his bosom, \u201cfor a\r\nconfirmation of your statement, or of my own sensations of joy. All, all\r\ntells me that you are the children of my beloved Ida. Say, therefore, is\r\nyour mother dead? or dare I hope once more to clasp her to my heart?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe elder pilgrim, whose name was Hermann, then stated to him that two\r\nyears had passed since his parent had breathed her last in his arms. Her\r\nlatest prayer was, that Heaven would forgive her the sorrow she had\r\ncaused her father, and forbear to visit her own error on her children\u2019s\r\nheads. He then added that his father had been dead many years.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy mother,\u201d continued Hermann, drawing from his bosom a small sealed\r\npacket, \u201ccommanded me, on her deathbed, to deliver this into your own\r\nhands. \u2018My son,\u2019 she said, \u2018when I am dead, if my father still lives,\r\ncast yourself at his feet, and desist not your supplications until you\r\nhave obtained from him a promise that he will read this prayer. It will\r\nacquaint him with a repentance that may incite him to recall his curse;\r\nand thus cause the earth to lie lightly on all that will shortly remain\r\nof his once loved Ida. Paint to him the hours of anguish which even your\r\ntender years have witnessed. Weary him, my son, with your entreaties;\r\ncease them not until you have wrung from him his forgiveness.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you may suppose, I solemnly engaged to perform my mother\u2019s request;\r\nand as soon as our grief for the loss of so dear, so fond a parent,\r\nwould permit us, my sister and myself resolved, in these pilgrim\u2019s\r\nhabits, to visit your castle; and, by gradual means, attempt to win your\r\naffections, if we found you still relentless, and unwilling to listen to\r\nour mother\u2019s prayer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPraise be to God, my son,\u201d said Burkhardt, \u201cat whose command the waters\r\nspring from the barren rock, that He has bidden the streams of love and\r\nrepentance to flow once more from my once barren and flinty heart. But\r\nlet me not delay to open this sad memorial of your mother\u2019s griefs. I\r\nwish you, my children, to listen to it, that you may hear both her\r\nexculpation and her wrongs.\u201d\r\n\r\nBurkhardt hid his face in his hands, and remained for some moments\r\nearnestly struggling with his feelings. At length he broke the seal,\r\nand, with a voice which at times was almost overpowered, read aloud the\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\u201cMy beloved father,\u2014if by that fond title your daughter may still\r\naddress you,\u2014feeling that my sad days are now numbered, I make this last\r\neffort, ere my strength shall fail me, to obtain at least your pity for\r\nher you once so much loved; and to beseech you to recall that curse\r\nwhich has weighed too heavily upon her heart. Indeed, my father, I am\r\nnot quite that guilty wretch you think me. Do not imagine that,\r\nneglecting every tie of duty and gratitude, I could have left the\r\ntenderest of parents to his widowed lonely home, and have united myself\r\nwith the son of his sworn foe, had I not fondly, most ardently, hoped,\r\nnay, had cherished the idea almost to certainty, that you would, when\r\nyou found that I was a wife, have quickly pardoned a fault, which the\r\nfears of your refusal to our union had alone tempted me to commit. I\r\nfirmly believed that my husband would then have shared with me my\r\nfather\u2019s love, and have, with his child, the pleasing task of watching\r\nover his happiness and comfort. But never did I for an instant imagine\r\nthat I was permanently wounding the heart of that father. My youth, and\r\nthe ardour of my husband\u2019s persuasions, must plead some extenuation of\r\nmy fault.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe day that I learnt the news of your having pronounced against me\r\nthat fatal curse, and your fixed determination never more to admit me to\r\nyour presence, has been marked in characters indelible on my memory. At\r\nthat moment it appeared as if Heaven had abandoned me, had marked me for\r\nits reprobation as a parricide! My brain and my heart seemed on fire,\r\nwhilst my blood froze in my veins. The chillness of death crept over\r\nevery limb, and my tongue refused all utterance. I would have wept, but\r\nthe source of my tears was dried within me.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long I remained in this state I know not, as I became insensible,\r\nand remained so for some days. On returning to a full consciousness of\r\nmy wretchedness, I would instantly have rushed to you, and cast myself\r\nat your feet, to wring from you, if possible, your forgiveness; but my\r\nlimbs were incapable of all motion. Soon, too, I learned that the\r\nletters which I dictated were returned unopened; and my husband at last\r\ninformed me that all his efforts to see you had been utterly fruitless.\r\n\r\n\u201cYet the moment I had gained sufficient strength, I went to the castle,\r\nbut, unfortunately for me, even as I entered, I encountered a stern\r\nwretch, to whom my person was not unknown; and he instantly told me that\r\nmy efforts to see his master would be useless. I used prayers and\r\nentreaties; I even knelt upon the bare ground to him. But so far from\r\nlistening to me, he led me to the gate, and, in my presence, dismissed\r\nthe old porter who had admitted me, and who afterwards followed my\r\nfortunes until the hour of his death. Finding that all my attempts were\r\nfruitless, and that several of the old servants had been discarded on my\r\naccount, with a heart completely broken, I succumbed to my fate, and\r\nabandoned all further attempt.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter the birth of my son (to whose fidelity and love I trust this sad\r\nmemorial), my husband, with the tenderest solicitude, employed every\r\nmeans in his power to divert my melancholy, and having had a valuable\r\nproperty in Italy bequeathed to him, prevailed upon me to repair to that\r\nfavoured and beauteous country. But neither the fond attentions of my\r\nbeloved Conrad, nor the bright sunshine and luxurious breezes, could\r\novercome a grief so deeply rooted as mine; and I soon found that Italy\r\nhad less charms for me than my own dear native land, with its dark\r\npine-clad mountains.\r\n\r\n\u201cShortly after we had arrived at Rome, I gave birth to a daughter;\u2014an\r\nevent which was only too soon followed by the death of my affectionate\r\nhusband. The necessity of ceaseless attention to my infant in some\r\nmeasure alleviated the intense anguish which I suffered from that most\r\nsevere loss. Nevertheless, in the very depth of this sorrow, which\r\nalmost overcharged my heart, Heaven only knows how often, and how\r\nremorsefully, while bending over my own dear children in sickness, have\r\nI called to mind the anxious fondness with which the tenderest and best\r\nof fathers used to watch over me!\r\n\r\n\u201cI struggled long and painfully with my feelings, and often did I\r\nbeseech God to spare my life, that I might be enabled to instruct my\r\nchildren in His holy love and fear, and teach them to atone for the\r\nerror of their parent. My prayer has in mercy been heard; the boon I\r\nsupplicated has been granted; and I trust, my beloved father, that if\r\nthese children should be admitted to your affections, you will find that\r\nI have trained up two blessed intercessors for your forgiveness, when it\r\nshall have pleased Heaven to have called your daughter to her account\r\nbefore that dread tribunal where a sire\u2019s curse will plead so awfully\r\nagainst her. Recall then, oh, father! recall your dreadful malediction\r\nfrom your poor repentant Ida! and send your blessing as an angel of\r\nmercy to plead for her eternal rest. Farewell, my father, for ever! for\r\never, farewell! By the cross, whose emblem her fevered lips now press;\r\nby Him, who in His boundless mercy hung upon that cross, your daughter,\r\nyour once much loved Ida, implores you, supplicates you, not to let her\r\nplead in vain!\u201d\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\u201cMy child, my child!\u201d sobbed Burkhardt, as the letter dropped from his\r\nhand, \u201cmay the Father of All forgive me as freely as I from the depths\r\nof my wrung heart forgive you! Would that your remorseful father could\r\nhave pressed you to his heart, with his own lips have assured you of his\r\naffection, and wiped away the tears of sorrow from your eyes! But he\r\nwill cherish these beloved remembrances of you, and will more jealously\r\nguard them than his own life.\u201d\r\n\r\nBurkhardt passed the whole of the following day in his chamber, to which\r\nthe good Father Jerome alone was admitted, as the events of the\r\npreceding day rendered a long repose absolutely necessary. The following\r\nmorning, however, he entered the hall, where Hermann and Ida were\r\nimpatiently waiting for him. His pale countenance still exhibited deep\r\ntraces of the agitation he had experienced; but having kissed his\r\nchildren most affectionately, he smilingly flung round Ida\u2019s neck a\r\nmassive gold chain, richly wrought, with a bunch of keys appended to it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must duly install our Lady of the Castle,\u201d said he, \u201cand invest her\r\nwith her appropriate authorities.\u2014But, hark! from the sound of the\r\nporter\u2019s horn it seems as if our hostess would have early calls upon her\r\nhospitality. Whom have we here?\u201d continued he, looking out up the\r\navenue. \u201cBy St. Hubert, a gay and gallant knight is approaching, who\r\nshall be right welcome\u2014that is, if my lady approve. Well, Willibald,\r\nwhat bring you?\u2014a letter from our good friend the Abbot of St. Anselm.\r\nWhat says he?\u201d\r\n\r\n    \u201cI am sure that you will not refuse your welcome to a young knight,\r\n    who is returning by your castle to his home, from the Emperor\u2019s\r\n    wars. He is well known to me, and I can vouch for his being a guest\r\n    worthy of your hospitality, which will not be the less freely\r\n    granted to him because he does not bask in the _golden_ smiles of\r\n    fortune.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, that it shall not, my good friend; and if fortune frown upon\r\nhim, he shall be doubly welcome. Conduct him hither instantly, good\r\nWillibald.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe steward hastened to usher in the stranger, who advanced into the\r\nhall with a modest but manly air. He was apparently about twenty-five\r\nyears of age; his person was such as might well, in the dreams of a\r\nyoung maiden, occupy no unconspicuous place.\r\n\r\n\u201cSir Knight,\u201d said Burkhardt, taking him cordially by the hand, \u201cyou are\r\nright welcome to my castle, and such poor entertainment as it can\r\nafford. We must make you forget your wounds, and the rough usage of a\r\nsoldier\u2019s life. But, soft, I already neglect my duty in not first\r\nintroducing our hostess,\u201d added the aged knight, presenting Ida. \u201cBy my\r\nfaith,\u201d he continued, \u201cjudging from my lady\u2019s blushing smile, you seem\r\nnot to have met for the first time. Am I right in my conjecture?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe _have_ met, sir,\u201d replied Ida, with such confusion as pleasantly\r\nimplied that the meeting was not indifferently recollected, \u201cin the\r\nparlour of the abbess of the Ursulines, at Munich, where I have\r\nsometimes been to visit a much valued friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe abbess,\u201d said the young knight, \u201cwas my cousin; and my good fortune\r\nmore than once gave me the happiness of seeing in her convent this lady.\r\nBut little did I expect that amongst these mountains the fickle goddess\r\nwould again have so favoured a homeless wanderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Sir Knight,\u201d replied Burkhardt, \u201cwe trust that fortune has been\r\nequally favourable to us. And now we will make bold to ask your name;\r\nand then, without useless and tedious ceremony, on the part of ourselves\r\nand our hostess, bid you again a hearty welcome.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name,\u201d said the stranger, \u201cis Walter de Blumfeldt; though humble, it\r\nhas never been disgraced; and with the blessing of Heaven, I hope to\r\nhand it down as honoured as I have received it.\u201d\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWeeks, months rolled on, and Walter de Blumfeldt was still the guest of\r\nthe Lord of Unspunnen; till, by his virtues, and the many excellent\r\nqualities which daily more and more developed themselves, he wound\r\nhimself around Burkhardt\u2019s heart, which the chastened life of the old\r\nknight had rendered particularly susceptible of the kindlier feelings.\r\nFrequently would he now, with tears in his eyes, declare that he wished\r\nhe could convince each and all with whom his former habits had caused\r\nany difference, how truly he forgave them, and desired their\r\nforgiveness.\r\n\r\n\u201cWould,\u201d said he one day, in allusion to this subject, \u201cthat I could\r\nhave met my old enemy, the Duke of Z\u00e4hringen, and with a truly heartfelt\r\npleasure and joy have embraced him, and numbered him amongst my friends.\r\nBut he is gathered to his fathers, and I know not whether he has left\r\nany one to bear his honours.\u201d\r\n\r\nEach time that Walter had offered to depart, Burkhardt had found some\r\nexcuse to detain him; for it seemed to him that in separating from his\r\nyoung guest he should lose a link of that chain which good fortune had\r\nso lately woven for him. Hermann, too, loved Walter as a brother; and\r\nIda fain would have imagined that she loved him as a sister; but her\r\nheart more plainly told her what her colder reasoning sought to hide.\r\nUnspunnen, who had for some time perceived the growing attachment\r\nbetween Walter and Ida, was not displeased at the discovery, as he had\r\nlong ceased to covet riches; and had learnt to prize the sterling worth\r\nof the young knight, who fully answered the high terms in which the\r\nPrior of St. Anselm always spoke of him. Walking one evening under the\r\nshade of that very avenue where he had first encountered Hermann and\r\nIda, he perceived the latter, at some little distance, in conversation\r\nwith Walter. It was evident to Burkhardt that the young knight was not\r\naddressing himself to a very unwilling ear, as Ida was totally\r\nregardless of the loud cough with which Burkhardt chose to be seized at\r\nthat moment; nor did she perceive him, until he exclaimed, or rather\r\nvociferated,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know, Walter, that, under this very avenue, two pilgrims, bound\r\nto some holy shrine, once accosted me; but that, in pity to my sins and\r\nforlorn condition, they exchanged their penitential journey for an act\r\nof greater charity, and have ever since remained to extend their kind\r\ncares to an aged and helpless relative. One, however, of these\r\naffectionate beings is now about to quit my abode, and to pass through\r\nthe rest of this life\u2019s pilgrimage with a helpmate, in the person of the\r\nfair daughter of the Baron de Leichtfeldt, and thus leave his poor\r\ncompanion with only the tedious society of an old man. Say, Sir Knight,\r\nwill thy valour suffer that such wrong be done; or wilt _thou_ undertake\r\nto conduct this forsaken pilgrim on her way, and guide her through the\r\nchequered paths of this variable life? I see by the lowliness with which\r\nyou bend, and the colour which mantles in your cheek, that I speak not\r\nto one insensible to an old man\u2019s appeal. But soft, soft, Sir Knight, my\r\nIda is not yet canonized, and therefore cannot afford to lose a hand,\r\nwhich inevitably must occur if you continue to press it with such very\r\nardent devotion. But what says our pilgrim; does she accept of thy\r\nconduct and service, Sir Knight?\u201d\r\n\r\nIda, scarcely able to support herself, threw herself on Burkhardt\u2019s\r\nneck. We will not raise the veil which covers the awful moment that\r\nrenders a man, as he supposes, happy or miserable for ever. Suffice it\r\nto say that the day which made Hermann the husband of the daughter of\r\nthe Baron de Leichtfeldt, saw Ida the wife of Walter de Blumfeldt.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSix months had passed rapidly away to the happy inhabitants of\r\nUnspunnen, and Burkhardt seemed almost to have grown young again. He was\r\none of the most active in the preparations which were necessary in\r\nconsequence of Walter suggesting that they should spend Ida\u2019s birthday\r\nin a favourite retreat of his and hers. This chosen spot was a beautiful\r\nmeadow, in front of which meandered a small limpid stream; at the back\r\nwas a gorgeous amphitheatre of trees, the wide-spreading branches of\r\nwhich cast a refreshing shade over the richly enamelled grass.\r\n\r\nIn this beauteous retreat were Burkhardt, Walter, and his Ida passing\r\nthe sultry hours of noon, when Walter, who had been relating some of his\r\nadventures at the court of the Emperor, and recounting the magnificence\r\nof the tournaments, turning to his bride, said,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what avails all that pomp, my Ida. How happy are we in this\r\npeaceful vale! we envy neither princes nor dukes their palaces or their\r\nstates. What say you, my Ida, could you brook the ceremony of a court,\r\nand the pride of royalty? Methinks even the coronet of a duchess would\r\nbut ill replace the wreath of blushing roses on your head.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGently, my good husband,\u201d replied Ida, laughing; \u201cthey say, you know,\r\nthat a woman loves these vanities too dearly in her heart ever to\r\ndespise them. Then how can you expect so frail a mortal as your poor\r\nwife to hold them in contempt? Indeed, I think,\u201d added she, assuming an\r\nair of burlesque dignity, \u201cthat I should make a lofty duchess, and wear\r\nmy coronet with most becoming grace. And now, by my faith, Walter, I\r\nrecollect that you have this day, like a true and gallant knight,\r\npromised to grant whatever boon I shall ask. On my bended knee,\r\ntherefore, I humbly sue that if you know any spell or magic wile, to\r\nmake a princess or a duchess for only a single day, that you will\r\nforthwith exercise your art upon me; just in order to enable me to\r\nascertain with how much or how little dignity I could sustain such\r\nhonours. It is no very difficult matter, Sir Knight: you have only to\r\ncall in the aid of Number Nip, or some such handy workman of the woods.\r\nAnswer, most chivalrous husband, for thy disconsolate wife rises not\r\nuntil her prayer is granted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Ida, you have indeed craved a rare boon,\u201d replied Walter; \u201cand how\r\nto grant it may well puzzle my brain till it becomes crazed with the\r\neffort. But, let me see, let me see,\u201d continued he musingly; \u201cI have\r\nit!\u2014Come hither, love, here is your throne,\u201d said he, placing her on a\r\ngentle eminence richly covered with the fragrant wild thyme and the\r\ndelicate harebell; \u201ckings might now envy you the incense which is\r\noffered to you. And you, noble sir,\u201d added he, addressing Burkhardt,\r\n\u201cmust stand beside her Highness, in quality of chief counsellor. There\r\nare your attendants around you; behold that tall oak, he must be your\r\nHighness\u2019s pursuivant; and yonder slender mountain ashes, your trusty\r\npages.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is but a poor fulfilment of the task you have undertaken, Sir\r\nmummer,\u201d said Ida, with a playful and arch affectation of\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave patience for a brief while, fair dame,\u201d replied Walter, laughing;\r\n\u201cfor now I must awaken your Highness\u2019s men-at-arms.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen, taking from his side a silver horn, he loudly sounded the\r\nmelodious reveille. As he withdrew the instrument from his lips, a\r\ntrumpet thrillingly answered to the call; and scarcely had its last\r\nnotes died away, when, from the midst of the woods, as if the very trees\r\nwere gifted with life, came forth a troop of horsemen, followed by a\r\nbody of archers on foot. They had but just entirely emerged, when\r\nnumerous peasants, both male and female, appeared in their gayest\r\nattire; and, together with the horsemen and the archers, rapidly and\r\npicturesquely ranged themselves in front of the astonished Ida, who had\r\nalready abdicated her throne, and clung to the arm of Walter. They then\r\nsuddenly divided, and twelve pages in richly-emblazoned dresses\r\nadvanced. After them followed six young girls, whose forms and features\r\nthe Graces might have envied, bearing two coronets placed on embroidered\r\ncushions. In the rear of these, supporting his steps with his abbatial\r\nstaff, walked the venerable Abbot of St. Anselm, who, with his white\r\nbeard flowing almost to his girdle, and his benign looks that showed the\r\npure commerce of the soul which gave life to an eye the brightness of\r\nwhich seventy years had scarcely diminished, seemed to Ida a being of\r\nanother world. The young girls then advancing, and kneeling before\r\nWalter and his wife, presented the coronets.\r\n\r\nIda, who had remained almost breathless with wonder, could now scarcely\r\narticulate,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDear, dear Walter, what is all this pomp\u2014what does\u2014what _can_ it mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMean! my beloved,\u201d replied her husband; \u201cdid you not bid me make you a\r\nduchess? I have but obeyed your high commands, and I now salute you,\r\n_Duchess_ of Z\u00e4hringen!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe whole multitude then made the woods resound with the acclamation,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201c_Long live the Duke and Duchess of Z\u00e4hringen!_\u201d\r\n\r\nWalter, having for some moments enjoyed the unutterable amazement of the\r\nnow breathless Ida, and the less evident but perhaps equally intense\r\nsurprise of Burkhardt, turning to the latter, said,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMy more than father, you see in me the son of your once implacable\r\nenemy, the Duke of Z\u00e4hringen. He has been many years gathered to his\r\nfathers; and I, as his only son, have succeeded to his title and his\r\npossessions. My heart, my liberty, were entirely lost in the parlour of\r\nthe Abbess of the Ursulines. But when I learnt whose child my Ida was,\r\nand your sad story, I resolved ere I would make her mine to win not only\r\nher love, but also your favour and esteem. How well I have succeeded,\r\nthis little magic circle on my Ida\u2019s finger is my witness. It will add\r\nno small measure to your happiness to know that my father had for many\r\nyears repented of the wrongs which he had done you; and, as much as\r\npossible to atone for them, entrusted the education of his son to the\r\ncare of this my best of friends, the Abbot of St. Anselm, that he might\r\nlearn to shun the errors into which his sire had unhappily fallen. And\r\nnow,\u201d continued he, advancing, and leading Ida towards the abbot, \u201cI\r\nhave only to beg your blessing, and that this lady, whom through\r\nHeaven\u2019s goodness I glory to call my wife, be invested with those\r\ninsignia of the rank which she is so fit to adorn.\u201d\r\n\r\nWalter, or, as we must now call him, the Duke of Z\u00e4hringen, with Ida,\r\nthen lowly knelt before the venerable abbot, whilst the holy man, with\r\ntears in his eyes, invoked upon them the blessings of Heaven. His\r\nHighness then rising, took one of the coronets, and placing it on Ida\u2019s\r\nhead, said,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMayst thou be as happy under this glittering coronet, as thou wert\r\nunder the russet hood in which I first beheld thee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGod and our Lady aid me!\u201d replied the agitated Ida; \u201cand may He grant\r\nthat I may wear it with as much humility. Yet thorns, they say, spring\r\nup beneath a crown.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue, my beloved,\u201d said the duke, \u201cand they also grow beneath the\r\npeasant\u2019s homely cap. But the rich alchemy of my Ida\u2019s virtues will ever\r\nconvert all thorns into the brightest jewels of her diadem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 FINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                MORRISON AND GIBB, PRINTERS, EDINBURGH.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PATERSON\u2019S\r\n                          NEW ENGLAND NOVELS.\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n      Cloth, gilt top, 2s. each; ornamental paper cover, 1s. each.\r\n\r\n                     Contain the following Works:\u2014\r\n\r\n                          NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE.\r\n\r\n         1.

The reader may\r\nfind a detail of his real adventures in Sismondi's delightful\r\npublication, _Histoire des Republiques Italiennes de l'Age Moyen_. In\r\naddition to this work, I have consulted Tegrino's Life of Castruccio,\r\nand Giovanni Villani's Florentine Annals.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is a translation from the article respecting\r\nhim in Moreri.\r\n\r\n\"Castruccio Castracani, one of the most celebrated captains of his time,\r\nlived in the fourteenth century. He was of the family of the\r\nAntelminelli of Lucca; and, having at a very early age borne arms in\r\nfavour of the Ghibelines, he was exiled by the Guelphs. He served not\r\nlong after in the armies of Philip king of France, who made war on the\r\nFlemings. In the sequel he repassed the Alps; and, having joined\r\nUguccione Faggiuola, chief of the Ghibelines of Tuscany, he reduced\r\nLucca, Pistoia, and several other towns. He became the ally of the\r\nemperor Louis of Bavaria, against pope John XXII, Robert king of Naples,\r\nand the Florentines. Louis of Bavaria gave him the investiture of Lucca\r\nunder the denomination of Duke, together with the title of Senator of\r\nRome. Nothing seemed able to oppose his courage and good fortune, when\r\nhe was taken off by a premature death in 1330, in the forty-seventh year\r\nof his age.\"\r\n\r\nThe dates here given are somewhat different from those adopted in the\r\nfollowing narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVALPERGA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\n_Birth of Castruccio.--His family exiled from\r\nLucca when he is eleven years of age._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other nations of Europe were yet immersed in barbarism, when Italy,\r\nwhere the light of civilization had never been wholly eclipsed, began to\r\nemerge from the darkness of the ruin of the Western Empire, and to catch\r\nfrom the East the returning rays of literature and science. At the\r\nbeginning of the fourteenth century Dante had already given a permanent\r\nform to the language which was the offspring of this revolution; he was\r\npersonally engaged in those political struggles, in which the elements\r\nof the good and evil that have since assumed a more permanent form were\r\ncontending; his disappointment and exile gave him leisure to meditate,\r\nand produced his _Divina Comedia_.\r\n\r\nLombardy and Tuscany, the most civilized districts of Italy, exhibited\r\nastonishing specimens of human genius; but at the same time they were\r\ntorn to pieces by domestic faction, and almost destroyed by the fury of\r\ncivil wars. The antient quarrels of the Guelphs and the Ghibelines were\r\nstarted with renovated zeal, under the new distinctions of _Bianchi_ and\r\n_Neri_[1]. The Ghibelines and the _Bianchi_ were the friends of the\r\nemperor, asserting the supremacy and universality of his sway over all\r\nother dominion, ecclesiastical or civil: the Guelphs and the _Neri_ were\r\nthe partizans of liberty. Florence was at the head of the Guelphs, and\r\nemployed, as they were employed by it in their turn, the Papal power as\r\na pretext and an instrument.\r\n\r\nThe distinctions of _Bianchi_ and _Neri_ took their rise in Pistoia, a\r\ntown of some moment between Florence and Lucca. The _Neri_ being\r\nexpelled from Pistoia, the exiles fixed their residence in Lucca; where\r\nthey so fortified and augmented their party, as to be able in the year\r\n1301 to expel the _Bianchi_, among whom was Castruccio Castracani dei\r\nAntelminelli.\r\n\r\nThe family of the Antelminelli was one of the most distinguished in\r\nLucca. They had followed the emperors in their Italian wars, and had\r\nreceived in recompense titles and reward. The father of Castruccio was\r\nthe chief of his house; he had been a follower of the unfortunate\r\nManfred, king of Naples, and his party feelings as a Ghibeline derived\r\nnew fervour from the adoration with which he regarded his noble master.\r\nManfred was the natural son of the last emperor of the house of Swabia;\r\nbefore the age of twenty he had performed the most brilliant exploits,\r\nand undergone the most romantic vicissitudes, in all of which the father\r\nof Castruccio had been his faithful page and companion. The unrelenting\r\nanimosity with which the successive Popes pursued his royal master, gave\r\nrise in his bosom to a hatred, that was heightened by the contempt with\r\nwhich he regarded their cowardly and artful policy.\r\n\r\nWhen therefore the quarrels of the Guelphs and Ghibelines were revived\r\nin Lucca under the names of _Bianchi_ and _Neri_, Ruggieri dei\r\nAntelminelli was the chief opponent and principal victim of the\r\nmachinations of the Papal party. Castruccio was then only eleven years\r\nof age; but his young imagination was deeply impressed by the scenes\r\nthat passed around him. When the citizens of Lucca had assembled on the\r\nappointed day to choose their _Podest\u00e0_, or principal magistrate, the\r\ntwo parties dividing on the Piazza glared defiance at each other: the\r\nGuelphs had the majority in numbers; but the Ghibelines wishing, like\r\nBrennus, to throw the sword into the ascending scale, assailed the\r\nstronger party with arms in their hands. They were repulsed; and, flying\r\nbefore their enemies, the Guelphs remained in possession of the field,\r\nwhere, under the guidance of their chiefs, they voted the perpetual\r\nbanishment of the Ghibelines; and the summons was read by a herald,\r\nwhich commanded all the districts of Lucca to range themselves the next\r\nmorning under their respective banners, that they might attack and expel\r\nby force those of the contrary party who should refuse to obey the\r\ndecree.\r\n\r\nRuggieri returned from the Piazza of the Podest\u00e0, accompanied by\r\nseveral of his principal friends. His wife, Madonna Dianora, was\r\nanxiously waiting his return; while the young Castruccio stood at the\r\ncasement, and, divining by his mother's countenance the cause of her\r\ninquietude, looked eagerly down the street that he might watch the\r\napproach of his father: he clapped his hands with joy, as he exclaimed,\r\n\"They come!\" Ruggieri entered; his wife observed him inquiringly and\r\ntenderly, but forbore to speak; yet her cheek became pale, when she\r\nheard her husband issue orders, that the palace should be barricadoed,\r\nand none permitted to enter, except those who brought the word which\r\nshewed that they belonged to the same party.\r\n\r\n\"Are we in danger?\"--asked Madonna Dianora in a low voice of one of\r\ntheir most intimate friends. Her husband overheard her, and replied:\r\n\"Keep up your courage, my best girl; trust me, as you have ever trusted.\r\nI would that I dared send you to a place of safety, but it were not well\r\nthat you traversed the streets of Lucca; so you must share my fortunes,\r\nDianora.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I not ever shared them?\" replied his wife. His friends had retired\r\nto an adjoining hall, and she continued;--\"There can be no dearer fate\r\nto me than to live or perish with you, Ruggieri; but cannot we save our\r\nson?\"\r\n\r\nCastruccio was sitting at the feet of his parents, and gazing on them\r\nwith his soft, yet bright eyes. He had looked at his mother as she\r\nspoke; now he turned eagerly towards his father while he listened to his\r\nreply:--\"We have been driven from the Piazza of the Podest\u00e0, and we can\r\nno longer entertain any hope of overcoming our enemies. The mildest fate\r\nthat we may expect is confiscation and banishment; if they decree our\r\ndeath, the stones of this palace alone divide us from our fate. And\r\nCastruccio,--could any of our friends convey him hence, I should feel\r\nredoubled courage--but it is too much to risk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" said the boy, \"I am only a child, and can do no good; but I\r\npray you do not send me away from you: indeed, dear, dearest mother, I\r\nwill not leave you.\"\r\n\r\nThe trampling of horses was heard in the streets: Ruggieri started up;\r\none of his friends entered:--\"It is the guard going to the gates,\" said\r\nhe; \"the assembly of the people is broken up.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is decreed?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one ventures near to inquire out that; but courage, my noble lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"That word to me, Ricciardo?--but it is well; my wife and child make a\r\nvery woman of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ave Maria_ is now ringing,\" replied his companion; \"soon night will\r\nset in, and, if you will trust me, I will endeavour to convey Madonna\r\nDianora to some place of concealment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Many thanks, my good Ricciardo,\" answered the lady; \"my safest post is\r\nat the side of Ruggieri. But our boy----save him, and a mother's\r\nblessing, her warm, heartfelt thanks, all the treasure that I can give,\r\nshall be yours! You know Valperga?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the castle of Valperga. Is the Countess there now?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is,--and she is our friend; if my Castruccio were once within the\r\nwalls of that castle, I were happy.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Madonna Dianora conversed thus with Ricciardo, Ruggieri held a\r\nconsultation with his friends. The comfortable daylight had faded away,\r\nand night brought danger and double fear along with it. The companions\r\nof Ruggieri sat in the banqueting hall of his palace, debating their\r\nfuture conduct: they spoke in whispers, for they feared that a louder\r\ntone might overpower any sound in the streets; and they listened to\r\nevery footfall, as if it were the tread of their coming destiny.\r\nRicciardo joined them; and Madonna Dianora was left alone with her son:\r\nthey were silent. Dianora wept, and held the hand of her child; while he\r\ntried to comfort her, and to show that fortitude he had often heard his\r\nfather praise; but his little bosom swelled in despite of his mastery,\r\nuntil, the big tears rolling down his cheeks, he threw himself into his\r\nmother's arms, and sobbed aloud. At this moment some one knocked\r\nviolently at the palace-gate. The assembled Ghibelines started up, and\r\ndrew their swords as they rushed towards the staircase; and they stood\r\nin fearful silence, while they listened to the answers which the\r\nstranger gave to him who guarded the door.\r\n\r\nRuggieri had embraced his wife he feared for the last time. She did not\r\nthen weep; her high wrought feelings were fixed on one object alone, the\r\nsafety of her child.--\"If you escape,\" she cried, \"Valperga is your\r\nrefuge; you well know the road that leads to it.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy did not answer for a while; and then he whispered, while he\r\nclung round her neck,--\"You, dear mother, shall shew it to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice of the man who had disturbed them by his knocking, had\r\nreassured the imprisoned Ghibelines, and he was admitted. It was Marco,\r\nthe servant of Messer Antonio dei Adimari. A Florentine by birth, and a\r\nGuelph, Antonio had retired from his native city while it continued\r\nunder the jurisdiction of the opposite party, and had lived at the\r\ncastle of Valperga, of which his wife was Countess and Castellana. He\r\nwas bound to Ruggieri by the strongest ties of private friendship; and\r\nhe now exerted himself to save his friend. Marco brought intelligence of\r\nthe decree of the assembly of the people. \"Our lives are then in\r\nsafety,\"--cried Dianora, with a wild look of joy,--\"and all the rest is\r\nas the seared leaves of autumn; they fall off lightly, and make no\r\nnoise.\"\r\n\r\n\"The night wears apace,\" said Marco, \"and before sunrise you must\r\ndepart; will you accompany me to Valperga?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so,\" replied Ruggieri; \"we may be beggars, but we will not burthen\r\nour friends. Thank your lord for his many kindnesses towards me. I leave\r\nit to him to save what he can for me from the ruins of my fortune. If\r\nhis interest stand high enough with our rulers, intreat him to exert it\r\nto preserve the unoffending walls of this palace: it was the dwelling of\r\nmy forefathers, my inheritance; I lived here during my boyish days; and\r\nonce its hall was graced by the presence of Manfred. My boy may one day\r\nreturn; and I would not that he should find the palace of his father a\r\nruin. We cannot remain near Lucca, but shall retire to some town which\r\nadheres to our party, and there wait for better days.\"\r\n\r\nDianora made speedy preparations for their departure; the horses were\r\nbrought to the door; and the stars were fading in the light of dawn, as\r\nthe cavalcade proceeded through the high and narrow streets of Lucca.\r\nTheir progress was unimpeded at the gates; Ruggieri felt a load taken\r\nfrom his heart, when he found himself, with his wife and child, safe in\r\nthe open country. Yet the feeling of joy was repressed by the\r\nremembrance, that life was all that remained to them, and that poverty\r\nand obscurity were to be the hard-visaged nurses of their declining\r\nyears, the harsh tutors of the young and aspiring Castruccio.\r\n\r\nThe exiles pursued their way slowly to Florence.\r\n\r\nFlorence was then in a frightful state of civil discord. The Ghibelines\r\nhad the preponderance; but not a day passed without brawls and\r\nbloodshed. Our exiles found many of their townsmen on the same road, on\r\nthe same sad errand of seeking protection from a foreign state. Little\r\nCastruccio saw many of his dearest friends among them; and his young\r\nheart, moved by their tears and complaints, became inflamed with rage\r\nand desire of vengeance. It was by scenes such as these, that party\r\nspirit was generated, and became so strong in Italy. Children, while\r\nthey were yet too young to feel their own disgrace, saw the misery of\r\ntheir parents, and took early vows of implacable hatred against their\r\npersecutors: these were remembered in after times; the wounds were never\r\nseared, but the fresh blood ever streaming kept alive the feelings of\r\npassion and anger which had given rise to the first blow.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at Florence, they were welcomed with kindness by the\r\nchiefs of the _Bianchi_ of that city. Charles of Valois had just sent\r\nambassadors to the government, to offer his mediation in composing their\r\ndifferences; and on that very day the party of Ghibelines who composed\r\nthe council assembled to deliberate on this insidious proposition. It\r\nmay be easily supposed therefore, that, entirely taken up with their own\r\naffairs, they could not bestow the attention they would otherwise have\r\ndone on the Lucchese exiles. On the following day Ruggieri left\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\nThe exiles proceeded to Ancona. This was the native town of the Lady\r\nDianora; and they were received with hospitality by her relations. But\r\nit was a heavy change for Ruggieri, to pass from the active life of the\r\nchief of a party, to the unmarked situation of an individual, who had no\r\ninterest in the government under which he lived, and who had exchanged\r\nthe distinctions of rank and wealth for that barren respect which an\r\nunblamed old age might claim. Ruggieri had been a man of undaunted\r\ncourage; and this virtue, being no longer called into action, assumed\r\nthe appearance of patience and fortitude. His dearest pleasure was the\r\nunceasing attention he paid to the education of his son. Castruccio was\r\nan apt and sprightly boy, bold in action, careless of consequences, and\r\ngoverned only by his affection for his parents. Ruggieri encouraged his\r\nadventurous disposition; and although he often sympathized in the fears\r\nof his anxious wife, when Castruccio would venture out to sea on a windy\r\nday in a little fair-weather skiff, or when he saw him, without bridle\r\nor saddle, mount a horse, and, heading a band of his companions, ride\r\noff to the woods, yet he never permitted himself to express these fears,\r\nor check the daring of his son.\r\n\r\nSo Castruccio grew up active; light and graceful of limb, trusting that\r\nby his own powers he should always escape. Yet the boy was not without\r\nprudence; he seemed to perceive instinctively the limits of possibility,\r\nand would often repress the fool-hardiness of his companions, and shew\r\nhis superior judgement and patience in surmounting the same difficulties\r\nby slower and safer means. Ruggieri disciplined him betimes in all the\r\nduties of a knight and a soldier; he wielded a lance adapted to his\r\nsize, shot with bow and arrows, and the necessary studies to which he\r\napplied, became, on account of their active nature, the source of\r\ninexhaustible amusement to him. Accompanied by a troop of lads, they\r\nwould feign some court surrounded by an old wall, or some ruined tower,\r\nto be Troy Town, or any other famous city of antient days, and then with\r\nmimic _balestri_, and slings and arrows, and lances, they attacked, and\r\ndefended, and practised those lessons in tactics which their preceptors\r\ninculcated at an early age.\r\n\r\nDuring the first year of their banishment his mother died; her weak\r\nframe was destroyed by hardship and disappointment. She recommended her\r\nson to his father in terms of tender love; and then closed her eyes in\r\npeace. This circumstance for a considerable time unhinged the young mind\r\nof Castruccio, and interrupted his studies. His father, who loved her\r\ntenderly, and who had found in her a friend to whom he could confide\r\nthose regrets which pride forbade him to impart to any other hearer, now\r\nlamented her with excessive grief.\r\n\r\nHe did not dare check the silent tear that started into the eye of\r\nCastruccio, when, returning from his exercises with his companions, he\r\nwas no longer embraced by his mother; he felt that his own sentiments\r\nwould refute the lesson he wished to impress.\r\n\r\nRuggieri was consoled for all his past misfortunes by the promising\r\ntalents and disposition of his son, and parental tenderness, the\r\nstrongest of all passions, but often the most unfortunate, was to him\r\nthe sunbeam, solitary, but bright, which enlightened his years of exile\r\nand infirmity.\r\n\r\nYet at the moment that he most enjoyed this blessing, his security was\r\nsuddenly disturbed. One morning Castruccio disappeared; and the\r\nfollowing perplexing note addressed to his father, was the only trace\r\nthat he left of his intentions:--\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, dearest father; I will return in a very few days; I am quite\r\nsafe, therefore do not disquiet yourself on my account. Do not be very\r\nangry with me; for, although I am indignant at my own weakness, I cannot\r\nresist! Be well assured that in less than a fortnight your unworthy son\r\nwill be at your feet.\r\n\r\n\"CASTRUCCIO.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the year 1304, when Castruccio was fourteen years of age.\r\nRuggieri hoped and trusted that he was safe, and that he would fulfil\r\nhis promise and soon return; but he waited with inexpressible anxiety.\r\nThe cause of Castruccio's flight was curious, shewing at once the\r\nmanners of the age and country in which they lived, and the imagination\r\nand disposition of the boy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Black and White.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\n_Castruccio visits Florence.--Characters of Euthanasia\r\ndei Adimari and her father.--The\r\nfather of Castruccio dies._\r\n\r\n\r\nA traveller had arrived at Ancona from Florence, and had diffused the\r\nintelligence that a strange and tremendous spectacle would be exhibited\r\nthere on the first of May of that year. It had been proclaimed in the\r\nstreets of the city, by a herald sent by the inhabitants of the quarter\r\nof San Frediano, that all who wished to have news from the other world,\r\nshould repair on the first of May to the bridge of Carraia or to the\r\nquay of the Arno. And he added, that he believed that preparations were\r\nmade to exhibit Hell, such as it had been described in a poem now\r\nwriting by Dante Alighieri, a part of which had been read, and had given\r\nrise to the undertaking.\r\n\r\nThis account raised the curiosity, and fired the imagination of\r\nCastruccio. The idea darted into his head that he would see this\r\nwonderful exhibition; and no sooner had he conceived the possibility of\r\ndoing so, than his determination was fixed. He dared not ask his\r\nfather's permission, for he knew that he should be refused; and, like\r\nmany others, he imagined that it was better to go, not having mentioned\r\nhis design, than to break a positive command. He felt remorse at leaving\r\nhis father; but curiosity was the stronger passion, and he was overcome:\r\nhe left a billet for Ruggieri; and, during the silence of a moonlight\r\nnight, he mounted his steed, and left Ancona. While proceeding through\r\nthe streets of the town, he several times repented, and thought that he\r\nwould return; but no sooner had he passed the walls, than he seemed to\r\nfeel the joy of liberty descending on him; and he rode on with wild\r\ndelight, while the mountains and their forests slept under the yellow\r\nmoon, and the murmur of the placid ocean was the only sound that he\r\nheard, except the trampling of his own horse's hoofs.\r\n\r\nRiding hard, and changing his horse on the road, he arrived in five days\r\nat Florence. He experienced a peculiar sensation of pleasure, as he\r\ndescended from the mountains into Tuscany. Alone on the bare Apennines,\r\nover which the fierce wind swept, he felt free; there was no one near\r\nhim to control his motions, to order him to stay or go; but his own will\r\nguided his progress, swift or slow, as the various thoughts that arose\r\nin his mind impelled him. He felt as if the air that quickly glided over\r\nhim, was a part of his own nature, and bore his soul along with it;\r\nimpulses of affection mingled with these inexplicable sensations; his\r\nthoughts wandered to his native town; he suffered his imagination to\r\ndwell upon the period when he might be recalled from exile, and to\r\nluxuriate in dreams of power and distinction.\r\n\r\nAt length he arrived at the fair city of Florence. It was the first of\r\nMay, and he hastened from his inn to the scene of action. As he\r\napproached, he observed the streets almost blocked up by the multitudes\r\nthat poured to the same spot; and, not being acquainted with the town,\r\nhe found that he had better follow the multitude, than seek a way of his\r\nown. Driven along by the crowd, he at length came in sight of the Arno.\r\nIt was covered by boats, on which scaffoldings were erected, hung with\r\nblack cloth, whose accumulated drapery lent life to the flames, which\r\nthe glare of day would otherwise have eclipsed. In the midst of these\r\nflames moved legions of ghastly and distorted shapes, some with horns of\r\nfire, and hoofs, and horrible wings; others the naked representatives of\r\nthe souls in torment; mimic shrieks burst on the air, screams and\r\ndemoniac laughter. The infernal drama was acted to the life; and the\r\nterrible effect of such a scene was enhanced, by the circumstance of its\r\nbeing no more than an actual representation of what then existed in the\r\nimagination of the spectators, endued with the vivid colours of a faith\r\ninconceivable in these lethargic days.\r\n\r\nCastruccio felt a chill of horror run through his frame; the scene\r\nbefore him appeared for a moment as a reality, rather than a\r\nrepresentation; the Arno seemed a yawning gulph, where the earth had\r\nopened to display the mysteries of the infernal world; when suddenly a\r\ntremendous crash stamped with tenfold horror the terrific mockery. The\r\nbridge of Carraia, on which a countless multitude stood, one above the\r\nother, looking on the river, fell. Castruccio saw its props loosening,\r\nand the curved arch shake, and with a sudden shriek he stretched out his\r\narms, as if he could save those who stood on it. It fell in with a\r\nreport that was reverberated from the houses that lined the Arno; and\r\neven, to the hills which close the valley, it rebellowed along the sky,\r\naccompanied by fearful screams, and voices that called on the names of\r\nthose whom they were never more to behold. The confusion was beyond\r\ndescription terrible; some flying, others pressing towards the banks of\r\nthe river to help the sufferers; all, as himself, seized with a\r\nsuperstitious dread, which rebuked them for having mimicked the dreadful\r\nmysteries of their religion, and which burst forth in clamorous\r\nexclamations and wild horror. The heroism of Castruccio failed; he\r\nseized with eagerness the opportunity of an opening in the crowd; and,\r\ngetting into a by street, ran with what speed he could, while his knees\r\nstill shook beneath him, from the spot he in the morning as eagerly\r\nsought. The sound of the shrieks began to die away on his ear before he\r\nslackened his speed.\r\n\r\nThe first idea that struck him, as he recovered his breath, was--\"I am\r\nescaped from Hell!\"--And seeing a church open, he with an instinctive\r\nimpulse entered its doors. He felt as if he fled from the powers of\r\nevil; and, if he needed protection, where should he seek it with more\r\nconfidence, than in the temple where the good God of the universe was\r\nworshipped? It was indeed as a change from Hell to Heaven, to have\r\nescaped from the jostling of the crowd, the dreadful spectacle of\r\nmimicked torments, the unearthly crash that bellowed like thunder along\r\nthe sky, and the shrieks of the dying--to the silence of the empty\r\nchurch, the faint smell of incense, and the few quiet lights that burned\r\non the high altar. Castruccio was seized with a feeling of awe as he\r\nwalked up the aisle; and conscience, alive at that moment, reproached\r\nhim bitterly for having quitted his father. When the idea struck\r\nhim--\"If I had been on that bridge,\"--he could no longer resist his\r\nemotions; tears ran fast down his cheeks, and he sobbed aloud.\r\n\r\nA man, whom he had not perceived before kneeling in a niche beside the\r\naltar, arose on hearing the voice of grief, and drew near the boy. \"Why\r\ndo you weep?\"--he said. Castruccio, who had not heard his approach,\r\nlooked up with surprise; for it was the voice of Marco, the servant of\r\nhis father's friend, Messer Antonio dei Adimari. Marco instantly\r\nrecognised him; for who that had once seen, could ever forget his dark\r\neyes, shaded by long, pointed lashes, his sun-bright hair, and his\r\ncountenance that beamed with sweet frankness and persuasion? The boy\r\nthrew himself into the arms of his humble, but affectionate friend, and\r\nwept there for some time. When he had become more calm, his story was\r\ntold in a few words. Marco was not inclined to find fault with an\r\nadventurous spirit, and soon consoled him.--\"You are safe,\"--he said;\r\n\"so there is no harm done. Come, this is rather a fortunate event than\r\notherwise; my lord and lady are in Florence; you shall stay a night with\r\nthem; and to-morrow morning we will send you home to your anxious\r\nfather.\"\r\n\r\nThe eyes of Castruccio sparkled with hope.--\"Euthanasia is here?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quick then, dear Marco, let us go.--How fortunate it was that I came to\r\nFlorence!\"\r\n\r\nThe life of Messer Antonio dei Adimari had been spent in the military\r\nand civil service of his country; he had often been _Priore_; and now,\r\nthat age and blindness had caused him to withdraw from the offices of\r\nthe state, his counsels were sought and acted upon by his successors. He\r\nhad married the only daughter of the Count of Valperga, a feudal chief\r\nwho possessed large estates in the territory of Lucca. His castle was\r\nsituated among the Apennines north of Lucca, and his estates consisted\r\nof a few scattered villages, raised on the peaks of mountains, and\r\nrendered almost inaccessible by nature as well as art.\r\n\r\nBy the death of her father the wife of Adimari became Countess and\r\nCastellana of the district; and the duties which this government imposed\r\nupon her, often caused the removal of her whole family from Florence to\r\nthe castle of Valperga. It was during these visits that Adimari renewed\r\na friendship that had before subsisted between him and Ruggieri dei\r\nAntelminelli. Messer Antonio was a Guelph, and had fought against\r\nManfred under the banners of the Pope: it happened during one campaign\r\nthat Ruggieri fell wounded and a prisoner into his hands; he attended\r\nhim with humanity; and, when he perceived that no care could restore him\r\nif separated from his prince, and that he languished to attend at the\r\nside of Manfred, he set him free; and this was the commencement of a\r\nfriendship, which improved by mutual good offices, and more than all by\r\nthe esteem that they bore one to the other, had long allied the two\r\nhouses, though of different parties, in the strictest amity.\r\n\r\nAdimari continued in the service of his country, until his infirmities\r\npermitted him to withdraw from these active and harassing duties, and,\r\ngiving up the idea of parties and wars, to apply himself exclusively to\r\nliterature. The spirit of learning, after a long sleep, that seemed to\r\nbe annihilation, awoke, and shook her wings over her favoured Italy.\r\nInestimable treasures of learning then existed in various monasteries,\r\nof the value of which their inhabitants were at length aware; and even\r\nlaymen began to partake of that curiosity, which made Petrarch but a few\r\nyears after travel round Europe to collect manuscripts, and to preserve\r\nthose wonderful writings, now mutilated, but which would otherwise have\r\nbeen entirely lost.\r\n\r\nAntonio dei Adimari enjoyed repose in the bosom of his family, his\r\nsolitude cheered by the converse which he held with the sages of Rome in\r\nages long past. His family consisted of his wife, two boys, and a girl\r\nonly two years younger than Castruccio. He and Euthanasia had been\r\neducated together almost from their cradle. They had wandered hand in\r\nhand among the wild mountains and chesnut woods that surrounded her\r\nmother's castle. Their studies, their amusements, were in common; and it\r\nwas a terrible blow to each when they were separated by the exile of the\r\nAntelminelli. Euthanasia, whose soul was a deep well of love, felt most,\r\nand her glistening eyes and infantine complaints told for many months,\r\neven years after, that she still remembered, and would never forget, the\r\nplaymate of her childhood.\r\n\r\nAt the period of this separation Adimari was threatened by a misfortune,\r\nthe worst that could befall a man of study and learning--blindness. The\r\ndisease gained ground, and in a year he saw nothing of this fair world\r\nbut an universal and impenetrable blank. In this dreadful state\r\nEuthanasia was his only consolation. Unable to attend to the education\r\nof his boys, he sent them to the court of Naples, to which he had before\r\nadhered, and in which he possessed many valued friends; and his girl\r\nalone remained to cheer him with her prattle; for the countess, his\r\nwife, a woman of high birth and party, did not sympathize in his\r\nsedentary occupations.--\"I will not leave you,\" said Euthanasia to him\r\none day, when he bade her go and amuse herself,--\"I am most pleased\r\nwhile talking with you. You cannot read now, or occupy yourself with\r\nthose old parchments in which you used to delight. But tell me, dear\r\nfather, could you not teach me to read them to you? You know I can read\r\nvery well, and I am never so well pleased as when I can get some of the\r\ntroubadour songs, or some old chronicle, to puzzle over. These to be\r\nsure are written in another language; but I am not totally unacquainted\r\nwith it; and, if you would have a little patience with me, I think I\r\nshould be able to understand these difficult authors.\"\r\n\r\nThe disabled student did not disdain so affectionate an offer. Every one\r\nin those days was acquainted with a rude and barbarous Latin, the\r\nknowledge of which Euthanasia now exchanged for the polished language of\r\nCicero and Virgil. A priest of a neighbouring chapel was her tutor; and\r\nthe desire of pleasing her father made her indefatigable in her\r\nexertions. The first difficulties being conquered, she passed whole days\r\nover these dusky manuscripts, reading to the old man, who found double\r\npleasure in the antient poets, as he heard their verses pronounced by\r\nhis beloved Euthanasia. The effect of this education on her mind was\r\nadvantageous and memorable; she did not acquire that narrow idea of the\r\npresent times, as if they and the world were the same, which\r\ncharacterizes the unlearned; she saw and marked the revolutions that had\r\nbeen, and the present seemed to her only a point of rest, from which\r\ntime was to renew his flight, scattering change as he went; and, if her\r\nvoice or act could mingle aught of good in these changes, this it was to\r\nwhich her imagination most ardently aspired. She was deeply penetrated\r\nby the acts and thoughts of those men, who despised the spirit of party,\r\nand grasped the universe in their hopes of virtue and independence.\r\n\r\nLiberty had never been more devotedly worshipped than in the republic of\r\nFlorence: the Guelphs boasted that their attachment to the cause of\r\nfreedom might rival what history records of the glorious days of\r\nantiquity. Adimari had allied himself to this party, because he thought\r\nhe saw in the designs and principles of its leaders the germ of future\r\nindependence for Italy. He had ever been a fervent advocate for the\r\nfreedom of his fellow citizens: but he caught the spirit with double\r\nfervour from the Roman writers; and often, not seeing the little fairy\r\nform that sat at his feet, he forgot the age of his companion, and\r\ntalked in high strains of that ennobling spirit which he felt in his\r\ninmost heart. Euthanasia heard and understood; her soul, adapted for the\r\nreception of all good, drained the cup of eloquent feeling that her\r\nfather poured out before her, and her eyes shone with the deep emotion.\r\nHer young thoughts darted into futurity, to the hope of freedom for\r\nItaly, of revived learning and the reign of peace for all the world:\r\nwild dreams, that still awake the minds of men to high song and glorious\r\naction.\r\n\r\nSuch was the education of the friend of Castruccio, while he learned all\r\nchivalrous accomplishments under the tuition of his noble father at\r\nAncona; and now, after three years absence, they met at Florence,\r\nneither having by forgetfulness wronged the friendship they had vowed in\r\ninfancy.\r\n\r\nWhen Marco led his young friend to the palace of Adimari, he found his\r\nmaster and the countess receiving the visits of some of the Guelph\r\nparty; and he knew that this was no time or place to introduce the young\r\nGhibeline. But, as they passed along the great hall, a sylph-like form\r\ncame from a room opposite, appearing as a star from behind a cloud.--\"I\r\nbring your exiled friend,\" said Marco; \"Castruccio dei Antelminelli is\r\ncome to visit you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Castruccio in Florence!\" cried Euthanasia; and she embraced him with\r\nsisterly affection, \"But how, dear friend, do you venture within these\r\nwalls?--is your father here?--but this is no place to ask all the\r\nquestions that I must hear resolved before you go. Come into this room;\r\nnone but my father will enter here; and now you shall tell me all that\r\nhas passed since you quitted Lucca.\"\r\n\r\nCastruccio gazed on Euthanasia: he could, he thought, feed for life on\r\nher sweet looks, in which deep sensibility and lively thought were\r\npictured, and a judgement and reason beyond her years. Her eyes seemed\r\nto read his soul, while they glistened with pleasure; he wished to hear\r\nher speak, but she insisted that his tale should be first told, of how\r\nhe had lived at Ancona, and how he had ventured to Florence. She gently\r\nreproached him for having left his father; and then said,--\"But I must\r\nnot play the hypocrite; I am glad you are come; for it gives me more\r\npleasure than I can express, to see you again. But I hear my father's\r\nstep; I must go and lead him, and tell him of the stranger-visitor he\r\nhas got.\"\r\n\r\nCastruccio enjoyed the most heartfelt pleasure, as he sat between\r\nEuthanasia and her father. Their manners towards him were affectionate,\r\nand their conversation best calculated to fill an exile's bosom with\r\nhope and joy. He was told by them, that if they now parted, he must look\r\nforward to the moment when he and his father should be recalled with\r\nhonour to their country. Adimari could not see the bright eyes and\r\nardent mien of the boy; but he heard with pleasure the detail of his\r\noccupations at Ancona, and easily perceived that his young mind slept\r\nnot on the present, dreamless of the future. He encouraged his\r\naspirations to honour, and exhorted him to be faithful to the lessons of\r\nhis father.\r\n\r\nThe charmed hours flew past, and the following morning they were to\r\nseparate. This consideration, as evening came on, threw more solemnity\r\ninto their looks and talk. Castruccio became pensive, and gazed on his\r\nfriend, as a treasure that he was about to lose, perhaps for ever.\r\nEuthanasia was silent; her eyes were bent to earth; and the varying\r\ncolour of her cheeks shewed that she was revolving some thought in her\r\nmind, to which she knew not how to give utterance. At length she raised\r\nher eyes, and said:--\"We part to-morrow, Castruccio, as we have before\r\nparted,--for many years I fear. But there are two kinds of separation.\r\nOne, during which we suffer time to obliterate the past, as we should if\r\ndeath, that parting to which no meeting succeeds, or a meeting in which\r\nall private ties are superseded, had been the cause of the separation.\r\nBut there is another; when we cherish the memory of the absent, and act\r\nfor them as if they were with us; when to remember is a paramount duty.\r\nThis is alone practicable between friends, when each in his meditations\r\nis sure that the other thinks also of him: then, methinks to reflect on\r\nthe words and looks of a friend, is as if one absolutely saw him. Let\r\nthis be our separation. We are both familiar with the ideas of virtue\r\nand self-sacrifice; let friendship be joined to these, to make all\r\nsacrifice light, and virtue more delightful. We are very young; we know\r\nnot what misfortunes are in store for us; what losses, perhaps what\r\ncalumnies, or even dishonour, may in after times taint our names. In\r\ncalumny it is to the friends of our youth that we must turn; for they\r\nalone can know how pure the heart is, with which they were acquainted at\r\nthe time when disguise could have no existence. They, if they are true,\r\ndare not leave us without consolation. Castruccio, I know that you will\r\nnever dishonour yourself: and, remember, if in any hard struggle you\r\nwant a friend who will console you by sympathy and confidence, and help\r\nyou as far as her power will permit, I will always be that friend to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nEuthanasia was yet a child, when she made this promise. But she saw\r\nCastruccio, the friend of her infancy, a youth of high birth and nobly\r\nbred, an outcast and an exile; she had heard and read how few friends\r\nthe unfortunate find, and generosity prompted those sentiments, to which\r\nthe frankness of her nature caused her to give utterance. She felt that\r\nCastruccio had a deep affection for her, and she hoped, that a promise\r\nthus voluntary and solemn; would be a consolation to him during\r\nadversity. He felt the kindness of her motive, and replied\r\nearnestly:--\"I am an exile, and can do no good to you who are\r\nprosperous; mine must be barren thanks. Yet not the less will I fulfil\r\nmy promise, if our fortunes change, of being your friend, your knight,\r\nyour rock, on whom you may build your hope and trust in every\r\nmisfortune.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning, accompanied by Marco, Castruccio quitted Florence. In\r\nhis mind there was a mixture of grief at having left, and joy at having\r\nonce more seen, Euthanasia. Every word that she had said, and every look\r\nof her lovely eyes, were treasured in his soul--to be a consolation and\r\nsupport in trouble, and an incentive to noble endeavour. Adimari had\r\ntaken an affectionate leave of him, telling him, that, as far as a poor\r\nblind man could, he would promote his interests, and seize the first\r\nopportunity, if such should offer, of procuring a repeal for his exile.\r\nThere was a kindness and distinction in the manner of his aged friend,\r\nthat touched the heart of the boy; and in after times he thought he\r\nperceived a hidden meaning in his last words, which he interpreted in a\r\nmanner that gave a sober steadiness to what he would otherwise have\r\nconsidered as another airy bubble of the enchantress Hope. \"Remember,\"\r\nsaid the venerable Florentine, \"that I approve of, and love you; and if\r\nyou become that which your talents and dawning virtues promise, you may\r\nin future be my elect favourite. Now, farewell; and do not forget me or\r\nmine!\"\r\n\r\nThus cheered, thus buoyed up by hopes of future good fortune and\r\nadvancement, which had before been too deeply mingled with fear,\r\nCastruccio returned with a light heart to his father, his soul more than\r\never bent upon improvement and the accomplishment of noble deeds. And\r\nnow, forgiven by his anxious parent for the grief he had occasioned him,\r\nhis days wore away, as they were wont, in delightful tasks.\r\n\r\nTime passed on, while our young esquire was preparing himself for his\r\nfuture career; strengthening his mind by study, and his body by toil.\r\nHis step assumed the firmness of one who does not fear, and who, with\r\nhis eye fixed on one point, will not be daunted by the shadows that flit\r\nbetween him and his desired sun. His eyes, before beaming with frankness\r\nand engaging sweetness, now sparkled with a profounder meaning. He\r\nentered his seventeenth year, and he was pondering upon the fit\r\nbeginning to his life, and hoping that his father would not oppose his\r\nfervent desire to quit what he thought a lifeless solitude; when, as a\r\nyoung bather, peeping from a rock, is pushed into the sea, and forced to\r\nexert the powers of which he was before only dreaming, so chance threw\r\nCastruccio from his quiet nook into the wide sea of care, to sink or\r\nswim, as fate or his own good strength might aid him.\r\n\r\nHis father died. A malignant fever, brought by some trading vessels from\r\nthe Levant, raged in the town of Ancona, and Ruggieri was one of its\r\nearliest victims. As soon as he was attacked, he knew he must die, and\r\nhe gazed upon his boy with deep tenderness and care. To be cast so young\r\non life, with a mind burning with ardour, and adorned with every\r\ngrace--the fair graces of youth, so easily and so irretrievably\r\ntarnished! He had commanded him not to come near him during his illness,\r\nwhich was exceedingly contagious: but finding that Castruccio waited on\r\nhim by stealth, he felt that it was in vain to oppose; and, only\r\nintreating him to use every imaginable precaution, they spent the last\r\nhours of Ruggieri's life together. The fever was too violent to permit\r\nany regular conversation; but the dying father exhorted him to remember\r\nhis former lessons, and lay them to his heart. \"I have written a\r\nletter,\" said he, \"which you will deliver to Francesco de Guinigi. He\r\nwas one of my dearest friends, and of high birth and fortune, in Lucca;\r\nbut now, like me, he is an exile, and has taken refuge at the town of\r\nEste in Lombardy. If he still preserves in adversity that generosity\r\nwhich before so highly distinguished him, you will less feel the loss of\r\nyour father. Go to him, my Castruccio, and be guided by his advice: he\r\nwill direct you how you can most usefully employ your time while an\r\noutcast from your country. Listen to him with the same deference that\r\nyou have always shown to me, for he is one of the few wise men who exist\r\nin this world, whose vanity and nothingness open upon me the more, now\r\nthat I am about to quit it.\"\r\n\r\nFrom time to time Ruggieri renewed his affectionate exhortations. His\r\nparental tenderness did not desert him in his last moments; and he died\r\nmaking a sign that in Heaven they should again meet. Castruccio was\r\noverwhelmed by grief at his loss. But grief was soon silenced by pain:\r\nhe had inhaled the pestilential air from the dying breath of his father,\r\nand was speedily like him stretched on the bed of sickness. Yet not like\r\nhim had he any tender nurse, to watch his fever, and administer to his\r\nwants: every one fled from the chance of death; and it was only the\r\nexcellent constitution of the boy that enabled him to recover.\r\n\r\nIn a month after his father's death, himself in appearance more dead\r\nthan alive, he crawled out from his apartment to breathe the enlivening\r\nair of the sea. A wind swept over it, and chilled his frame, while the\r\ndusky sky filled him with despondency. But this was a transient feeling:\r\nday by day he gained strength, and with strength and health returned the\r\nbuoyant spirits of youth. The first lively feeling that he experienced,\r\nwas an ardent desire to remove from Ancona. During his illness he had\r\nbitterly felt the absence of many whom he considered dear and firm\r\nfriends. When he was able to enquire for those whom he had inwardly\r\nreproached as false, he found that they were dead. The pestilence had\r\nvisited them, and felled them to the ground, while he, bruised and half\r\nbroken, raised his head when the deadly visitation was over. These\r\ndisappointments and losses pressed on his soul; and he experienced that\r\nfeeling which deceives us at every age, that by change of place, he\r\ncould exchange his unhappy sensations for those of a more genial nature.\r\nThe rainy season had begun; but he would not delay his departure; so,\r\ntaking an agonizing farewell of the graves of his friends, and of those\r\nof his beloved parents whom he could never see more, he left Ancona.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the mountains and the picturesque views for a while\r\nbeguiled his thoughts. He passed through the country where Asdrubal, the\r\nbrother of Hannibal, was defeated and slain on the mountain which still\r\nbears his name. A river runs at the base; and it was clothed by trees\r\nnow yellow and red, tinged thus by the winds of autumn, except where a\r\ncluster of ilexes gave life to the scenery. As he advanced, the rains\r\npoured down, and the hills, now more distant, were hid in mist; while\r\ntowards the east the gloomy Adriatic filled the air with its restless\r\nmurmurs. Castruccio had passed swiftly through this country before, when\r\nhe went to the _Festa d'Inferno_ at Florence. It was then adorned by the\r\nfresh spring; the sunbeams illuminated the various folds of the\r\nmountains, and the light waves coursed one another, dancing under the\r\ndazzling light. Castruccio remembered this; and he gazed sullenly on the\r\nsky obscured by a thick woof of black clouds, and reproached that with\r\nchanging, as his fortune changed. Yet, reflecting on the chances that\r\nhad occurred during his last journey, his imagination wandered to\r\nEuthanasia, and paused there, resting with delight on her beloved image.\r\n\r\nHe passed through many towns, among which he had no friends, and sought\r\nfor none. Yet, if he had desired protection, several of these were ruled\r\nby Ghibeline lords, who would have welcomed him with hospitality. Rimini\r\nwas then governed by the husband of Francesca, whose hapless fate is\r\nimmortalized by Dante. She was dead; but the country people, with a\r\nmixture of pity and religious horror, still spoke of her as the\r\nloveliest creature that had ever dwelt on earth, yet for whose lost\r\nsoul, condemned to eternal pains, they dared not even pray.\r\n\r\nCastruccio journeyed slowly on. He was weak and unable to endure\r\ncontinued exercise. Yet his mind recovered by degrees its wonted\r\nstrength; and imagination, ever at work, pictured his future life,\r\nbrilliant with glowing love, transcendant with glory and success. Thus,\r\nin solitude, while no censuring eye could check the exuberant vanity, he\r\nwould throw his arms to the north, the south, the east, and the west,\r\ncrying,--\"There--there--there, and there, shall my fame reach!\"--and\r\nthen, in gay defiance, casting his eager glance towards heaven:--\"and\r\neven there, if man may climb the slippery sides of the arched palace of\r\neternal fame, there also will I be recorded.\"\r\n\r\nHe was yet a boy in his seventeenth year when he said this. His desires\r\nwere afterwards to a considerable extent fulfilled: would he not have\r\nbeen happier, if they had failed, and he, in blameless obscurity, had\r\nsunk with the millions that compose the nations of the earth, into the\r\nvast ocean of oblivion? The sequel of his history must solve the riddle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\n_Francis Guinigi, the military Peasant.--Castruccio\r\nresides with him one Year._\r\n\r\n\r\nCastruccio passed through Bologna, Ferrara and Rovigo, to arrive at\r\nEste. It was not the most favourable period for a visit to Lombardy. The\r\nbeauty of that country consists in its exquisite vegetation: its fields\r\nof waving corn, planted with rows of trees to which vines are festooned,\r\nform prospects, ever varying in their combinations, that delight and\r\nrefresh the eye; but autumn had nearly stript the landscape, and the low\r\nlands were overflowed by the inundation of various rivers. Castruccio's\r\nmind, fixed on the imagination of future events, found no amusement in\r\nthe wintry scene; but he saw with delight the mountains that were the\r\nbourn of his journey, become more and more distinct. Este is situated\r\nnearly at the foot of the Euganean hills, on a declivity overlooked by\r\nan extensive and picturesque castle, beyond which is a convent; the\r\nhills rise from behind, from whose heights you discover the vast plain\r\nof Lombardy, bounded to the west by the far Apennines of Bologna, and to\r\nthe east by the sea and the towers of Venice.\r\n\r\nCastruccio ascended the hill immediately above the town, to seek for the\r\nhabitation of Guinigi. The autumnal wind swept over it, scattering the\r\nfallen leaves of the chesnut wood; and the swift clouds, driven over the\r\nboundless plain, gave it the appearance, as their shadows came and went,\r\nof a heaving sea of dusky waters. Castruccio found Guinigi sitting at\r\nthe door of his house; it was a low-roofed cottage, that seemed more fit\r\nfor the habitation of a peasant, than of a man bred in camps and\r\npalaces. Guinigi himself was about forty years of age: the hardships of\r\nwar had thinned the locks on his temples before their time, and drawn a\r\nfew lines in his face, beaming as it was with benevolence. The sparkling\r\nintelligence of his eye was tempered by gentleness and wisdom; and the\r\nstately mien of the soldier had yielded somewhat to his late rustic\r\noccupations; for, since his exile he had turned his sword to a\r\nploughshare, and he dwelt with much complacency on the change.\r\n\r\nAs Castruccio first saw him, he was gazing with the most heartfelt and\r\nbenevolent pleasure on his boy, a child of seven years of age, who was\r\nbusy with the peasants, drawing off wine from the vats; for it was just\r\nthe time when the vintage was finished, and the last labours were\r\nbestowed on the crushed grapes. The youth paused: but for the air of\r\ndignity that was visible beneath his rustic dress, he could not have\r\nbelieved that this was his father's friend; his father, who in exile\r\nnever forgot that he was a soldier and a knight. He gave the letter;\r\nand, when Guinigi had read it, he embraced the orphan son of his old\r\ncomrade, and welcomed him with a cordiality that warmed the heart of\r\nCastruccio. The name of a stranger soon struck the ear of Arrigo, his\r\nlittle son, who came with joy to greet him, bearing a large basket of\r\ngrapes and figs. Guinigi was much amused by the evident astonishment\r\nwith which his guest regarded the appearance of the house and its\r\nmaster, and said:--\"You come to the dwelling of a peasant who eats the\r\nbread his own hands have sown; this is a new scene for you, but you will\r\nnot find it uninstructive. To my eyes, which do not now glance with the\r\nsame fire as yours, the sight of the bounties of nature, and of the\r\nharmless peasants who cultivate the earth, is far more delightful than\r\nan army of knights hasting in brilliant array to deluge the fields with\r\nblood, and to destroy the beneficial hopes of the husbandman. But these\r\nare new doctrines to you; and you perhaps will never, like me, in the\r\ndeep sincerity of your heart, prefer this lowly cottage to yonder\r\nmajestic castle.\"\r\n\r\nTo say the truth, Castruccio was greatly disappointed. As he had\r\nascended from the town, and saw a gay banner waving from the keep of the\r\ncastle, as he heard the clash of armour, and beheld the sun-beams\r\nglitter on the arms of the centinel, he hoped that he should find his\r\nfuture protector a favourite with the happy chief. He would, he felt,\r\nhave accosted him with more respect, if he had found him a monk in the\r\nneighbouring monastery, than a contented farmer, a peasant whose narrow\r\nviews soared not beyond the wine-vat and the ox's stall.\r\n\r\nThese were the first feelings that occurred to Castruccio; but he soon\r\nfound that he was introduced to a new world in the society of Guinigi; a\r\nworld with whose spring of action he could not sympathize, yet which he\r\ncould not contemn. It was characterized by a simple yet sublime\r\nmorality, which resting on natural bases, admitted no factitious\r\ncolouring. Guinigi thought only of the duty of man to man, laying aside\r\nthe distinctions of society, and with lovely humility recognized the\r\naffinity of the meanest peasant to his own noble mind. Exercising the\r\nmost exalted virtues, he also cultivated a taste and imagination that\r\ndignified what the vulgar would term ignoble, as the common clouds of\r\nday become fields of purple and gold, painted by the sun at eve. His\r\nfancy only paused, when he would force it to adorn with beauty vice,\r\ndeath, and misery, when disguised by a kingly robe, by the trappings of\r\na victorious army, or the false halo of glory spread over the smoking\r\nruins of a ravaged town. Then his heart sickened, and the banners of\r\ntriumph or the song of victory could not drive from his recollection the\r\nvarieties of death, and the groans of torture that occasion such\r\nexultation to the privileged murderers of the earth.\r\n\r\nWhen Guinigi and Castruccio became intimate, the youth would reason with\r\nhim, and endeavour to prove, that in the present distracted state of\r\nmankind, it was better that one man should get the upper hand, to rule\r\nthe rest. \"Yes,\" said Guinigi, \"let one man, if it be forbidden to more\r\nthan one, get the upper hand in wisdom, and let him teach the rest:\r\nteach them the valuable arts of peace and love.\"\r\n\r\nGuinigi was a strange enthusiast. Men, like Alexander and other\r\nconquerors, have indulged the hope of subduing the world, and spreading\r\nby their triumphs refinement into its barbarous recesses. Guinigi hoped,\r\nhow futilely! to lay a foundation-stone for the temple of peace among\r\nthe Euganean hills. He had an overflowing affection of soul that could\r\nnot confine itself to the person of his son, or the aggrandizement of\r\nhis country, or be spiritualized into a metaphysical adoration of ideal\r\nbeauty. It bestowed itself on his fellow-creatures; and to see them\r\nhappy, warmed his heart with a pleasure experienced by few. This man,\r\nhis imaginative flights, his glowing benevolence and his humble\r\noccupations, were an enigma that Castruccio could never solve. But,\r\nwhile he neither sympathized with nor understood him, he quickly loved\r\nhim with the warmest affection.\r\n\r\nCastruccio wished to speak to him of his future destination; Guinigi\r\nsaid, \"Your father has recommended you to my counsels, and you must\r\nallow me to become acquainted with you, before I can give you advice.\r\nYou are very young; and we need not hurry. Grant me six months; we will\r\nnot be idle. We will ramble about the country: winter is the peasant's\r\nleisure time, so I am quite at your service. We shall be much together,\r\nand will discuss many subjects; and by degrees I shall understand the\r\nfoundations on which you are to build your future life.\"\r\n\r\nThey travelled to Padua, to lovely Venice, raising its head from the\r\nwaves of ocean; they rambled about the coast for days together, having\r\nno other end than to enjoy the beauties of nature. Then, coming nearer\r\nhome, they climbed the Euganean hills, and penetrated their recesses.\r\nGuinigi had an ultimate object in view; he wished to impress on the mind\r\nof his pupil a love of peace, and a taste for rural pleasures. One day\r\nthey were on the summit of Monte Selice, a conical hill between Este and\r\nPadua, and Guinigi pointed to the country around.--\"What a Paradise is\r\nthis!\" he said. \"Now it is bare; but in the summer, when the corn waves\r\namong the trees, and the ripening grapes shade the roads; when on every\r\nside you see happy peasants leading the beautiful oxen to their light\r\nwork, and the sun, and the air, and the earth are each labouring to\r\nproduce for man all that is necessary for his support, and the ground is\r\ncovered with vegetation, and the air quickened into life, it is a spot,\r\non which the Creator of the world might pause, and be pleased with his\r\nwork. How different was this some years ago! You have heard of Ezzelino\r\nthe tyrant of Padua, under whose auspices the rivers ran blood, and the\r\nunfortunate peasant found his harvests reaped by the sword of the\r\ninvading soldier! Look at those peasants on yonder road, conducting\r\ntheir cattle crowned with flowers: habited in their holiday best, and\r\nmoving in solemn procession; their oxen are going to be blest by St.\r\nAntonio, to ward from them the evils of the ensuing seasons. A few years\r\nago, instead of peasants, soldiers marched along that road: their close\r\nranks shewed their excellent discipline; their instruments filled the\r\nair with triumphant sounds; the knights pricked their steeds forward,\r\nwho arching their proud necks, seemed to exult in their destination.\r\nWhat were they about to do? to burn a town, to murder the old, and the\r\nhelpless, the women, and the children; to destroy the dwellings of\r\npeace; so that, when they left their cruel work, the miserable wretches\r\nwho survived had nothing to shelter them but the bare, black walls,\r\nwhere before their neat cottages had stood.\"\r\n\r\nCastruccio listened impatiently, and cried:--\"Yet who would not rather\r\nbe a knight, than one of those peasants, whose minds are as grovelling\r\nas their occupations?\"\r\n\r\n\"That would not I,\" replied Guinigi fervently; \"how must the human mind\r\nbe distorted, which can delight in that which is ill, in preference to\r\nthe cultivation of the earth, and the contemplation of its loveliness!\r\nWhat a strange mistake is it, that a peasant's life is incompatible with\r\nintellectual improvement! Alas! poor wretches; they are too hard-worked\r\nnow to learn much, and their toil, uncheered by the applause of their\r\nfellow-creatures, appears a degradation; yet, when I would picture\r\nhappiness upon earth, my imagination conjures up the family of a dweller\r\namong the fields, whose property is secure, and whose time is passed\r\nbetween labour and intellectual pleasures. Such now is my fate. The\r\nevening of my life steals gently on; and I have no regrets for the past,\r\nno wish for the future, but to continue as I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" cried Castruccio, \"You have passed through life, and know what it\r\nis; but I would rather, while alive, enter my tomb, than live unknown\r\nand unheard of. Is it not fame that makes men gods? Do not urge me to\r\npass my days in indolence; I must act, to be happy,--to be any thing. My\r\nfather did not wish me to become a farmer and a vinedresser; but to\r\ntread in his steps, and go beyond them, and that is my purpose, which I\r\nwould die to attain.\"\r\n\r\nA year passed while Castruccio still lived under the low roof of\r\nGuinigi. He found that it was no vain boast, that this noble ate the\r\nbread that he had sown: for he saw him hold the plough, trim his vines,\r\nand enter into all the labours of the husbandman. There is something\r\npicturesque in the toil of an Italian peasant. It is not, as in more\r\nnorthern climates, where cold, and wet, and care are endured, to be\r\nscantily repaid; and their unceasing anxiety is often terminated by the\r\ndestruction of their crops through the severity of their climate.\r\nGuinigi and his fellow-labourers rose with the sun, which, ascending\r\nfrom the ocean, illumined the wide plain with its slant beams. The most\r\nbeautiful vegetation luxuriated around them: the strips of land were\r\nplanted with Indian corn, wheat and beans; they were divided, in some\r\nplaces by row of olives, in others by elms or Lombardy poplars, to which\r\nthe vines clung. The hedges were of myrtle, whose aromatic perfume\r\nweighed upon the sluggish air of noon, as the labourers reposed,\r\nsleeping under the trees, lulled by the rippling of the brooks that\r\nwatered their grounds. In the evening they ate their meal under the open\r\nsky; the birds were asleep, but the ground was alive with innumerable\r\nglowworms, and the air with the lightning-like fire-flies, small,\r\nhumming crickets, and heavy beetles: the west had quickly lost its\r\nsplendour, but in the fading beams of subset sailed the boat-like moon,\r\nwhile Venus, as another satellite to earth, beamed just above the\r\ncrescent hardly brighter than itself, and the outline of the rugged\r\nApennines was marked darkly below.\r\n\r\nTheir harvests were plenteous and frequent. The moving of the grass was\r\nquickly followed in June by the reaping, and the well-trodden threshing\r\nfloor, such as Virgil describes it, received the grain; then came the\r\nharvest of the Indian corn; and last the glorious vintage, when the\r\nbeautiful dove-coloured oxen of Lombardy could hardly drag the creaking\r\nwains laden with the fruit.\r\n\r\nCastruccio attended Guinigi in his labours; and Guinigi, resting on his\r\nspade, would moralize on all around him, and win the ardent imagination\r\nof the youth to follow his flights. All in the country bore for him the\r\nimmediate stamp of divine and eternal beauty; he knew every flower of\r\nthe field, and could describe their various habits, and what insects\r\nbest loved to suck their nectar. He knew the form and the life of every\r\nlittle being of that peopled region, where the sun seems to quicken\r\nevery atom into life; and that which was insignificant to common eyes,\r\nappeared to him to be invested with strange attributes and uncommon\r\nloveliness.\r\n\r\nAgain Guinigi sat, Castruccio beside him, at the door of his cot,\r\nwatching the evening work of the labourers, as the wine was drawn off\r\nfrom the last vat. Arrigo, now a year older, was helping them:\r\nCastruccio said--\"Instead of six months I have given you twelve, and I\r\nhave not mentioned my future destiny; indeed we have been employed so\r\npleasantly during the summer, that I almost forgot it. But I cannot live\r\nanother year among these hills; you know not what bitterness I feel at\r\nheart, when I hear the clash of arms from that castle, I, who am wearing\r\naway an ignoble youth.\"\r\n\r\nGuinigi smiled, and replied, \"I have reflected for you, and I have dived\r\ninto your secret thoughts, although you have not spoken. To-morrow we\r\nwill make a journey; and you shall soon be introduced to a man who will\r\nbring you into that life whose promise of glory is so attractive to you.\r\nSo bid farewell to these hills; you will not see them again for many\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\nThis hope stole sleep from the eyes of Castruccio that night. His\r\nimagination, which had lately rested on sickles, and wains, and vines,\r\nand the simple philosophy of Guinigi, now again fled to its wonted\r\ntrack, and entered upon what he conceived to be a more glorious world.\r\nFleecy clouds hid the full moon, and the world was invested by a faint\r\nlight that gradually opened into day. Castruccio saw the horses led\r\nsaddled to the door, and he hastened to join Guinigi. Before he departed\r\nhe kissed affectionately the sleeping Arrigo, and said: \"I fear those\r\nfair eyes will be dimmed with tears, when he hears that I am not to\r\nreturn. Sweet boy! I love you as a brother, and hope some future day to\r\nshew that love in something more than words.\"\r\n\r\nGuinigi smiled at the aspiring spirit of Castruccio; he smiled to\r\nperceive that, still wanting protection, still a boy, his thoughts\r\nalways dwelt on the power which he would one day acquire, and the\r\nprotection he would then afford to others.\r\n\r\nThey rode silently along the well known road that led to Padua: after\r\nresting their horses at this town, they continued their way to Venice.\r\nWho knows not Venice? its streets paved with the eternal ocean, its\r\nbeautiful domes and majestic palaces? It is not now as it was when\r\nCastruccio visited it; now the degenerate inhabitants go \"crouching and\r\ncrab-like through their sapping streets:\" then they were at the height\r\nof their glory, just before the aristocratical government was fixed, and\r\nthe people were struggling for what they lost--liberty.\r\n\r\nGuinigi and his young companion were silent during their long ride.\r\nGuinigi was on the eve of seeing the friends of his warlike youth; and\r\nperhaps his memory recalled those scenes. Castruccio dreamed of\r\nfuturity; and the uncertainty of his destiny only gave more scope to his\r\nimagination, as he figured the glorious part which he flattered himself\r\nhe was about to act on the great theatre. At length they arrived on the\r\nshore of the Laguna, and entered the gondola which was to convey them to\r\nthe city. Guinigi then addressed the youth:--\"You trust your fate to me;\r\nand I must explain to you the plan that I have formed concerning you,\r\nthat you may judge whether I merit the entire confidence you shew\r\nyourself inclined to repose in me. You know, my dear Castruccio, that\r\npoor Italy is distracted by civil brawls, and how little honour one who\r\nis exiled as you are from his native town, can acquire, to whatever\r\nparty he may adhere. His most arduous exertions may be sacrificed to\r\npolitical intrigue, and assuredly he will be repaid with ingratitude\r\nalone, whatever power he serves. In addition, a disgraceful political\r\ncraft now reigns in the palaces of the Italian princes, which renders\r\nthem ill schools for a youth, who, while he may, ought to preserve the\r\ninnocence and sincerity of which the world will but too quickly deprive\r\nhim. You would inevitably be disgusted by the narrow views, the\r\ntreachery, and beggarly fraud, that dwell in the hearts, and influence\r\nthe actions of our proudest nobles.\r\n\r\n\"You must therefore begin your knightly career out of Italy. The honours\r\nthat you will obtain from a foreign sovereign, will ennoble you in the\r\neyes of your countrymen, and will enable you, when you return, to judge\r\nimpartially of the state of your country, and to choose, without being\r\ninfluenced by narrow party-feeling, the course you will pursue. It is\r\nwith this view that I am going to introduce you to an old friend of\r\nmine, an Englishman, who is about to return to his native soil. I knew\r\nhim many years ago, when he accompanied Charles of Anjou to Italy. A\r\nlong time has elapsed since sir Ethelbert Atawel returned to England;\r\nbut, upon the event of a new king's succession to the throne, he was\r\nchosen, as a person well acquainted with the customs of the holy court,\r\nto be the chief of an embassy to the Pope. Having discharged his\r\nmission, he has crossed the Alps to take a last farewell of his Italian\r\nfriends, before he proceeds to assume a distinguished part in his own\r\ncountry. I shall consign you, my young friend, to the guidance of this\r\nnoble gentleman. We have now been separated for nearly twenty years; but\r\nour attachment did not arise from casual intercourse alone; we esteemed\r\none another, we bound ourselves one to the other by vows; and, although\r\nat this distance of time, life has much changed its appearance to both\r\nof us, yet I swear I would keep to the letter all that I vowed to him,\r\nand I believe that he will do the same by me.\r\n\r\n\"Another motive influences me in sending you to England. You have a rich\r\nrelation there named Alderigo, who requested Atawel to enquire for the\r\nvarious branches of the exiled Antelminelli, and in particular for your\r\nfather. It may well appear from the earnestness of his enquiries, that,\r\nif you go to England, you will find yourself neither friendless nor\r\npoor. I am an exile like you, and like you I am destitute of all\r\nresources, and am saved from embarrassment only by those labours in\r\nwhich I fortunately take a pride. I know that it would not be agreeable\r\nto you to be dependent on the favour of Atawel; but you are differently\r\ncircumstanced with regard to your relation; and I believe him to have\r\nboth the power and the will to serve you.\"\r\n\r\nThe gondola entered Canale Grande, and rested at the steps of a noble\r\npalace. Castruccio had no time to comment upon the relation of Guinigi;\r\nbut followed him silently through the stately apartments, hung with silk\r\nand tapestry, and paved with marble, into the banquetting hall, where\r\nthe owner of the palace sat surrounded by the aristocracy of Venice. The\r\nchildish mind of Castruccio shrunk into itself, when he saw the satined\r\nand gold-laced state of these nobles, and then glanced his eye on the\r\ndignified form of his companion clothed in the mean habiliments of an\r\nItalian peasant: but his shame was turned to pride and astonishment,\r\nwhen he found this homely-looking man received with reverence, and\r\nembraced with affection, by this lordly assembly. The most cordial\r\nsalutes echoed from the ends of the hall, as they all pressed round to\r\nwelcome their old friend and counsellor, to whose wisdom and calm\r\ncourage many of them owed the most important obligations. There was a\r\nsweetness in the smile of Guinigi, that elevated him in appearance above\r\nother men, a sensibility beaming in his eye which added grace to his\r\nquick and expressive motions, and a gentleness that tempered the\r\nfrankness of his manners. He introduced Castruccio to the nobles. The\r\nyouth was beautiful to a wonder, and experienced a flattering reception\r\nfrom the friends of his protector.\r\n\r\n\"I shall remain but a few days in Venice,\" said Guinigi to his host;\r\n\"but I will visit you again before I retire to my farm; at present you\r\nmust tell me where I can find your English visitor, sir Ethelbert\r\nAtawel, for my business is with him.\"\r\n\r\nA man now arose, and advanced from a retired part of the room; his\r\nperson formed a strange contrast to the sun-burnt faces and black eyes\r\nof the Italians who were around him. He had the round Saxon features,\r\nmoulded with uncommon delicacy; his light hair slightly shaded his fair\r\ntemples; and his slender person denoted elegance rather than power; his\r\ncountenance bore the expression of much thought, of thoughts moulded by\r\nan enquiring, yet a gentle mind. He advanced towards Guinigi; his lips\r\nwere almost convulsed; a tear stole into his eye, as he grasped his\r\nhand, and said: \"You do not forget me?\"\r\n\r\nGuinigi replied with trembling emphasis, \"Never!\"--the hearts of the\r\nfriends were full, they took leave of the company, and descended to the\r\ngondola, that without spectators they might express their remembered\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\n_Castruccio in England._\r\n\r\n\r\nCastruccio spent several days with his friend at Venice. Guinigi and\r\nAtawel were constantly together, and Castruccio was thrown to a great\r\ndegree into the society of the Venetian nobles. Having been for a year\r\nthe constant companion of Guinigi, the contrast between him and these\r\nmen struck him forcibly. The mind of the philosophical exile was fraught\r\nwith a natural wisdom, a freedom from prejudice, and a boldness of\r\nthought, that suited the enthusiasm, while it corrected the narrow views\r\nof Castruccio. But these nobles were full of party spirit, and a never\r\nresting desire, to aggrandize first themselves, and secondly their\r\nnative town, in opposition to the rest of the world. They were to\r\nthemselves the centre of the universe, and men and nations rose and set\r\nonly for them. As Galileo was persecuted for saying that the earth moved\r\nattendant on the sun, thus demonstrating the relative insignificance of\r\nour globe; so they would have pursued with excessive hatred any one who\r\nshould have pointed out to them their true station in relation to their\r\nfellow-creatures. They were in no danger of hearing such disagreeable\r\ntruths from Guinigi: he was content not to be deceived himself by the\r\nfalse shadows thrown from society; but with that amenity which was his\r\ncharacteristic, he adapted his counsels to the ideas of others, and\r\nallowed those whom he could not hope to new mould, to sleep in their\r\npleasant dreams.\r\n\r\nCastruccio was presented to the doge, and partook of all the brilliant\r\namusements of Venice. But at length the time arrived, when he was to\r\ndepart with sir Ethelbert Atawel, and Guinigi to return to his farm\r\namong the hills. It was a sorrowful event for Atawel and Castruccio to\r\nseparate from this kind and valued friend. Before he departed, Guinigi\r\ntalked long with Castruccio, and vehemently urged him, when he should\r\narrive in England, that he would put himself entirely under the guidance\r\nof Atawel. \"You will be,\" he said, \"in a strange country, with unknown\r\nmanners and customs; so that without a guide you would find it difficult\r\nto steer a right course among them. My dear Castruccio, God only knows\r\nwhat your future fortunes will be; but your father intrusted you to my\r\ncare, and I feel the most earnest anxiety that you should enter life\r\nunder good auspices, and enjoy, at least with untarnished pleasure, the\r\nyears of youthful hope. Be towards Atawel as you ever have been to me;\r\nthe natural ingenuousness of your character will discover to you the\r\nmedium, which combines the graceful submission of youth, with that\r\nindependence that is the dearest birthright of man. Atawel is gentle and\r\nunassuming; you must seek his counsels; for his best wisdom will be\r\nbestowed upon you, when you shew a desire to consult it.\"\r\n\r\nThey separated: Atawel and Castruccio departed with a few attendants\r\ntowards Milan on their road to England.\r\n\r\nCastruccio now found himself with a companion, different from him to\r\nwhom he had just bade an affectionate farewell. Atawel was more a man of\r\nthe world than Guinigi; nor did he possess his genius and surpassing\r\nexcellence. Entering into the common road of life, he was\r\nnotwithstanding able to regulate his conduct by just principles, and to\r\nrecommend himself by a sound judgement and a steady courage; but he was\r\nunable to strike into new paths, and become an adventurer in life and\r\nmorals as Guinigi had been. He had great sensibility and warm\r\naffections; and various misfortunes in life had turned a constitutional\r\ngravity into melancholy. Yet he unveiled his spirit for a while from the\r\nclouds that obscured it, and entered with interest into the views and\r\nexpectations of Castruccio.\r\n\r\nThey conversed together concerning his cousin Alderigo, who was a rich\r\nmerchant in London, and who by his respectability and talents had\r\nacquired influence even among the nobles of England. Alderigo had been\r\nknown and loved by Edward I: for in those days kings did not disdain to\r\nseek friends among those classes of society from which ordinary\r\netiquette would have excluded them. The merchant however had withdrawn\r\nfrom all communication with the court, since the accession of Edward of\r\nCaernarvon; for the childish amusements of this monarch ill accorded\r\nwith the dispositions of one who had been the friend of his manly\r\nfather. When the barons of England remonstrated with Edward, and\r\ninsisted on the exile of Piers Gavaston, Alderigo had however come\r\nforward to persuade the king to this necessary concession.\r\n\r\nAtawel also was an enemy of Gavaston; and, as he sketched the political\r\nstate of England to his young companion, he painted with indignation the\r\nchange from the spirited counsels of the late sovereign, to the puerile\r\namusements and weak inaction of his son. He described Gavaston as a man\r\nexpert in feats of bodily activity, but destitute of judgement and manly\r\nenterprise. He said that he was vain-glorious, rapacious, and profuse.\r\nInsolent to his superiors and equals, tyrannical to his inferiors, he\r\ndeigned to use the arts of courtesy to the king alone: even the queen\r\nfailed in obtaining from him the respect due to her sex and dignity. He\r\nhad been raised to rank and wealth by the royal favour; but he conducted\r\nhimself with an arrogance, that would not have been tolerated in the\r\nfirst noble of the land. He was not content to overcome his adversary in\r\nthe field of honour; but he endeavoured to add to his shame by sarcasm\r\nand ridicule. The barons exerted their utmost power for his destruction;\r\nEdward yielded to force; but on the first favourable opportunity he\r\nrecalled his friend, who, untaught by adversity, again irritated his\r\nrivals to that hostility in which he was sure to be worsted.\r\n\r\nThe animated picture which Atawel drew of the discontent and turbulence\r\nof the English barons, although it would have excited terror in these\r\nquiet times, delighted Castruccio, as affording a hope of having now\r\nfound a fitting stage on which he might commence his active career. The\r\nloss of Scotland to England, and the inaction of the king and his\r\nfavourite, easily induced him to sympathize in the indignation of\r\nAtawel; and he readily believed, that the insolence of the upstart and\r\nunworthy Gavaston demanded and justified the most rigorous measures to\r\nensure his expulsion from the kingdom.\r\n\r\nCastruccio was now eighteen years of age. His converse with Guinigi had\r\nindued him with a manliness of thought and a firmness of judgement\r\nbeyond his years; at the same time that the vivacity of his temper often\r\nmade him appear rash, and the gaiety of his disposition led him to seek\r\nwith ardour the common diversions of his age. He was bred as a young\r\nesquire in all those accomplishments which were deemed essential to a\r\ngentleman, and was expert in feats of horsemanship and arms, in the\r\ndance, and in other exercises peculiar to his country. His countenance,\r\nwhich was uncommonly beautiful, expressed frankness, benevolence and\r\nconfidence; when animated, his eyes shone with fire; when silent, there\r\nwas a deep seriousness in his expression, that commanded attention,\r\ncombined at the same time with a modesty and grace which prepossessed\r\nevery one in his favour. His slight, but active form never moved without\r\ndisplaying some new elegance of person; and his voice, whose modulated\r\naccents stole on the ear like sweetest music, forced the hearer to love\r\nhim; his laugh, like that of a child, heartfelt and joyous, was entirely\r\ndistinct from the sneer of contempt, or the arrogance of superiority. He\r\nhad read little; but he had conversed with those who had studied deeply,\r\nso that his conversation and manners were imbued with that refinement\r\nand superior sweetness, which are peculiar to those who unite the\r\ncultivation of the mind to exterior accomplishments. Gay, ambitious and\r\nbeloved, there was little pride, and no insolence in his nature: nor\r\ncould he endure either to be the object of arrogance, or to perceive it\r\nexercised over others.\r\n\r\nSuch was Castruccio, when in the beginning of the year 1309 he landed on\r\nthe English shores. Gavaston had just been expelled by a confederacy of\r\nthe nobles, who for a while had assumed the royal power into their own\r\nhands. But, instead of having been poorly exiled according to the wish\r\nof the barons, his royal master had invested him with the Lieutenancy of\r\nIreland, where he signalized himself by his victories over the rebels.\r\nEdward however could not be happy in the absence of his favourite, but,\r\nmelancholy and irresolute, watched for a fitting opportunity, when the\r\nhatred of his nobles should in some degree be softened, to recall him.\r\n\r\nAlderigo received his young cousin with the warmest affection, and\r\nshewed every disposition to aid by his wealth and influence, in placing\r\nhim in such a situation as might gratify his ambition. Atawel introduced\r\nhim at court; and, if the haughty barons of England viewed with a\r\nsupercilious smile the youthful beauty and accomplishments of the\r\nstranger, Edward was pleased to behold one, who by his foreign air, and\r\nthe refinement of his manners, recalled the memory of his exiled\r\nfavourite. He distinguished Castruccio among the crowd; and the youth,\r\ndazzled perhaps by royal favour, easily altered his prepossessions in\r\nfavour of the barons, into love and pity for their oppressed sovereign.\r\nAt balls and tournaments Castruccio shone among the throng. He was yet\r\ntoo youthful to enter into manual contests with the English lords; but\r\nthe management of his horse, his graceful person, his skill in the\r\ndance, and other light games endeared him to Edward, who was incapable\r\nof sympathizing in the ruder exercises in which his barons were so\r\njealous of their pre-eminence.\r\n\r\nAtawel and Alderigo viewed the favour which Castruccio enjoyed with the\r\nking, with fearful eyes: they dreaded the jealousy of the nobles; but\r\nhappily this passion was not excited on the present occasion. On the\r\ncontrary they were rather pleased, that the king should be amused by the\r\ncompany of one, whose youth and precarious situation withheld him from\r\nentering into the lists of rivalry with them. The Italian Castruccio,\r\ndependent on the bounty of a merchant of his own country, no conqueror\r\nat the tournament, neither thwarting, nor understanding their several\r\nplans of aggrandisement, was past over with a scornful smile, which the\r\nyouth, regarding himself as a sufferer in common with their injured\r\nking, did not receive as a degradation. But deeper feelings of sympathy\r\nnow gave him other sentiments.\r\n\r\nEdward's favourite recreation was the game of tennis; in which, it being\r\ncommon in Italy under the name of _la Palla_, Castruccio excelled. One\r\nday after having amused themselves at this exercise in one of the royal\r\ngardens, Edward feeling fatigued gave up the game, and leaning on\r\nCastruccio's arm, strolled with him down one of the shady allies. And\r\nhere for the first time he opened his heart to his new friend: he\r\ndescribed Gavaston as the most amiable and the most accomplished knight\r\nof the times: he dwelt with touching earnestness on his own attachment\r\nto him, and his forced separation; tears started into his eyes as he\r\nspoke of the desolate state of his heart, deprived of the company of his\r\nfirst, his only and his dearest friend; and his cheeks glowed with\r\nindignation, as he mentioned the arrogance of his nobles, and the state\r\nof slavery to which he was reduced.\r\n\r\nCastruccio was deeply moved; and the natural feeling of pity, with which\r\nhe was inspired at the spectacle of the slavery of one, who it was\r\npresumed had a divine right to command, was augmented by the idea that\r\nhe had been found a worthy deposit for the overflowings of the royal\r\nsorrows. He offered his services with earnestness, and Edward gladly\r\naccepted his proffers. \"Yes, my dear friend,\" he cried, \"the\r\naccomplishment of my fondest wishes shall devolve upon you. You shall be\r\nmy saviour; the saviour of my honour, and the cause of the only\r\nhappiness I can enjoy on earth, the return of my beloved Piers.\"\r\n\r\nEdward then disclosed to Castruccio the various expedients he had used,\r\nto pacify his nobles, and to obtain the re-establishment of his friend.\r\nHe acknowledged that he had just received from the Pope a dispensation\r\nof Gavaston's oath never again to set foot in England; and a faithful\r\nmessenger was only necessary, to carry this intelligence to his friend,\r\nand bid him instantly return; so that the barons, taken unawares, should\r\nnot have time to plot new disturbances, before the king should be able\r\nto defy their worst, secure of the life and the society of his\r\nfavourite. \"That task shall devolve on you, my dear Castruccio,\" said\r\nhe; \"and I shall be indebted to you for the happiness of again embracing\r\nhim to whom I have bound myself by the ties of an eternal friendship.\r\nFrame a plausible excuse for quitting England, and hasten to Dublin,\r\nwhere Piers impatiently waits a messenger from me; that you may not be\r\nexposed to the slightest risk from the suspicion of the nobles, I will\r\ngive you no letter: but this ring, as was agreed upon between myself and\r\nmy friend, will obtain for its bearer his full confidence and\r\nfriendship.\"\r\n\r\nCastruccio took leave of the monarch, and hastened to the house of\r\nAlderigo, full of pride, hope, and joy. He had now indeed entered upon\r\nlife, and as he hoped, with the best auspices: he had become the chosen\r\nconfident of a king, and his secret messenger; he readily believed that\r\nprudence, and prudence should not fail him, would cause his rise to the\r\nhighest dignities. His feelings were not entirely selfish; for he deeply\r\npitied Edward, and was sincerely happy in serving him: but to pity and\r\nserve a king, was a state of being full of pleasure. In accordance with\r\nthe prudent plan he had marked out for himself, he remained at the house\r\nof his kinsman during several days, secluded from his courtly friends,\r\nand absenting himself entirely from the palace. On occasion of the\r\narrival of a few letters from France, he informed Atawel and Alderigo,\r\nthat it was absolutely necessary for him to undertake a journey to that\r\ncountry. As he alleged the most frivolous causes as the motive of this\r\ndetermination, his friends easily perceived that he was endeavouring to\r\nmislead them by a false pretext. The Italian, after having in vain\r\nendeavoured to win his confidence, contented himself with recommending\r\nprudence and caution: Atawel spoke more seriously, and bade the youth\r\nbeware, before he mixed with the intrigues of a foreign court, in which\r\nif he were once detected, he had neither friends nor connections to\r\nextricate him from the rage of his powerful adversaries. And then again\r\nhe intreated Castruccio to consider the justice of the cause in the\r\nservice of which he enlisted himself, and what would be the probable\r\nconsequences, if through his means Edward were to establish a\r\ncorrespondence with his favourite. The young man listened with seeming\r\ndeference, but allowed no word to escape him, that might countenance the\r\nidea that his journey was influenced by any except private\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nHe departed from London, as if on his way to France; then suddenly\r\nchanging his route, he traversed the kingdom, and crossing from Bristol\r\nto Cork, hastened to Dublin, and carried to Gavaston the welcome command\r\nof the king to return immediately to England; the ring that he bore from\r\nEdward, was an immediate passport to the friendship of the illustrious\r\nexile.\r\n\r\nPiers Gavaston was still in the flower of his age. If he were not\r\nhandsome, yet the expression of his features was manly and interesting;\r\nhe was graceful in person, and strong of muscle, though agile of limb:\r\nhe was courteous in general society, though a certain haughtiness was\r\ndiffused over his whole manner, which forbade any more familiar feeling\r\nthan that of admiration. Among his friends this air of superiority\r\nyielded to the most winning kindness and affability of demeanour, which,\r\nbeing ever a mark of distinguished affection, did not fail to bind them\r\nto him by an additional tie of gratitude. He spoke several languages\r\nwith great fluency; he rivalled the most graceful knights of France, and\r\nfar surpassed the English in all chivalrous accomplishments. The\r\nconsciousness of power with which his dexterity inspired him, generated\r\nan independence and frankness of action, which would have rendered him\r\namiable to all, had it not been tainted by vanity and presumption. He\r\nwas magnificent in his attire, fond of parade, and proud of his dazzling\r\nfortunes, all heavy sins among his English enemies. He paid great\r\nattention, and made much shew of love to Castruccio, whom if princely\r\naffability had before moved, the gracious treatment of Gavaston made a\r\ncomplete conquest of him.\r\n\r\nThey returned together to England. Edward had arrived at Chester, that\r\nhe might behold his friend a few days the sooner; and he flew to his\r\narms with the affectionate transports with which a child might welcome\r\nthe return of its absent mother.\r\n\r\nA strict friendship was established between Gavaston and Castruccio.\r\nPiers had not learned moderation from adversity; his wealth and luxury\r\nwere increased, and with these his vanity and insufferable presumption.\r\nAtawel in vain endeavoured to win Castruccio from his society; but, if\r\nthe deportment of Gavaston was arrogant towards the English lords, it\r\nwas so much the more affable and insinuating towards Castruccio. The\r\nking also loved the Italian; and, not examining the merits of the case,\r\nhe allowed himself to be entirely led away by the personal attachment\r\nthat he bore to Edward and Piers.\r\n\r\nGavaston had wealth and rank; and, although he was considered an\r\nupstart, yet the possession of these gave him a consequence in the eyes\r\nof the nobles, of which Castruccio was wholly divested. They looked on\r\nthe latter as one may regard a stinging insect, whose insignificance is\r\nnot to compound for his annoyance. They endured the insolence of\r\nGavaston with the sullenness of men who look into the future for\r\nrevenge; but they bore the far slighter pain which Castruccio inflicted\r\nupon them, with the impatience one feels at an injury, however slight,\r\nfor which we are by no means prepared. And, if Castruccio himself\r\nmanifested few symptoms of insolence, yet he was supported by that of\r\nGavaston; and they felt that, though for the present they could not\r\ninjure the favourite personally, yet they might wound him through his\r\nItalian friend. This latter also was not unfrequently provoked beyond\r\nhis usual courtesy by the pride and taunts of his enemies; and, if ever\r\nhe dared reply, or when Gavaston replied for him, the nobles felt a rage\r\nthey could ill smother at what they deemed so despicable an offender.\r\nThe indications of mischief which had before slightly manifested\r\nthemselves, broke out one day with a violence that suddenly terminated\r\nCastruccio's visit to England.\r\n\r\nHe accompanied the king, who went with a train of the first nobility on\r\na hawking party, to Chelsea. The exercise excited Castruccio's blood,\r\nand inspired him with an exaltation of spirits which might have\r\nexhausted itself in gaiety alone, had not a quarrel, that arose between\r\nhim and one of the nobles, urged him to a fury he could ill control. The\r\ncontention began concerning the comparative flight of their birds; and,\r\nhealed as they were by personal animosity, it became loud and bitter.\r\nEdward in vain endeavoured to appease them; but when, seconded by his\r\nfriends, the English nobleman established his triumph in the contest,\r\nCastruccio replied by a sarcasm which so irritated his antagonist, that\r\nno longer restraining his indignation, he darted forward, and struck\r\nCastruccio. The fiery youth, crying in Italian, \"By blood, and not by\r\nwords, are blows to be avenged!\"--drew his stiletto, and plunged it into\r\nthe bosom of his adversary. A hundred swords immediately flashed in the\r\nair; Edward threw himself before his friend to protect him: Gavaston,\r\nAtawel and others who loved him, hastily withdrew him from the crowd,\r\nmade him mount his horse, and without a moment's delay they rode to the\r\nriver's side below the Tower, where they fortunately found a vessel on\r\nthe point of sailing for Holland. Without waiting to see his other\r\nfriends, without going to the house of Alderigo for money or equipment,\r\nthey hurried him on board the vessel, which immediately got under weigh,\r\nand dropt down with a favourable wind towards the Nore.\r\n\r\nThe barons, burning with revenge, had sent archers to the house of\r\nAlderigo, who, not finding Castruccio, seized upon his kinsman, and\r\nthrew him into prison. A law then existed in England, that if a\r\nforeigner killed a native and escaped, those with whom he resided became\r\namenable for the murder. Alderigo was therefore in the most imminent\r\nperil; but Edward, as the last act of friendship that he could bestow\r\nupon Castruccio, saved the life and fortune of his kinsman. And thus,\r\nafter a year's residence in this island, did the youth bring to a\r\ndisastrous conclusion all the hopes and expectations which had led him\r\nthither.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\n_Castruccio in Flanders and France--Alberto\r\nScoto--Benedetto Pepi._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a favourable navigation of a few hours Castruccio arrived at\r\nOstend. He landed destitute of friends, and even of the equipage of a\r\ngentleman. What Castruccio felt during the voyage can hardly be\r\ndescribed. Anger, grief and shame kept his spirits in a perpetual\r\nfluctuation, which, painful as it was, was far preferable to the\r\nextinction of hope, and the sense of utter desertion upon his landing in\r\nFlanders. The world was indeed before him: he had been torn with\r\nfrightful suddenness from the affections he had cultivated for a year,\r\nfrom ease, luxury and the friendship of a powerful monarch, and\r\nconsigned to utter destitution. He did not even possess the lance and\r\nhorse, with which knights-errant of old won kingdoms for themselves. Nor\r\ndid he think without remorse of the blood with which his hands were for\r\nthe first time stained; he had received a blow, and blood alone could\r\nexpiate this injury: in France or England a duel in regular and courtly\r\nform would have terminated the quarrel; but in Italy the secret stiletto\r\nwas the weapon of revenge, and the murder of one was avenged by the\r\nassassination of another, until the list of expiatory murders ran high,\r\nand were carefully counted by each party, each justifying his own, and\r\nblaming those of his adversary. Yet, although the mind of Castruccio was\r\ntinctured by the morality of his country, he was too young and too new\r\nnot to feel a natural horror at having been the cause of the death of a\r\nfellow creature. Seated on a rock amidst the wide sands left by the\r\nretiring sea, listening to the melancholy roar of the tide, he shed\r\nbitter tears of repentance and conscious guilt. One idea alone calmed\r\nhim, that his adversary might not have died--and then what was he? His\r\nrashness and folly had thrown him from a high station of prosperity and\r\nhappiness, to being the solitary, helpless creature that he then was.\r\n\r\nThe sun sunk in a turbid sky. \"Ah! how unlike dear Italy,\" sighed\r\nCastruccio; \"how different from the clear heavens and orange-tinted\r\nsunsets of my native soil!\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke in Italian, and a man who stood near unperceived by him,\r\nrepeated the word so dear to exiles, the name of the country of his\r\nbirth:--\"_Italia_.\" Castruccio looked up, and the man continued: \"Italy\r\nis also my native country. And who are you, my friend, who, alone and a\r\nstranger, mourn for the delights of that paradise of the earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a Lucchese,\" replied Castruccio; \"I am the cousin of Alderigo, the\r\nrich merchant in England.\"\r\n\r\n\"The name of an Italian,\" said the other, \"is a sufficient passport to\r\nmy poor hospitality; but, as the relation of my excellent friend, Messer\r\nAlderigo, it greatly delights me to offer you all the little service\r\nthat I am capable of giving. Come with me to my house; you will recall\r\nperhaps some not unpleasing associations in the society of an Italian\r\nfamily, who, during a long absence, have never forgotten the olive\r\ngroves of Italy, and never ceased to desire to return to them.\"\r\n\r\nCastruccio accepted this friendly invitation with joy. He found his host\r\na rich merchant of Ostend, living in the Italian style, and surrounded\r\nby a family, whose language and persons transported him to the plains of\r\nLombardy, or the vallies of his native Tuscany.\r\n\r\nDuring the conversation of the evening his host mentioned the wars that\r\nwere then carrying on between the French king and the Flemings, and that\r\nAlberto Scoto commanded under the banners of the former with a troop of\r\nItalians. This account struck Castruccio with a hope, that he should now\r\nfind some remedy for his misfortunes. Being obliged to enter on a new\r\ncareer, and his inclination leading him to war, he thought that this\r\nopportunity of serving under a fellow-countryman was too favourable a\r\ncircumstance to be neglected. He made many enquiries concerning this\r\ntroop and its illustrious chief. Alberto Scoto had once possessed a wide\r\ndominion in Lombardy; he had expelled the Visconti from Milan, and had\r\nbeen constituted tyrant or lord of the most flourishing Lombard states.\r\nWhen by the joint force of revolt and treason he was driven from his\r\npower, he had not lost his reputation as a successful general, and\r\nPhilip le Bel, king of France, eagerly accepted his offered services. In\r\nformer times he had been considered as belonging to the Guelph faction;\r\nbut he had changed before he quitted Italy; and, now an exile, the\r\ndistinction of party was entirely lost to him.\r\n\r\nCastruccio had never yet made a campaign; and his eager spirit led him\r\nto regard with disdain the sloth in which he had hitherto passed his\r\nlife. From the moment that he had landed in France he had resolved to\r\ncommence a military career; and he believed that he should find no\r\nbetter school than that of Alberto Scoto, where he would be disciplined\r\nin the modes of his own country, and learn under so experienced a\r\ngeneral, the tactics of those armies which he hoped one day to command.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning he discoursed concerning these ideas with his\r\nhost, who easily entered into his designs, and promised to provide him\r\nwith such an introduction to Scoto as would at least command his\r\nattention. His plans were quickly arranged.\r\n\r\nThe merchant took a kind leave of his young compatriot, and gave him a\r\nwell filled purse at parting: \"You shall repay me,\" said he smiling,\r\n\"out of your first spoils: or, if these fall short of my expectations,\r\nMesser Alderigo will not suffer a friend of his to lose through his\r\nkindness to a kinsman.\"\r\n\r\nCastruccio traversed in safety the plains of Flanders, and arrived at\r\nthe French camp, which was pitched near Douai. He penetrated with some\r\ndifficulty into the tent of Scoto: but that experienced general soon\r\nperceived in the mien of the youthful stranger a soldier's deportment\r\nand air of independence, that prepossessed him at once in his favour.\r\nAfter having read the letter of Castruccio's host, he addressed the\r\nyouth with kindness. \"Our countryman,\" said he, \"informs me that you are\r\nthe chief of the noble family of the Antelminelli, a name so well known\r\nin Italy, as to be itself a sufficient introduction to a native of that\r\ncountry. You desire to serve under me, and I feel myself honoured by\r\nyour selection; my troop must be a gainer by the acquisition of so noble\r\na volunteer.\"\r\n\r\nThe manners of Scoto were courtly; and in his conversation with the\r\nyouth his keen judgement quickly discovered the qualifications of\r\nCastruccio. They dined together; and afterwards, having equipped him in\r\na becoming dress, he presented him to the French king, from whom he\r\nexperienced a favourable reception. Castruccio did not fail speedily to\r\ninform Alderigo of his situation, who immediately remitted him a sum of\r\nmoney amply sufficient for his present supply.\r\n\r\nCastruccio had now exchanged the idle gaieties of the English court for\r\nthe active labours of a camp; and on the following day he entered on his\r\nmilitary duties. Scoto presented him with a suit of armour, selecting\r\none of the most costly that he possessed. There was a small iron scull\r\ncap which fitted the head, and was worn under the helmet. The casque\r\nitself was of highly polished iron inlaid with gold in beautiful\r\ndevices, and the mailed collar for his neck was plated with the same\r\nprecious metal. The breast-plate was finely carved, and fastened over\r\nthe shoulders to the back plate, which was laboured with less delicacy.\r\nThe greaves which sheathed his legs, were beautifully inlaid, and shone\r\nwith gold; his sword was of the finest temper, and the scabbard, richly\r\nadorned, hung at his side from an embroidered scarf; a shield and a good\r\nlance completed his equipment. Arms of less costly manufacture were\r\nchosen for his horse, which, selected from the stud of Scoto, was\r\nstrong, heavy and spirited.\r\n\r\nThe next day the camp was in motion. It were needless to detail the\r\nevents of this campaign: several battles were fought, and some towns\r\ntaken. The French who had hitherto been losers, regained their ground;\r\nand in every action the troop of Scoto distinguished itself, and among\r\nhis troop Castruccio was pre-eminent in bravery, enterprise and success.\r\nScoto perceived, and warmly applauded his courage and conduct: the fame\r\nof his actions was spread through the army, and his first campaign\r\ncrowned him with that reputation to which he had long aspired. King\r\nPhilip himself had witnessed his achievements; he beheld him as he led a\r\ntroop to the onset, and turned in favour of France the dubious fortune\r\nof a hard-fought day. The King proved his gratitude by bestowing on him\r\nsuch praises and rewards as filled Castruccio with triumph and delight.\r\n\r\nScoto was quartered during the winter at one of the Flemish towns, and\r\nCastruccio was invited to partake of the gaieties of the Parisian court.\r\nHe obeyed the summons, and spent some weeks in the enjoyment of all\r\nthose amusements which the palace of Philip afforded. His beauty and\r\ngrace attracted the notice of the ladies; and his fame in arms caused\r\nhim to be distinguished by the French nobility.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the winter he returned to the camp of Scoto, in\r\nwhose esteem he held a very high place. This general delighted in\r\nimparting his experience to so attentive a listener, and in endeavouring\r\nto form the genius of one who he foresaw would rise to the highest rank\r\namong the lords of Italy. Castruccio was admitted at all hours to his\r\ntent; they rode together; and, under the precepts of one well\r\nexperienced in the politics of Italy, Castruccio began to understand and\r\nmeditate the part he should act, when he returned to that country. Yet\r\nScoto's was an evil school; and, if his pupil gained from him a true\r\ninsight into Italian politics, he at the same time learned the use of\r\nthose arts which then so much disgraced that people. The _Punica fides_\r\nhad been transferred across the Mediterranean; and every kind of wile\r\nand artifice was practised in the Italian palaces, which ever received\r\nfrom the court of the Popes, as from a well of poison, courtiers and\r\ncrafty politicians, who never permitted the art to fail for want of\r\ninstructors. Scoto had been more successful than any other in the\r\nexercise of this policy, and he now initiated Castruccio in the secrets\r\nof the craft. Hitherto his mind had been innocence, and all his thoughts\r\nwere honour. Frankness played on his lips; ingenuousness nestled in his\r\nheart; shame was ever ready to check him on the brink of folly; and the\r\ntenderness of his nature seemed to render it impossible for him to\r\nperpetrate a deed of harshness or inhumanity. The court of England had\r\ninfused some laxity into his moral creed; but at least he had not\r\nlearned there hypocrisy, and the wily arts of a hoary politician. Still\r\nthe strait path of honour and a single mind had ever engaged his choice.\r\nBut nineteen is a dangerous age; and ill betides the youth who confides\r\nhimself to a crafty instructor. If Castruccio listened at first with an\r\ninattentive ear to the counsels of Scoto, yet their frequent repetition,\r\nand the wax-like docility of his mind, quickly gave them power over him.\r\n\r\n\"You, my dear Castruccio,\" said Scoto, \"will soon return to your native\r\ncountry, where your talents and valour will open for you a brilliant\r\ncareer. A soldier, if he join wisdom of counsel to soldiership, must for\r\na while succeed in Italy; and if he be prudent, he need not fall as I\r\ndid. A chief in Italy ought to pay strict attention to the discipline\r\nand equipment of his followers, and to the spreading the terror of his\r\nname among his enemies. This must be his first step; and without that\r\nthe foundations of his power are as sand; for to have many cities\r\nsubject to his command is as nothing in the hour of danger, since if he\r\ncontrol them not with iron, gold will ever find its way into the\r\ncouncils of the citizens; and woe and defeat are to that chief, who\r\nreigns only by the choice of the people; a choice more fickle and\r\ndeceitful than the famed faithlessness of woman.\r\n\r\n\"But, having once formed an army, disciplined it, and shewn its temper\r\nby success, then is the time to change the arts of war for those of\r\ncounsel, and to work your way as the mole, shewing no sign of your path,\r\nuntil your triumphant power comes forth where it is least expected. Nor\r\nbe lavish of gold; for that is power while you possess it, weakness when\r\nsurrendered into the hands of another. But alliances, marriages, nominal\r\nhonours and promises are the fit allurements to be used among our\r\ncountrymen. By one or other of these means, of such motley materials are\r\nItalian confederacies composed, one single chieftain may ever introduce\r\ndissention and treason into the enemy's camp. It was thus that I fell;\r\nfor I did not trust to my own strength, but to that of my allies.\r\n\r\n\"There are two classes of men in Italy, which indeed often cut like a\r\ntwo-edged sword, and turn upon their master, yet which with proper\r\nmanagement are of infinite use in the accomplishment of secret treaties,\r\nand the carrying on of correspondence in the very heart of the enemy's\r\ncouncils: these are the priests, and the _Uomini di Corte_[2]. The\r\npriests are the least trust-worthy and the most expensive: yet sometimes\r\nI have seen them stand by their employer, if he yielded them much\r\nrespect and apparent submission, and betray him who has paid them well,\r\nyet who had neglected the arts of flattery. In their youth men are often\r\nled to trust to their actions and their sword; but every day is another\r\npage of experience, to shew us that men are governed by words alone,\r\nwords light as air, yet which have often been found capable of\r\noverturning empires: witness the triumphs of the Popes, who dissipated\r\nthe armies of their enemies, and despoiled them of rank, possessions and\r\nlife, by excommunications, and anathemas--words. But, in discovering\r\nthis infinite power in words, let it make you prudent in their use; be\r\nnot chary in their quantity, but look well to their quality. But to\r\nreturn to our instruments,--priests, and _Uomini di Corte_.\r\n\r\n\"These latter are poor dogs, often faithful, easily satisfied, and who\r\ncan penetrate every where, see every thing, hear every thing, and if you\r\nacquire but the art of getting their knowledge from them, they become of\r\ninfinite utility; this is done by many words, much good humour, and a\r\nlittle gold. When Della Torre and I chased Matteo Visconti from Milan,\r\nthat chief retired to live on bread and onions in his miserable castle\r\nof St. Columban among the Euganean hills. All at once Della Torre began\r\nto suspect, that Matteo had received money from Germany, and was\r\nsecretly collecting arms and men at his castle. So he sent for a _Uomo\r\ndi Corte_, a famous fellow in those days, one Marco Lombardi, who had in\r\nformer times prophesied to count Ugolino his future misfortunes, and\r\nsaid to him; 'Now, my brave Marco, if you would gain a palfrey and a\r\ngold-embroidered robe, I have an easy task, which accomplished they\r\nshall both be yours. Go, as if on your own pleasure, to the castle where\r\nMatteo Visconti now lives; spy well if there be gleam of arms or\r\nappearance of soldiers; and, when you take leave of the chief, ask him\r\nin a buffoonish manner to answer you two questions: let those questions\r\nbe, first, how he likes his present state, and if he be not poorly off;\r\nand secondly, when he hopes to return to Milan.'\r\n\r\n\"Marco readily undertook the task, and visited the castle of St.\r\nColumban, where he found Visconti ill dressed, ill fed, and worse\r\nattended; for there were about him only a few wrinkled and crippled\r\nfollowers, who not being able to gain more in the wars, and too lazy for\r\nwork, came to starve themselves under his roof. His good lady was worse\r\noff, not having a handmaid to wait upon her, and, as I have heard, there\r\nwas but one capuchin between her and her husband, which they wore by\r\nturns. Marco made but a short stay in the castle, for he got nothing to\r\neat; but, as he took his leave of Visconti, he intreated the chief to\r\nhelp him to gain a palfrey and a silken robe. 'Willingly,' replied\r\nVisconti, 'if I am able; but think not to get them from me, for I have\r\nthem not.'\r\n\r\n\"'Noble count,' said Marco, 'answer me two questions, and I shall\r\nreceive these gifts in pay for your answers.'\r\n\r\n\"And then he put the two demands, as Della Torre had instructed him.\r\nVisconti, who was discerning and cunning, replied: 'Truly I find my\r\npresent situation suited to me, since I suit myself to it; tell this to\r\nyour master, Messer Guido Della Torre, who sent you; and tell him also,\r\nthat when his crimes out number mine, then it is God's will that I\r\nreturn to Milan.'\r\n\r\n\"Della Torre, relieved from his fears, since he undoubtedly feared\r\nGerman gold more than the due punishment for his sins, rewarded Marco as\r\nhe had promised.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the lessons of Scoto; and the reader will easily forgive me,\r\nif I repeat them not so often, or dilate on them so much as the chief\r\nhimself did. Castruccio listened with curiosity, half angry, half\r\nconvinced; and in those days the seeds of craft were sown, that,\r\nflourishing afterwards, contributed to his advancement to power and\r\nglory. As winter drew to a close, Scoto said to him: \"I could have\r\nwished, my young friend, that you fought under my banners another\r\ncampaign, and that I might still enjoy the advantage of your society and\r\nvalour; but fortune orders it otherwise, and you must away to Italy.\r\nHenry of Luxemburgh, now emperor of Germany, has begun to advance\r\ntowards that country, where he will collect the wrecks of the Ghibeline\r\nparty, and endeavour to re-establish them. You are a Ghibeline of a high\r\nand faithful family, and must not omit this opportunity for your\r\nadvancement. Return to Italy; join the emperor; and I doubt not that\r\nthrough his means you will be restored to your wealth and rights in\r\nLucca. Go, Castruccio; you are formed for action and command: do not\r\nforget my lessons. Here or in England they might be useless, but in\r\nItaly they are necessary to your success. I doubt not of the high\r\nfortune that awaits you; and it will warm my old blood, if I think, that\r\nI, an exile, and a soldier of fortune, fighting under colours not my\r\nown, shall have contributed to the advancement of so lofty a spirit as\r\nyours.\"\r\n\r\nCastruccio followed the advice of Scoto; he took an affectionate leave\r\nof him, and again received the courteous thanks of the French monarch.\r\nHe was loaded with many costly presents; and his sword, of the finest\r\ntemper, the hilt and sheath richly embossed and inlaid with jewels, was\r\npresented to him by the hands of the queen. He consigned these gifts,\r\nand the spoil by which he was enriched, into the hands of an Italian\r\nmerchant, to be conveyed by his means into Italy; he travelled himself\r\non horseback, accompanied by a servant, and a mule which bore his\r\narmour.\r\n\r\nJourneying at this leisurely rate, he arrived after an interval of some\r\nweeks, at the south-eastern extremity of France. He approached the\r\nbeautiful Alps, the boundaries of his native country: their white domes\r\nand peaks pierced the serene atmosphere; and silence, the deep silence\r\nof an Alpine winter, reigned among their ravines. As he advanced into\r\ntheir solitudes, he lost all traces of the footsteps of man, and almost\r\nof animals:--an eagle would sometimes cross a ravine, or a chamois was\r\nseen hanging on the nearly perpendicular rock. The giant pines were\r\nweighed down by a huge canopy of snow; and the silent torrents and\r\nfrozen waterfalls were covered, and almost hid, by the uniform mass. The\r\npaths of the vallies, and the ascent of the mountains, ever difficult,\r\nwere almost impassable; perpetual showers of snow hid every track, and a\r\nfew straggling poles alone guided the traveller in his dangerous\r\njourney. The vulture leaving his nest in the rock, screamed above,\r\nseeming to tell the rash adventurer who dared disturb his haunts, that\r\nhis torn limbs were the tribute due to him, the monarch of that region.\r\nSometimes even, the road was strewed with the members of the venturous\r\nchamois, whose sure foot had failed among the snows; and the approach of\r\nCastruccio scared the birds of prey from their repast on his half-frozen\r\nlimbs. One pass was particularly dangerous: the road was cut in the side\r\nof a precipitous mountain: below, the stream which had cleared its way\r\nin the very depth of the valley, was hidden by the overhanging of the\r\nprecipice: above, the mountain side, almost vulture-baffling, black,\r\nexcept where the snow had found a resting-place in its clefts, towered\r\nso high that the head became dizzy, when the traveller would have gazed\r\non the walled-in heavens. The path was narrow; and being entirely\r\nexposed to the south, the snows that covered it had been slightly\r\nmelted, and again frozen, so that they had become slippery and\r\ndangerous. Castruccio dismounted from his horse; and turning his eyes\r\nfrom the depth below, he led him slowly on, until the widening of the\r\nroad, and the appearance of a few pines diminished the terror of the\r\nsurrounding objects.\r\n\r\nThen, finding the road less dangerous, he remounted, and was proceeding\r\ncautiously along the edge of the precipice, when he heard a voice behind\r\nhim as calling for help. Hastily dismounting, and tying the animal to a\r\njutting point of the rock, he returned to that chasm, which he had just\r\npassed with such tremendous difficulty. There he saw a mule standing\r\nquietly by the road side; but, on the steep face of the precipice a few\r\nfeet below, he perceived a man clinging to the pointed inequalities of\r\nthe mountain, with such energy that his whole force and being seemed to\r\nlive in the grasp, and his voice failed as he again endeavoured to cry\r\nfor help. Castruccio's servant had lingered far behind, so that he was\r\nobliged alone to attempt the fearful task of drawing the sufferer from\r\nhis appalling situation. He unbound his sash, and, tying one end to the\r\ngirth of the mule's saddle, and taking the other in his hand, he threw\r\nit down to the man below. By these means, with infinite difficulty, he\r\nsucceeded in hoisting up the poor wretch, who, white and wrinkled with\r\nfear, stood almost as entranced, when he found himself safe from the\r\nfrightful death he had feared. Castruccio soothed him with a gentle\r\nvoice, and told him that now the worst part of the journey was over, and\r\nthat they were about to descend by an easier path to the plain of Italy;\r\n\"where,\" he said, \"you will find a paradise that will cure all your\r\nevils.\"\r\n\r\nThe man looked at him with a mixture of wonder, and what might have been\r\nconstrued into contempt, had his muscles, made rigid with cold and fear,\r\nyielded to the feeling of his mind. He replied drily, \"I am an Italian.\"\r\nAnd Castruccio smiled to perceive, that these words were considered as a\r\nsufficient refutation to his assertion of the boasted charms of Italy.\r\n\r\nAfter resting until the unfortunate traveller had recovered health and\r\nlife, they proceeded along the mountain, saying little, for the path was\r\ntoo dangerous to admit of conversation. Yet, when Castruccio dared take\r\nhis eyes from the track of his horse's feet, he could not help examining\r\ncuriously the companion fortune had given him. He was a man by whose dry\r\nand wrinkled face you might guess him to be nearly sixty years of age;\r\nand yet, by the agility and more youthful appearance of his person, he\r\ncould not be more than forty. His eyes were small, black and sparkling;\r\nhis nose pointed and turned up; his lips were as a line in his face,\r\nuncurved and unmarked except by three deep wrinkles at each corner: his\r\neyebrows were elevated as in vanity; and yet a flat high forehead\r\ndenoted a good understanding. His figure was tall and lank, yet\r\nmuscular, and was clothed with a mixture of poverty and rank, which it\r\namused Castruccio to observe. He wore gilt spurs as a knight, and,\r\ncarefully folded on his saddle before him, was a rich mantle edged with\r\ndeep gold lace; he was clad in a close, strait dress of threadbare\r\ncloth, with a kind of narrow trowsers made of common undressed sheep\r\nskin, which fastened with many knots and intersections round his legs;\r\nhe had a large capuchin cloak wrapped about him, made of coarse flannel,\r\nsuch as was called _sclavina_, because it was manufactured in Sclavonia,\r\nand was worn at that time by the poorest class of Italians. On his feet\r\nhe wore great coarse boots of undressed sheep skin, that furnished a\r\nsingular contrast to the golden spurs attached to them; his head was\r\ncovered only by a scull-cap of iron mail sewed to cloth, which was\r\ncalled in those times a _majata_.\r\n\r\nThe sun descended as they pursued their journey, when, perceiving a\r\nhouse not far distant, Castruccio's companion drew in his mule, and\r\npointing to it, asked if they should not remain there for the night?\r\n\"Nay,\" replied Castruccio, \"the moon will be up in half an hour, and\r\nbeing but just past its full, we may, I think, proceed safely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not trust to the moon,\" said his companion; \"its shadows are deep\r\nand fearful, and its light not less dangerous; sometimes a beam cast\r\nfrom among trees across the road, will look like a running stream, and\r\nits black shades may conceal the most frightful dangers. I dare not\r\nproceed by moonlight, and am unwilling to part company with you on this\r\ndreadful road. I beg you to consent to pass the night at that house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I readily agree, if that be indeed a house, and not an unroofed\r\nsheep-cot; for I hardly expect to find in these regions a bed softer\r\nthan the rock, or a roof which will shelter me better than the moonlight\r\nsky.\"\r\n\r\nThe cottage was shut up, and its inhabitants asleep; but, called up by\r\nthe shrill voice of the elder traveller, a man rolled himself out from\r\nhis bed of dried leaves and sheep skins, and opened the door. Welcoming\r\nthe travellers, he quickly blew up the decaying ashes of a fire in the\r\nmiddle of the only room of the cottage, and it threw a light on the bare\r\nwalls of this disconsolate apartment; the smoke rose and filled the\r\nupper part of the room, while a small portion only escaped through a\r\nround hole in the roof. A large bed, or rather dormitory of dried leaves\r\nand the stalks of Indian corn, was strewed along one side of the room,\r\non which many both men and women lay, peeping out on the travellers from\r\nunder their sheep skin coverings: there was no furniture, except a rude\r\nbench, and a ruder table; the bare walls were black and falling down,\r\nwhile the sky peeped through many cracks in the roof. The room was so\r\nfilled with the stench of garlick and smoke, that Castruccio, hastily\r\nretreating to the door, asked his companion whether he would not prefer\r\nproceeding on his journey. The latter appeared better accustomed to the\r\nsight and smell of such miserable cabins, and he used his utmost\r\neloquence to persuade Castruccio that the shelter of the cottage was\r\npreferable to the pure and keen air of heaven; but finding the latter\r\nresolute in his determination not to enter, he told him, that having\r\nwarmed for a few minutes his half frozen fingers, and tasted the\r\nwine of the cottage, he would proceed with him down the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe companion of Castruccio had not exaggerated the extreme danger of\r\nthe road by moonlight. The frightened horses often refused to proceed,\r\nor to penetrate the murky depths which the mountain shadows cast around\r\nthem, even blackening the snow. They rode on slowly and cautiously; and\r\nthe following morning found themselves little advanced in the descent.\r\nIt was near noon before they reached Susa, when, having passed the\r\ndangers of the journey, the elder traveller, recovering his voice and\r\nrecollection, rode up to Castruccio, and asked him where he intended to\r\nrest after the toil he had undergone. Castruccio replied, that he hoped\r\nto find an inn in the town, and, if not, he should apply to some\r\nmonastery, where he doubted not he should be provided with food and\r\nshelter for the following day and night.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said his companion, \"I am not a stranger in Susa, and have in\r\nparticular one good old friend, Messer Tadeo della Ventura, well known\r\nto the Florentines and other Italians who pass over this mountain for\r\nthe purposes of merchandize: this worthy man will receive me as an old\r\nfriend and guest; and, as you both generously and bravely saved my life,\r\nI can do no less than offer to introduce you to the soft couches and\r\ngood wines of Messer Tadeo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor will I refuse your offer; for soft couches will be welcome to my\r\naching bones, and good wine a pleasant cordial to my wearied spirits:\r\ntherefore, sir knight, I thank you heartily for your courtesy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Uomini di Corte_, or \"men of court:\" story-tellers,\r\nminstrels, actors, or buffoons, who frequented the feasts and courts\r\nheld by the Italian noblemen, and contributed no small part to the\r\namusement of those times. They are frequently spoken of by Boccaccio.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\n_Castruccio in Italy--Susa--Creed of Benedetto._\r\n\r\n\r\nMesser Tadeo received his old friend with respect and friendship; and,\r\ncourteously welcoming Castruccio, he led them into a large hall, where\r\nthe sight of a repast already set out seemed to diffuse joy over the\r\ncountenances of both travellers. The hall was richly hung with scarlet\r\ncloth, and the tables and seats covered with tapestry; at the upper end\r\nof the room was a chimney and a fire, near which taking his seat, Messer\r\nTadeo invited the new comers to join several other friends of his, who\r\narranged themselves round the table.\r\n\r\nWhen the long ceremony of dinner was finished, and the servants were\r\nbusy in removing the tables, Messer Tadeo proposed to the newly arrived\r\nguests to conduct them to a bed-chamber, where they might repose after\r\nthe fatigues of the journey. They both gladly accepted this offer; and\r\nin a deep and refreshing sleep Castruccio forgot his curiosity\r\nconcerning who or what his companion might be, and the latter recovered\r\nfrom the trembling fear of danger, which had haunted him since his\r\nescape of the preceding day.\r\n\r\nWhen Castruccio arose at about six o'clock in the evening, he joined\r\nMesser Tadeo, who was sitting with the other traveller in the great\r\nhall. The rest of the company had departed; and these two were in\r\nearnest conversation, which they changed when Castruccio entered.\r\n\r\nAfter some time, holding up his finger, and drawing down still longer\r\nthe long wrinkles of his cheeks, the fellow-traveller of Castruccio, in\r\na mysterious manner, pronounced the word which had been given to the\r\nsoldiers of Alberto Scoto, that they might distinguish one another\r\nduring the darkness of night, or the confusion of battle; Castruccio,\r\nhearing this, easily divined that he had a fellow soldier, and a friend\r\nof his chief, in his strange travelling companion; so smiling, he\r\nuttered the countersign, and the other, turning on him, as if the ghost\r\nof one whom he had known many years before had risen before him, hastily\r\nenquired, \"You served then in his troop?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Castruccio, \"I had the honour of serving under the noble\r\nknight, Messer Alberto Scoto; and, in having rendered you a service, I\r\nam still more happy to find that I saved one who has fought under the\r\nsame banners with myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is your name a secret?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am of a noble Lucchese family, now exiled and wandering; my name is\r\nCastruccio Castracani dei Antelminelli.\"\r\n\r\nThe elder traveller suddenly arose, and, embracing Castruccio warmly,\r\nbestowed on him a brotherly kiss, and then turning to Tadeo, said: \"This\r\nmorning I introduced to you a stranger whose merit with me was that of\r\nhaving saved my life at the imminent risk of his own; now I introduce to\r\nyou a gallant soldier, whose name has been spread through France, as\r\nthat of the bravest warrior and the ablest commander that fought in the\r\nLow Countries: the Sieur Castruccio is a name which even the children in\r\nFrance lisp with gratitude, and the Flemings tremble to hear.\"\r\n\r\nMany compliments passed; and then the traveller said: \"This pleasant\r\ndiscovery has made friends of three who were before strangers; nor will\r\nI conceal from you, Messer Castruccio, that my name is Benedetto Pepi, a\r\nCremonese, now returning to my own country, after having gained laurels\r\nand knight-hood under the banners of Messer Scoto. You, my dear\r\ncompanion, say that you are an exile; but great changes are now taking\r\nplace in Italy, and, knowing who you are, we may well admit you to the\r\nconfidential conversation that I and Messer Tadeo were holding when you\r\nentered, concerning all that has passed since the arrival of the emperor\r\nHenry in Italy.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, Benedetto made a slight sign to his friend, which\r\nCastruccio easily guessed to be an admonition to be discreet in his\r\ndisclosures. Tadeo replied to this sign by a nod, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Two Florentine usurers who had come through Milan, dined yesterday at\r\nmy house; they had witnessed the entrance of the emperor into that city.\r\nThe lord of Milan, Guido della Torre, was obliged to discharge his\r\nsoldiers, and unarmed, at the head of an unarmed multitude, went out to\r\nmeet the emperor, who had the Visconti in his train, and all the\r\nGhibelines, the old enemies of the Torre family. These are now\r\nreinstated in their possessions; yet Henry still pretends to\r\nimpartiality, and in his march has restored all the exiles to their\r\nvarious towns, whether they be Guelphs or Ghibelines.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" said Pepi, \"how long he will keep on the mask; few men are\r\nimpartial, an emperor never: to one curious in state affairs it were a\r\nfine occasion, to conjecture what will be the issue and crown of these\r\npretensions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" asked Castruccio, \"should not they be as they appear? Cannot the\r\nemperor be animated by a generous policy, and wish to reconcile all\r\nparties by a just and fair proceeding?\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" cried Pepi with energy; \"an emperor just! a prince\r\nimpartial! Do not thrones rest upon dissentions and quarrels? And must\r\nthere not be weakness in the people to create power in the prince? I\r\nprophesy; and as a discreet man I prophesy seldom, yet I now securely\r\nforetell, that Henry will set all Italy by the ears, to reap the fruits\r\nof their dissentions. He procures the recall of all the exiles--I admire\r\nhis policy, worthy of being studied and understood by all who would\r\nreign. Can Ghibelines and Guelphs live within the walls of the same\r\ntown? No more than one vessel can contain fire and water. No; the cities\r\nof Italy will be filled with brawls, and her rivers run blood, by means\r\nof this conjunction. If he had meant to establish peace in Italy, he\r\nwould have assassinated all of one party, to secure the lives of the\r\nother; but to unite them, is to destroy both, and under the mask of\r\nfriendship to get into his own hands all that each has possessed.\"\r\n\r\nPepi uttered this harangue with an energy and a vivacity that startled\r\nCastruccio; his black eyes sparkled, his brows became elevated, and\r\ndrawing down the perpendicular wrinkles of his cheeks, and contracting\r\nthe horizontal ones of his forehead, he looked round with an air of\r\ntriumph on his companions.\r\n\r\n\"You say true, Messer Benedetto,\" said Tadeo, groaning at the dismal\r\nprognostications of his friend; \"and I greatly fear lest this pretended\r\njustice prove the watchword for war and bloodshed. Yet now all wears the\r\nappearance of peace and brotherhood. The lords of Langusco, Pav\u00eca,\r\nVercelli, Novara and Lodi have resigned their tyrannies and given up the\r\nkeys of their respective towns to Henry, and Imperial Vicars are every\r\nwhere established. Guido della Torre, the proudest and most powerful\r\ntyrant of Lombardy, has submitted; and the court of the emperor at Milan\r\nis crowded by the lords of the towns in the east of Italy, and the\r\nambassadors of the free states of the south.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has Florence submitted?\" asked Castruccio.\r\n\r\n\"No;--that town and its league holds out; Sienna, Lucca and Bologna.\r\nYet, when the emperor marches south, we shall see these proud\r\nrepublicans bow their stiff knees.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" cried Pepi; \"Bologna, Lucca and Sienna may submit; but Florence\r\nnever will; they are stiff-kneed, stiff-necked, and hate the name of\r\nemperor and master more than Pope Urban hated the house of Suabia. These\r\nrepublicans, whom from my soul I detest, have turned out the Ghibelines,\r\nand are now fighting with the nobles, and asserting the superiority of\r\nthe vulgar, till every petty artizan of its meanest lane fancies himself\r\nas great a prince as the emperor Henry himself. Besides, when all else\r\nfails, they will buy him off: these Florentines squander their golden\r\nflorins, and pay thousands to purchase what would be a dear bargain even\r\nas a gift. Their watch-word is that echo of fools, and laughing stock of\r\nthe wise,--Liberty. Surely the father of lies invented that bait, that\r\ntrap, at which the multitude catch, as a mouse at a bit of cheese: well\r\nwould it be for the world, if they found the same end; and, as the\r\nnibbling mouse pulls down the iron on his head, they, as if they had one\r\nneck, were lopped off, as they seized their prize:--but Florence\r\nflourishes!\"\r\n\r\nPepi ended his speech with a deep groan, and continued lost in thought;\r\nwhile Tadeo and Castruccio discussed the chances that might arise from\r\nthe new order of things established in Italy; and Castruccio owned his\r\nintention of joining the train of the emperor, and his hopes of being by\r\nhis means re-instated in his paternal estates. The evening wore away\r\nduring these discussions, and they retired early to rest. The next\r\nmorning Castruccio and Pepi took leave of Tadeo, and departed together\r\non the road to Milan.\r\n\r\nFor some time they rode along silently. Castruccio was overcome by a\r\nvariety of feelings on again visiting Italian earth. Although, being\r\nwinter, the landscape was stript bare, and its vineyards and corn-fields\r\nalike appeared waste, yet Castruccio thought that no country could vie\r\nwith this in beauty, unless it were the plain of Lucca, such as he\r\nremembered it, the last time he beheld it, then a child, standing on the\r\nsummit of his father's palace,--girded by hills, and the many-towered\r\ncity set as its heart in the midst. He longed for a companion to whom he\r\ncould pour out his full heart; for his overflowing feelings had for a\r\ntime swept away the many lessons of Alberto Scoto. He forgot ambition,\r\nand the dreams of princely magnificence which he had cherished for many\r\nmonths. He forgot Milan, the emperor, the Guelphs and Ghibelines, and\r\nseemed to bury himself, as a bee in the fragrant circle of a rose, in\r\nthe softest and most humane emotions; till, half recovering, he blushed\r\nto find his eyes dim, and his cheek stained by the pure tears of his\r\ndeep and unadulterated feeling. Turning hastily round, he was glad to\r\nobserve his companion somewhat behind him, and he reined in his horse\r\nthat he might approach. Pepi rode up with his measured pace; and it\r\nwould have been a curious study to remark the contrasted countenances of\r\nthe travellers: Castruccio, glorious in beauty; his deep eyes suffused\r\nwith tears, and his lips breathing passion and delight, was more\r\nopposite than light to dark, to the hard lines of Pepi's face, which\r\nwere unmoved as he glanced his small bright eyes from side to side,\r\nwhile no other sign shewed that he felt or thought; his mouth shut\r\nclose, his person stiff and strait, his knees pressing his mule's\r\nflanks, and his ungainly horsemanship easily betraying the secret, that\r\nhis feats in arms must have been performed on foot.\r\n\r\nAt length tired of silence, and willing to speak although to so\r\nunsympathizing a being, Castruccio asked: \"Messer Benedetto, you seemed\r\nlast night to groan under the weight of your hatred of the Florentines.\r\nNow I have good reason to hate them, since by their means my party was\r\nexiled, and Lucca ranks among the Guelphic cities of Tuscany. But you\r\nare of Cremona, a town separated from Florence by many mountains and\r\nrivers; whence therefore arises your abhorrence of this republic?\"\r\n\r\nPepi fixed his little piercing eyes upon Castruccio, as if to read into\r\nhis heart, and discover the secret motive of this question; but the\r\nfrank and noble beauty of his fellow-traveller was such, that it even\r\nhad an effect on this man's rigid soul; and, as he gazed on him, the\r\nhard lines of his face seemed to melt away, and he replied at first with\r\ngentleness; until, carried away by his subject, he poured forth the\r\ntorrent of his hatred with a warmth, strange to observe in one, who in\r\ncalmer moments appeared more as a man made of wood or leather, than of\r\nflesh and blood:\r\n\r\n\"My good friend, you say true, I hate the Florentines; yet I may well\r\nfind it difficult to tell the cause; for neither have they wounded me,\r\nnor stolen my purse, nor done me any other great injury of the like\r\nnature; but I am a Ghibeline, and therefore I hate them. And who would\r\nnot hate a people, that despise the emperor, and all lawful authority;\r\nthat have as it were dug up the buried form of Liberty, which died when\r\nMilan fell under the Visconti; who force their very nobles to become\r\nvulgar, and counts of the palace, and counts of the empire, to inscribe\r\ntheir names as weavers and furriers; who go about the world enriching\r\nthemselves by a wicked usury, and return and squander the money in\r\npurchasing licence for themselves? Is not their town filled with brawls,\r\nand are not their streets strewed with the ruins of the palaces of the\r\nnoble Ghibelines? Do they not one day undo the acts of the day before,\r\nand ever introduce more and more licence? Now create every two months a\r\nset of magistrates, who take all power out of the hands of the rich, and\r\nnow a captain of the people, who protects and raises the vile multitude,\r\ntill every lord must cap to his shoe-maker? The example is what I abhor;\r\nare not Lucca, Bologna and Sienna free? and the contagion spreads over\r\nLombardy. Oh! to every saint in heaven would I put up my prayer; to the\r\ndevil himself would I give my thanks (but that so good a work could\r\nnever have been done by his means), if, as was once proposed, the town\r\nof Florence had been razed, its streets sown with salt, and its\r\ninhabitants scattered like Jews and Sclavonians about the world. Curse\r\nthee, curse thee, Farinata, that through thy means this was not done!\"\r\n\r\n\"A disinterested love of the Imperial power causes these emotions? In\r\ntruth you are the warmest Ghibeline I ever knew.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend, the world, trust me, will never go well, until the rich\r\nrule, and the vulgar sink to their right station as slaves of the soil.\r\nYou will readily allow that war is the scourge of the world; now in free\r\ntowns war has a better harvest, than where proper and legitimate\r\nauthority is established. During war neither our persons, nor our lands,\r\nnor our houses are in safety; we may be wounded in brawls, our lands\r\nlaid waste, our houses and all our possessions despoiled. Now my plan is\r\neasy, simple, and practicable: if you are at all read in history, you\r\nmust know, that the fortunes of the nobles of antient Rome consisted in\r\nmany hundreds of slaves, whom they brought up to various trades and\r\narts, and then let them out to work, or permitted them to keep shops and\r\nmake money, which the masters received, paying them a small sum for\r\ntheir necessary support. Such is the order, which, if I were a prince, I\r\nwould establish, and every town, such as Florence, where all is noise\r\nand talk, should be reduced to silence and peace; about two thousand\r\nrich men should possess all the rest of the inhabitants, who, like\r\nsheep, would flock to their folds, and receive their pittances with\r\nthankfulness and humility.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if, instead of sheep, they were to be wolves, and turn rebels to\r\ntheir masters? Methinks their numbers would panic-strike their two\r\nthousand drivers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, then we would display our whips, and drive the flock to market.\r\nSlaves rebel! we would starve them into decent submission.\"\r\n\r\nCastruccio could not help being amused by the strange policy and earnest\r\nmanners of the Italian lawgiver, and replied: \"But, Messer Benedetto, I\r\ndispute your first proposition, and assert that there is as much war and\r\nbloodshed under kings, as in republics. You who have fought in Flanders,\r\nand I who have also visited England, know this to be true; yet in France\r\nand England the people do not mingle with the quarrels of the nobles; so\r\nI think you must mend your constitution, and reduce your two thousand\r\nslave-drivers of Florence to a single one; yet I am afraid that, if\r\nthere were only one in each town of Italy; or even if there were only\r\ntwo in the whole world, they would contrive to create war and\r\nbloodshed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" replied Pepi, with a groan, \"is the great fault that I find in\r\nthe constitution of the world. If the rich would only know their own\r\ninterests, we might chain the monster and again bury Liberty. But they\r\nare all fools; if the rich would agree, if the few princes that there\r\nneed exist in the world, would league in amity, instead of quarrelling,\r\nsuch a state as that of Florence would not subsist a year. But, if\r\nreason had a trump as loud as that which will awaken us at the last day,\r\nthe clash of arms of these senseless people would drown it. Now, if\r\ninstead of quarrelling, the Pope and Frederic Barbarossa had made a\r\nleague, all Italy would now be on its knees before this Henry of\r\nLuxembourgh. And one day this may be; mark my words; tyranny is a\r\nhealthy tree, it strikes a deep root, and each year its branches grow\r\nlarger and larger, and its shade spreads wider and wider. While liberty\r\nis a word, a breath, an air; it will dissipate, and Florence become as\r\nslavish as it is now rebellious; did not Rome fall?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am little acquainted with the history of antient times,\" said\r\nCastruccio gaily; \"but, since the world began, I can easily imagine that\r\nstates have risen and fallen; we are blind with regard to futurity, and\r\nmethinks it is foolish to build for a longer term than a man's life.\r\nKingdoms are as fragile as a porcelain vessel tossed by the ocean; nay,\r\nso very weak are they, that even the stars, those small, silly points of\r\nlight, are said to rule them; and often, when they are at their highest\r\nglory, God sends his scourges, pest or earthquake, to sink them for\r\never; let us work for ourselves alone; we may be obscure or famous,\r\ngrovelling as the worm, or lofty as the kingly eagle, according as our\r\ndesires sink or mount.\"\r\n\r\nDiscoursing thus they arrived at Turin, and were again entertained by a\r\nmerchant, the friend of Pepi. Here they found a numerous company, who\r\nall discoursed with warmth concerning the political state of Italy, and\r\npoured forth the most extravagant praises of the emperor Henry. He had\r\npassed two months in Piedmont, reconciling factions, hearing complaints,\r\nand destroying the vexatious tyrannies of its petty lords. Pepi, not\r\nconsidering this a fit occasion to poison these sanguine hopes by his\r\nprophecies, sat in silence with elevated brows and pressed lips, turning\r\nhis sharp eyes from one speaker to another, as if by their means to\r\ndrink in all the intelligence the politicians were able to afford.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Pepi and Castruccio parted; whether this was caused by\r\nthe necessities or the prudence of the former cannot be determined. He\r\nalleged that his business called him to Alessandria in his way to\r\nCremona, and the road of Castruccio lay directly for Milan. On parting\r\nPepi made a speech, expressive of his gratitude, and the return he was\r\nwilling to render for the benefit he had received; which was a welcome\r\nto his house and board, whenever his preserver should pass through\r\nCremona. \"Yet,\" he added, \"if you have any other friends in that town,\r\nyou may be will prefer them to me. I have, as I related yesterday,\r\nsuffered many losses, and am endeavouring to repair them by an\r\n\u0153conomical mode of life; I have no rich wines or soft couches, and can\r\nneither afford to burn wax lights, nor to eat delicate food. I have a\r\ngood tower to my house; and, now that I am a knight, I shall have a good\r\nhorse in my stable; and that is all I have to boast. You seem to have no\r\ntaste for coarse fare or hard beds; and therefore my dwelling would in\r\nno manner be agreeable to you.\"\r\n\r\nCastruccio thanked him, and carelessly replied, that, as a soldier, he\r\nhad been accustomed to hardship and privation, nor would the poverty of\r\nPepi's dwelling render it less worthy in his eyes; and they coldly took\r\nleave of one another, Pepi trotting gravely on the road towards\r\nAlessandria, his head full of plans which he kept carefully locked up in\r\nhis own brain, and his hard lined face, faithful to his commands, giving\r\nno indications of what was passing in his soul.\r\n\r\nCastruccio rode on gaily towards Milan; the cheerless wintry sky and the\r\ncold air could not tame his buoyant spirits or his hopes. He panted for\r\naction, for distinction, and for power; yet he no longer desired these\r\nthings as a boy, unknowing of the road which led to them. During the\r\ninterval which he had spent in England and France, he had studied human\r\nnature with the observant eye of genius; and, all careless as he\r\nappeared to be, he had learned how to please the multitude, how to\r\nflatter the foibles of the noble, and thus to gain the hearts of men and\r\nto rule them. Under Alberto Scoto he had revolved with care the\r\npolitical state of Italy, such as that commander had pictured it to him;\r\nhis plans of lordship and conquest were already formed; he had only the\r\nfirst step to make, to proceed afterwards with a swift pace to the goal\r\nfor which he panted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\n_Milan.--Court of the Emperor Henry.--Arrigo\r\nGuinigi.--Sack of Cremona.--Benedetto\r\nPepi._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter several days travelling, he arrived at Milan; and his first care\r\nwas to hasten to the palace of Matteo Visconti. This chief was gone to\r\nthe meeting of the senate, deliberating with the nobles of Milan on the\r\nsum of money which should be voted for the use of the emperor.\r\nCastruccio was therefore introduced to his son, Galeazzo, who was then\r\nin the hall of the palace, surrounded by all the young Ghibeline\r\nnobility of Milan. It was a scene of gaiety and splendour. The young\r\nnobles were preparing to attend on the emperor in a royal hunt. They\r\nwere attired with the utmost magnificence, with full dresses of\r\nembroidered silk, cloth, or velvet, and cloaks of precious furs; some\r\nwere accoutred in short gowns with trowsers tied in the same manner as\r\nthat of Pepi, but made of fine linen and embossed silks; their collars\r\nwere ornamented with strings of pearl. Their hair, parted equally on the\r\nforehead, was curled and fell down as far as the shoulders; they wore\r\ndifferent kinds of caps, some flat and adorned with plumes of feathers,\r\nothers high and pointed, and the lower part twisted round with pearls\r\nfastened with a rich broach; most of them held a falcon on his fist, or\r\ncaressed a favourite hound, or vaunted the prowess of a noble steed.\r\nThere were many ladies in company who seemed to vie with their male\r\ncompanions in luxury of dress. Their gowns were made of the same costly\r\nstuffs, and ornamented with greater profusion of precious stones; their\r\nwide sleeves which fell almost to the ground were edged with pearls,\r\nwhile underneath, a small sleeve of the finest silk fitted tight to the\r\narm; the borders of their dresses were richly embroidered with pearls or\r\ngolden beads; they wore their veils adorned with the same richness, and\r\nsmall capuchins of oriental fur bordered with fringes of gold and\r\npearls; and their girdles were studded with the most splendid stones.\r\n\r\nCastruccio paused, half dazzled by the scene. In the ruder courts of\r\nLondon or Paris he had never seen so much splendour and luxury: he cast\r\nan involuntary glance on his own habiliments, which although rich were\r\nsoiled by travelling, and in their best days could not have vied with\r\nthe meanest dress worn by these nobles. He quickly however recovered his\r\nself-possession; and his name, whose sound had passed the Alps, and been\r\nrepeated with enthusiasm by many of the followers of the emperor who had\r\nserved with him in the Low Countries, caused this brilliant assembly to\r\nreceive him with flattering distinction. They crowded round him, and\r\ncourteously invited him to partake of their amusements; while his\r\nhandsome person won the smiles of the ladies who were present. Galeazzo\r\nVisconti received him with that kindness and cordiality which was then\r\nin fashion among the Italians; and he, as the most courteous cavalier of\r\nthe country, was well versed in all the politeness of the age.\r\nCastruccio was provided with a beautiful horse, and a mantle of rich fur\r\nbefitting the cold season, and made one of the gay and splendid band as\r\nthey rode towards the palace of the emperor; here they were joined by\r\nthe sovereign himself, the empress, and the noble Germans of his\r\nretinue. Riding through the streets of Milan, they quitted the city at\r\nthe eastern gate, and dividing into various parties; spread themselves\r\nabroad in search of game. The Germans followed the dogs through the open\r\ncountry, chasing down foxes and hares; while the Italians, who were\r\ndressed for gala, and would not risk their fine silks among the brambles\r\nand impediments of the fields, were content with unmuffling their\r\nfalcons when they saw game aloft, and making bets on the superior speed\r\nof their several birds.\r\n\r\nDuring the first part of the ride Galeazzo observed Castruccio, who\r\nappeared to be too much wrapped up in his own thoughts to attend to the\r\ndiscourse of the gay throng around him. He loitered behind, that he\r\nmight indulge in his reveries; and Galeazzo, who had separated himself\r\nfrom the rest, now rode up to him; and they entered into a conversation\r\ntogether, which at length turned into a discussion of the plans and\r\nwishes of Castruccio. They were both men of caution and prudence; yet,\r\nbeing young, they were susceptible of impressions to which men lose\r\ntheir sensibility as they advance in years. They were mutually pleased\r\nwith each other; and a single glance, a single word, sufficed to make\r\neach understand the other, and to unite them in the bonds of friendship.\r\n\r\nCastruccio asked what it was believed that the designs of the emperor\r\nwere; and Galeazzo replied: \"You would hardly guess what anxious hearts,\r\nthrobbing with distrust and fear, are concealed under the apparent\r\ngaiety of these hunters. We Milanese are full of dissentions and\r\nambition; and I, as a chief among them, have my head well loaded with\r\ncare and doubt, while I follow this joyous train with my falcon on my\r\nfist. In a few days the game will be up; and we shall see what power the\r\nVisconti or the Della Torre will have over Lombardy. At present wait.\r\nThe emperor is expecting supplies of money, and we are voting them for\r\nhim with apparent zeal: you, as a politician, must well know that money\r\nis the great mover of all change in a state. I prophesy change; but you\r\nas a stranger, must stand aloof, and be guided by circumstances. In the\r\nmean time make friends; attach yourself to the emperor and to the lords\r\nof Lombardy, many of whom are extremely powerful; and rest assured, that\r\nwhether he be successful or not, he will not quit Italy without\r\nendeavouring to change the politics of the Tuscan republics. Now let us\r\njoin our friends; to-morrow I will talk further with you; and, if we have\r\nrecourse to arms, I need not say how proud I should be in having my\r\nparty distinguished by the acquisition of Castruccio dei Antelminelli.\"\r\n\r\nThey then mingled with the rest of the company; and Galeazzo introduced\r\nhis new friend to the Ghibeline lords of Lombardy. He here saw for the\r\nfirst time the magnificent Cane della Scala, lord of Verona, and the\r\ngenerous Guido della Polenta, lord of Ravenna, and father of the unhappy\r\nFrancesca of Rimini. These nobles had assembled at Milan, to be present\r\nat the coronation of the emperor, which had taken place a few weeks\r\nbefore; all wore the appearance of gaiety and good humour; the empress\r\nheaded the band, accompanied by a beautiful youth who bore a bow in his\r\nhand; and Cane della Scala was beside her, descanting on the merits of\r\nhis falcon. Castruccio was struck by the countenance of the youth who\r\nrode near the empress. He was dressed with a profusion of magnificence;\r\nat his back he wore a gilt quiver studded with gems, and a scarf\r\nembroidered with pearls was thrown over one shoulder, and tied under the\r\nother arm; in every way he was accoutred as might become the favourite\r\npage of an empress. Yet Castruccio thought that he remembered those\r\nlight blue eyes; and his sweet yet serious smile filled his own with\r\ntears of tender recollection. He eagerly asked Galeazzo who and what he\r\nwas: his friend replied; \"He is the squire of Can' Grande, and he is\r\ncalled; Arrigo I do not know what other name he bears; the empress\r\nwishes to attach him to her suite; but the youth would prefer bearing\r\narms under his munificent patron, to the situation of the effeminate\r\npage of a queen's anti-chamber.\"\r\n\r\n\"That cannot surprize me,\" said Castruccio; \"for his infancy was spent\r\nin the labour of the fields, and in listening to the lessons of his\r\ngodlike father; he must therefore be ill prepared to enter into the\r\nintrigues and follies of a court. If he have not forgotten his childish\r\naffection for me, I shall win him from them both; and, if indeed his\r\nfather be dead, it shall be my pride and boast to be the protector of\r\nhis Arrigo.\"\r\n\r\nAs they re-entered the gates of the town, the trains of the emperor and\r\nempress joined; and, Arrigo falling back among the nobles, Castruccio\r\nrode up to him. For some time he gazed on him, and heard the gentle\r\ntones of his youthful voice; he dared not speak; his heart was full; and\r\nto his eyes dimmed by emotion, he fancied that the revered form of\r\nGuinigi stood beside his son, smiled on Castruccio, and pointed to the\r\nboy. At length, recovering himself, he came abreast with the horse of\r\nArrigo, and whispered, \"Does the son of Guinigi forget me? does he\r\nforget the farm among the Euganean hills?\"\r\n\r\nArrigo started; his countenance became radiant with joy; and he\r\nexclaimed, \"My own Castruccio!\"\r\n\r\nThey rode away from the company, and entered the town by more lonely\r\nstreets. Castruccio saw by the looks of his young friend, that his worst\r\nfears were true, and that Guinigi was dead; and Arrigo easily read in\r\nCastruccio's face that he was thinking of his father. At length he said:\r\n\"My brother, if so you will permit me to call you, a year has now passed\r\nsince I was left an orphan; ten months ago I quitted my happy life among\r\nthe hills, to dwell with a patron, who is indeed munificent and kind to\r\nme; but who is not as my father. It appears to me a vision that such a\r\nbeing ever existed; he was so great, so angelically wise and good; and I\r\nnow float down the stream with the rest, an esquire, an attendant; I\r\npass my life without enjoyment, and look forward to the future without\r\npleasure; but if, my brother, you would grant me one request, a brighter\r\nsun would shine upon me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dearest Arrigo, my dear, dear brother, I read in your earnest looks all\r\nthat you would say; be assured we shall never part again! We will sally\r\nforth soldiers of fortune; and the same star shall ascend and descend\r\nfor both.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, leave the rest to me; be it my task to contrive my departure\r\nfrom Can' della Scala; inform me of your motions, and fear not but that\r\nI shall be at your side.\"\r\n\r\nThat same evening a magnificent feast was given at the palace of the\r\nemperor; and Castruccio was introduced to this prince by Galeazzo. The\r\nlords of Lombardy regarded him with a favourable eye; for they knew that\r\nhe could not hurt their interests north of the Apennines, and they hoped\r\nthat by his means the Ghibeline faction might revive and triumph in\r\nTuscany.\r\n\r\nCastruccio spent almost the whole evening in conversation with Arrigo.\r\nFor the youth would not absent himself from him, but recalled with\r\nearnest affection all the circumstances of their former intercourse; and\r\nrelated with tears the death of Guinigi; a death, calm as his most\r\ninnocent life. One afternoon, during the heats of summer, he sat under\r\na cypress with his son, and entered into an anxious detail of what would\r\nbe the prospects and probable fate of the young Arrigo, when he, his\r\nfather and protector, should be no more. The boy, struck with a\r\nmelancholy foreboding, intreated him not to dwell on a period, which was\r\nfar distant, and which, when it approached, would bring to him nothing\r\nbut despair. Guinigi however told him that he would not be overruled in\r\nthis, and with earnest affection talked for hours on the subject with a\r\nwisdom and goodness that appeared more than human. \"Alas,\" said Arrigo,\r\n\"even as he spoke, I thought I saw his eyes beam with a heavenly light,\r\nand the torrent of impressive words that he poured forth, were uttered\r\nwith a voice deep and tender, filling the air as it were with a harmony\r\nsweeter than any earthly music. I listened, till I became almost as a\r\nstatue with attention; and as he either exhorted to virtue, or described\r\nthe evils of my country, or marked forth the glorious or peaceful path\r\nthat I might pursue, I felt my countenance change, as I have seen a\r\ncloud vary as it passes before the moon, now, as it advances, beaming in\r\na silver light, and then again fading into darkness. At length he\r\ndismissed me, saying that he wished to sleep, and I saw him stretch\r\nhimself under the cypress, gazing on the sky, whose dazzling light was\r\nsoftened by the dark foliage through which it passed; and he slept never\r\nto wake again.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! what I then suffered, when our friends crowded round, and the\r\nmourning women came, and the mummery of the funeral went on! But all\r\nthat is passed; and now I should again feel the elasticity of youth, but\r\nthat I was, until you returned, friendless in the world.\"\r\n\r\nThey talked thus, while the company around them were amusing themselves,\r\nwith dances and song; the feast broke up late; and it broke up only to\r\nbe renewed with greater zeal the following and the following day. Yet,\r\nwhile all appeared so calm, the storm which the politicians\r\nprognosticated, broke out, and the quiet of these festive meetings was\r\ndisturbed by the revolt of Milan against the Germans. And now Castruccio\r\nwas witness for the first time to the popular commotions of his country:\r\narmed knights galloped through the streets crying, \"_Libert\u00e0!_ Death to\r\nthe Germans!\" And a multitude of the people, who were enraged at the new\r\ntaxes imposed upon them, joined in the cry. But the revolt thus quickly\r\nexcited, was as quickly appeased. The Visconti after some hesitation\r\nranged themselves under the emperor; and Della Torre and his partizans\r\nwere obliged to fly; their houses were razed, their goods confiscated,\r\nand themselves declared traitors.\r\n\r\nBut the effects of the Milanese revolt were not so easily removed. The\r\nvarious Guelph towns of Lombardy, Crema, Cremona, Brescia, Lodi, and\r\nComo, set up the standard of revolt against the emperor; and, spring\r\nhaving now advanced, Henry began his campaign with the attempt to reduce\r\nthese towns. Castruccio had received from him permission to raise a\r\ntroop of volunteers, to serve under his command in the Imperial army,\r\nand his fame collected a brave band, whose discipline and valour were\r\nthe admiration of the other generals.\r\n\r\nCrema and Lodi submitted to the emperor on his advance, and reaped from\r\ntheir unseasonable resistance an increase of those vexations which had\r\ncaused their revolt. Henry marched against Cremona, which at first made\r\nshew of resistance; but, when the Guelphs, hopeless of success, escaped\r\nfrom the town, the Ghibelines surrendered to the emperor; who,\r\nunmollified by their submission, punished his own innocent partizans,\r\nsending them to cruel prisons, razing the walls and fortifications of\r\nthe town, and delivering over the property and persons of the\r\nunprotected citizens into the hands of the brutal Germans who composed\r\nthe greater part of his army.\r\n\r\nCastruccio entered Cremona at the head of his little troop, and beheld\r\nwith dismay the cruel effects of the conquest of the emperor over this\r\ncity. Most of the German soldiers were busy in destroying the\r\nfortifications; or in compelling the peasants and citizens to raze the\r\nwalls of their town. Other parties were ranging about the streets,\r\nentering the palaces, whose rich furniture they destroyed, by feasting,\r\nand tearing down from the walls all that had the appearance of gold or\r\nsilver. The cellars were broken open; and, after inebriating themselves\r\nwith the choice wines of Italy, the unruly, but armed bands were in a\r\nbetter mood for oppressing the defenceless people. Some of these poor\r\nwretches fled to the open country; others locked themselves up in their\r\nhouses, and, throwing what they possessed from the windows, strove to\r\nsave their persons from the brutality of their conquerors. Many of the\r\nnoble females took refuge in the meanest cottages, and disguised\r\nthemselves in poor clothing, till, frightened by the eager glances, or\r\nbrutal address of the soldiers, they escaped to the country, and\r\nremained exposed to hunger and cold among the woods that surrounded the\r\ntown. Others, with their hair dishevelled, their dresses in disorder,\r\ncareless of the eyes which gazed on them, followed their husbands and\r\nfathers to their frightful prisons, some in mute despair, many wringing\r\ntheir hands, and crying aloud for mercy. As night came on, the soldiery,\r\ntired of rapine, went to rest in the beds from which the proprietors\r\nwere remorselessly banished: silence prevailed; a dreadful silence,\r\nbroken sometimes by the shriek of an injured female, or the brutal\r\nshouts of some of the men, who passed the night in going from palace to\r\npalace, calling up the inhabitants, demanding food and wine, and on the\r\nslightest shew of resistance hurrying their victims to prison, or\r\nbinding them in their own houses with every aggravation of insult.\r\n\r\nCastruccio divided his little band, and sent his men to the protection\r\nof several of the palaces, while he and Arrigo rode all night about the\r\ntown; and, having the watchword of the emperor, they succeeded in\r\nrescuing some poor wretches from the brutality of the insolent soldiers.\r\nSeveral days followed, bringing with them a repetition of the same\r\nscenes; and the hardest heart might have been struck with compassion, to\r\nsee the misery painted on the faces of many, whose former lives had been\r\na continual dream of pleasure; young mothers weeping over their\r\nunfortunate offspring, whose fathers lay rotting or starving in prison;\r\nchildren crying for bread, sitting on the steps of their paternal\r\npalaces, within which the military rioted in plenty; childless parents,\r\nmourning their murdered babes; orphans, helpless, dying, whose parents\r\ncould no longer soothe or relieve them. Castruccio, though a soldier,\r\nwept; but Arrigo, who had never before witnessed the miseries of war,\r\nbecame almost frenzied with the excess of his compassion and\r\nindignation; he poured forth curses loud and bitter, while his eyes\r\nstreamed tears, and his voice, broken and sharp, was insufficient to\r\nconvey his passionate abhorrence. Castruccio was at length obliged to\r\nuse violence to draw him from this scene of misery; and, after soothing\r\nhim by every argument he could use, and by the most powerful of all,\r\nthat Henry would be soon obliged to withdraw his soldiers from Cremona\r\nto serve him at the siege of Brescia, he dispatched the youth with a\r\nletter to Galeazzo Visconti.\r\n\r\nReturning to the town, Castruccio saw a figure pass along at the end of\r\nthe street, which reminded him of one whom he had almost\r\nforgotten--Benedetto Pepi. \"Alas! poor fellow,\" said Castruccio to\r\nhimself, \"you will find the pillage of the Germans a tremendous evil.\r\nWell; as I restored your life once, I will now try, if I am not too\r\nlate, to save the remnant of your property.\"\r\n\r\nHe enquired of a passenger for the house of Benedetto Pepi. \"If you mean\r\nBenedetto the Rich, if any can now be called rich in this miserable\r\ncity,\" replied the man, \"I will conduct you to his house.\"\r\n\r\n\"My Pepi ought rather, I think, to be called the poor; lead me however\r\nto Benedetto the Rich; and if he be a tall, gaunt figure with a\r\nwrinkled, leathern face, he is the man for whom I enquire.\"\r\n\r\nCastruccio was conducted to a palace in the highest and most commanding\r\npart of the town, built of large blocks of stone, and apparently firm\r\nand solid enough to bear a siege. The windows were few, small, grated\r\nand sunk deep in the wall; it had a high tower, whose port-holes shewed\r\nthat it was of uncommon strength and thickness; a parapet built with\r\nturrets surrounded it at the top, and in every respect the mansion\r\nresembled more a castle, than a palace. The entrance was dark; and, by\r\nthe number of grooves, it appeared as if there had been many doors; but\r\nthey were all removed, and the entrance free. Castruccio advanced: there\r\nwere two large halls on the ground-floor, on each side of the\r\nentrance-court; both were filled with German soldiers; they were high,\r\ndark, bare rooms, more like the apartments of a prison than a palace. In\r\none of them a number of beds were laid on the paved floor; in the other\r\nthere was a large fire in the middle, at which various persons were\r\nemployed in the offices of cookery, and near this, a table was spread\r\nout with immense quantities of food, haunches of boiled beef, and black\r\nbread; two boys stood at either end of the table, each holding a large\r\nflaring torch; and the soldiers with riotous exclamations were choosing\r\ntheir seats on the benches that were placed around. Castruccio paused,\r\nunable to discern whether Pepi were among this strange company. At\r\nlength he observed him standing in one corner filling large jugs from a\r\nbarrel of wine: he accosted him with a voice of condolence; and Pepi\r\nlooked up with his little bright eyes, and a face rather expressive of\r\njoy than sorrow. After he had recognized his guest, he left his wine\r\nbarrel, and invited him into another room, for they could hardly\r\ndistinguish each other's voices amidst the shouts and tumult of the rude\r\nfeasters. They ascended the steep narrow stairs; and, Castruccio\r\ncomplaining of want of light, Pepi said: \"Let us go to the top of my\r\ntower; the sun has been set about ten minutes, and, although dark every\r\nwhere else, it will be light there. If you will wait a short time I will\r\nget the key.\"\r\n\r\nPepi descended the stairs; and from a small port-hole Castruccio saw him\r\ncross the court, and then in a few minutes return with cautious and\r\nobservant steps. When he came near Castruccio, he said: \"Those German\r\nruffians are now eating and drinking, and will not mark us; yet let us\r\ntread lightly, for I have admitted none of them to my tower, nor is it\r\nmy intention to do so. It is a place of strength; and the little I have\r\nin the world is preserved here, which little in spite of the emperor and\r\nhis devils I will preserve.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the tower had appeared large without, yet its walls were so\r\nthick that there was only room left within for a small circular\r\nstaircase; at the top of this Pepi undrew the bolts, pushed up a\r\ntrap-door, and they ascended to the platform on the outside. The sky was\r\ndarkening; but the west was tinged with a deep orange colour, and the\r\nwide and dusky plain of Lombardy lay far extended all around:\r\nimmediately below was the town of Cremona, which to them appeared as\r\nsilent and peaceful as if the inhabitants were in the enjoyment of\r\nperfect security. They continued some minutes gazing silently,\r\nCastruccio on the wide extent of scenery before him, Pepi on the thick\r\nwalls of his tower. At length the former said; \"An evil star pursues\r\nyou, Messer Benedetto, and I am afraid that you were born in the descent\r\nof some evil constellation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless,\" replied Pepi: yet there was an indescribable expression in\r\nhis countenance and manner, that startled his companion; his eyes\r\nsparkled, and the lines of his face, as plainly as such things could\r\nspeak, spoke joy and exultation. His voice however was drawn out into\r\naccents of grief, and he ended his reply by a groan.\r\n\r\n\"Your palace is wasted by these ruffians.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, there is nothing to waste; the walls are too thick to be hurt, and\r\nI removed every thing else before they came.\"\r\n\r\n\"They consume your food.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have none to consume. I am a poor, lone man, and had no food in the\r\nhouse for them. They bring their rapine here; I send my squire for wood,\r\nwherever he can collect it; I make a fire, and they dress their food;\r\nand that is all that they get by me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you lost no friend or relation in the war?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no one whom I love; I have met with undutifulness and\r\ningratitude, but no kindness or friendship; so I should not have\r\nmourned, if my relations had fallen; but they are all safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it would appear, that you have lost nothing by the havock of these\r\nGermans, and that you are still Benedetto the Rich.\"\r\n\r\nPepi had answered the previous questions of Castruccio with vivacity,\r\nand an expression of triumph and vanity, which he in vain strove to\r\nconceal; his brows were elevated, a smile lurked in the corners of his\r\nstrait lips, and he even rubbed his hands. But, when Castruccio spoke\r\nthese last words, his face fell, his mouth was drawn down, his arms sunk\r\nclose to his sides, and, glancing at his mean clothing, he replied: \"I\r\nam always poor, always unfortunate; and, Messer Castruccio, you do me\r\ngreat injustice and injury by supposing that I have any wealth. I have a\r\nwell built palace, and a strong tower; but I can neither eat the stones,\r\nnor clothe myself with the plaster; and, God knows, my possessions are\r\nnow reduced to fifty small acres; how therefore can I be rich?\"\r\n\r\n\"At least, if you are poor,\" replied Castruccio, \"your unfortunate\r\ntownsmen share your misfortunes. Their habitations are pillaged; those\r\nthat escape the ravage of the emperor, are driven out, starving and\r\nmiserable, from the only dwellings, be they palaces or cottages, which\r\nthey possess.\"\r\n\r\nThe countenance of Pepi again lighted up, his eyes sparkled, and, he\r\nsaid; \"Aye, aye, many are fallen; but not so low--not so low: they have\r\nstill lands, they are not quite destitute, and the dead have heirs----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed, heirs to famine and indignity; unhappy orphans! far more\r\nmiserable than if they had died with those who gave them birth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, I pity them from my soul; but I also have suffered losses. The\r\nfirst party of Germans that broke into the town, seized upon my horse,\r\nand my squire's gelding: I must buy others when our enemies are gone, to\r\nkeep up the honour of my knighthood. But, enough of this. You, Messer\r\nCastruccio, have a troop of Italians, horsemen, I believe, under your\r\ncommand: what do you intend to do with them? Do you stay in Lombardy, or\r\nfollow the emperor south?\"\r\n\r\n\"Events are now my masters; soon I hope to rule them, but at present I\r\nshall be guided by accident, and cannot therefore answer your question.\"\r\n\r\nPepi paused a few moments, and at length said, half to himself; \"No;\r\nthis is not the time; events are as yet unripe; this siege has done\r\nmuch, but I must still delay;----well, Messer Castruccio, at present I\r\nwill not reveal some circumstances, which, when we began this\r\nconversation, I had thought to confide to your discretion. Sometime,\r\nperhaps when you least expect it, we shall meet again; and if Benedetto\r\nof Cremona be not exactly what he seems, keep the secret until then, and\r\nI shall rest your obliged servant. Now, farewel. You came to offer your\r\nservices to save my palace; I am a prudent man, and ordered my affairs\r\nso, that it ran no risk; yet I am indebted to you for this, and for your\r\nother generous act in my behalf; a time may come when we shall know one\r\nanother better. Again farewel.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech was delivered with a grave and mysterious mien, and a face\r\nthat signified careful thought and important expectations. When he had\r\nended, Pepi opened the trap-door, and he and Castruccio descended slowly\r\ndown the now benighted staircase into the court of the palace: here they\r\nagain interchanged salutations, and parted. Pepi joined his boisterous\r\nguests, and Castruccio rode towards the camp of the emperor. He mused as\r\nhe went upon what the words of his strange acquaintance might portend;\r\nhis curiosity was for a time excited by them; but change of place and\r\nthe bustle of action made him soon forget the existence of Benedetto the\r\nRich, of Cremona.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\n_Death of the Emperor.--Uguccione, tyrant of\r\nPisa, restores Castruccio at Lucca.--Euthanasia._\r\n\r\n\r\nQuitting Cremona, Henry engaged himself in the siege of Brescia, which\r\nmade a gallant resistance, and yielded only on honourable conditions, in\r\nthe month of September. Castruccio served under the emperor during this\r\nsiege; but his nature was shocked by the want of faith and cruelty of\r\nthis monarch, who punished his enemies by the most frightful tortures,\r\nand treated his friends as if they had been his enemies. Castruccio\r\ntherefore resolved to separate himself from the Imperial army; and, when\r\nHenry quitted Lombardy for Genoa, he remained with his friend, Galeazzo\r\nVisconti.\r\n\r\nThe petty wars of Lombardy could only interest those engaged in them;\r\nand all eyes were turned towards the emperor during his journey to\r\nGenoa, his unsuccessful negotiations with Florence, his voyage to Pisa,\r\nhis journey to Rome; where, the Vatican being in the hands of the\r\ncontrary party, he was crowned in the Lateran. And then, his army\r\ndiminished by sickness, and himself chagrined by the slow progress of\r\nhis arms, he returned to Tuscany, made an unsuccessful attack upon\r\nFlorence, and retired to the neighbourhood of Sienna, where he died on\r\nthe eighteenth of August 1313; leaving Italy nearly in the same\r\nsituation with regard to the preponderance of the Guelph party, but more\r\nheated and violent in their factious sentiments, as when he entered it\r\ntwo years before.\r\n\r\nDuring this long contest Florence was the head and heart of the\r\nresistance made against the emperor. Their detestation of the Imperial\r\npower, and their fears of the restoration of their banished Ghibelines,\r\nexcited them to exert their utmost faculties, in gaining allies, and in\r\nthe defence of their own town. The death of Henry was to them a\r\nbloodless victory; and they hoped that a speedy change in the politics\r\nof Italy would establish the universal ascendancy of the Guelphic party.\r\n\r\nPisa had always been constant to the Ghibelines, and friendly to the\r\nemperor; by his death they found themselves thrown almost without\r\ndefence into the hands of the Florentines, their enemies; and they\r\ntherefore gladly acceded to the moderate terms offered to them by the\r\nking of Naples and his ally, Florence, for the establishment of peace in\r\nTuscany. If this treaty had been fulfilled, the hopes of the Ghibelines\r\nwould have been crushed for ever, nor would Castruccio ever have\r\nreturned to his country; the scenes of blood and misery which followed\r\nwould have been spared; and Florence, raising its benign influence over\r\nthe other Tuscan states, would have been the peace-maker of Italy.\r\nEvents took a different turn. To understand this it is necessary to look\r\nback.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the death of Henry, the Pisans, fearful of a sudden\r\nincursion of the Florentines, for which they might be unprepared, had\r\nengaged in their service a _condottiere_, Uguccione della Faggiuola, who\r\nwith his troop of a thousand Germans, took on him the guard of their\r\ncity. War was the trade of Uguccione; he therefore looked with dismay on\r\nthe projected peace, and resolved to disturb it. The populace of the\r\nItalian towns, ranged under party names, and ever obedient to the\r\nwatchword and signals of their party, were easily moved to fall on the\r\ncontrary faction. The Pisan people were Ghibelines; and, while the more\r\nmoderate among them had advanced far in the negociating of a peace,\r\nUguccione caused live eagles, the ensigns of the Ghibelines, to be\r\ncarried through the streets; and the cry of, \"Treason from the Guelphs!\"\r\nwas the rallying word of fury to the populace. The magistrates in vain\r\nendeavoured to assert their authority; their partizans were dispersed,\r\ntheir captains taken prisoners and put to death, and Uguccione declared\r\ngeneral of the war against the Florentines. This active chieftain lost\r\nno time in his operations; he marched against the Lucchese, the allies\r\nof Florence, ravaged their country, brought them to terms, and made\r\npeace with them on condition of their recalling their Ghibeline exiles.\r\n\r\nThe three years which these events occupied were spent by Castruccio in\r\nLombardy. He made each year a campaign under one or another of the\r\nGhibeline lords of that territory, and passed the winter at Milan. He\r\nformed a sincere and lasting friendship with Galeazzo Visconti: but,\r\nalthough this amity contributed to his advancement, his character\r\nsuffered by the congeniality of sentiment which he acquired with this\r\nchief. As they rode, hunted, or fought together, often employed in\r\nmutual good-offices one for the other, their affection became stronger;\r\nand it was as disinterested and generous as it was firm. Galeazzo\r\nsincerely loved Castruccio, and opened to him the dearest secrets of his\r\nheart; but these secrets were such as to initiate the latter in the\r\nartful policy and unprincipled motives of the Milanese lord, and to make\r\nhim regard treachery and cruelty as venial faults. He had no saving\r\npassion, which by its purity and exalted nature, although it permitted\r\nhim to forgive, would make him avoid the faults of Galeazzo. Ambition\r\nwas the ruling feeling of his soul; an ambition for power, conquest and\r\nrenown, and not for virtue, and that fame, which as the ph\u0153nix, cannot\r\nlive at the same period as its parent, but springs from his ashes with\r\nthe strong pinions of immortal being.\r\n\r\nIt was this aspiring disposition which strongly recommended him to\r\nGaleazzo. For it was not with him the wild desire for what he had\r\nneither qualities nor capacity to obtain; it was combined with\r\ntranscendant talents, an energy of action and a clearness of judgement,\r\nwhich greatly surpassed that of his companions. Castruccio was fond of\r\npower; yet he was neither arrogant nor tyrannical; words of kindness and\r\nwinning smiles he bestowed at will on all around. He appeared to fit\r\nhimself for each scene in which he was to take a part; in the camp he\r\nwas energetic, valorous, and swift of action; in council he was as\r\nprudent and cautious as a grey-haired minister of state; at balls, or\r\nduring a hunting party, he recommended himself by grace, agility, wit,\r\nand a courtesy whose sweetness was untarnished by vanity or presumption.\r\nHis beauty took a more manly cast; and somewhat of pride, and more of\r\nself-confidence, and much of sensibility, were seen in his upturned lip;\r\nhis eyes, dark as a raven's wing, were full of fire and imagination; his\r\nopen forehead was shaded by the hyacinthine curls of his\r\nchesnut-coloured hair. His face expressed extreme frankness, a frankness\r\nthat did not exist in his mind; for his practices among the wily chiefs\r\nof Lombardy had robbed him of all ingenuousness of soul, although the\r\ntraces of that which he once possessed had not faded from his\r\ncountenance. Amidst all the luxury of Lombardy he was abstemious, nor\r\nspent in personal magnificence the money which he rather applied to the\r\nequipment of his troop. At length the patient improvement which he had\r\nbestowed upon his powers, and his perseverance in preparing for\r\nadvancement, obtained their due reward; and he among the other Lucchese\r\nexiles returned to his native city.\r\n\r\nBut Castruccio was ill content to return as is were by the endurance of\r\nthe opposite party; on the contrary he wished to raise his faction to\r\nthat supremacy which would invest him with dominion as its chief. He\r\ntherefore carried on a treaty with Uguccione's army, requiring their\r\nassistance for the overthrow of the Guelphs of Lucca, and for placing\r\nhim in authority over his native town; while the tyrant of Pisa should\r\nin return gain a faithful ally, and one more step should be taken\r\ntowards the final establishment of the Ghibeline ascendancy.\r\n\r\nAfter arranging this scheme, Castruccio and his companions passed the\r\ndefile of the Serchio; and, advancing towards Lucca, assumed a warlike\r\nappearance, and endeavoured to force the gate of San Frediano; the\r\nGuelphs opposed him, and a battle ensued. In the mean time Uguccione\r\narrived in another direction, and, not finding free entrance at any of\r\nthe gates, began to batter the wall. The Guelphs, defeated by the\r\nGhibelines, were in no condition to resist; the Ghibelines, headed by\r\nCastruccio, considered Uguccione as their ally, and thought not of\r\nimpeding his operations; indeed they were fully employed in resisting\r\ntheir adversaries, who, though worsted, would not yield. The breach was\r\neffected, Uguccione entered triumphantly, and, treating Lucca as a\r\nconquered town, delivered it over to be sacked by his troops; while he\r\nhimself made a rich booty of the treasure of the Pope which had been\r\npreserved in the church of San Frediano; Lucca having been selected as\r\nthe safest deposit for such a treasure.\r\n\r\nUguccione thought no more of his promises to Castruccio, and both\r\nparties in Lucca were oppressed alike, by one who believed that the best\r\nsecurity for a governor was the cutting off the tallest flowers in the\r\nfield. The prompt exertions of Castruccio alone saved his native city\r\nfrom utter ruin. He collected his partizans, formed them into a troop,\r\nand ranging them under the banners of Uguccione, accepted a command in\r\nthis chief's army; thus quieting the invaders' fears of a resistance\r\nwhich would have been rash and vain, but having at the same time ready\r\nat Castruccio's smallest signal a well armed and disciplined troop,\r\nnominally in the service of the tyrant, but really devoted by affection\r\nand military oaths to the cause of their immediate commander. Nor did he\r\nagain betray the confidence of his fellow citizens; but, entering into\r\nUguccione's counsels, and assuming a tone of power which this chieftain\r\ncould not resist, Castruccio at the same time opposed a boundary to his\r\narrogance and cruelty.\r\n\r\nBut, although his first imprudence in inviting Uguccione to the\r\npossession of Lucca was pardoned by his countrymen, in consideration of\r\nthe reparation that he earnestly desired to make, it was looked upon\r\nwith far different eyes by states who, hating the Pisan Tyrant, and too\r\ndistant to be acquainted with all the palliating circumstances, regarded\r\nCastruccio as a traitor. The news of the entrance of the Ghibeline\r\nexiles into Lucca, and the capture of that town by Uguccione, quickly\r\nreached his Florentine adversaries, and excited grief and rage in all\r\nthe hearers. The name of Castruccio as the betrayer of his country was\r\nrepeated with indignation and hatred.\r\n\r\nThere was one gentle heart in Florence which felt deep pain, when it\r\nheard the name of Antelminelli coupled with an opprobrious epithet.\r\nEuthanasia dei Adimari had not forgotten her vow made many years before;\r\nshe had treasured in her memory the recollection of her young\r\nplayfellow, and often, when travellers from Lombardy mentioned the name\r\nof Castruccio, her fair cheek was suffused by the eloquent blood.\r\n\r\nEuthanasia had long been an orphan; her father had died, and by his\r\ndeath was cut the dearest tie she had to earth. While he lived, she had\r\nconfined herself almost entirely to his room, and serving as eyes to his\r\nblinded sense, she was as faithful to his wants as his own orbs had been\r\nbefore their light was quenched. After his death she mingled more with\r\nthe distinguished youth of Florence, and joined in that society, which,\r\nif we may judge from the indications that Dante gives in his prose\r\nworks, and from the tender and exquisite poetry of Petrarch, was as\r\nrefined, delicate and cultivated, as the best society amidst the boasted\r\npoliteness of the present day. Yet among the youth of Florence\r\nEuthanasia was as a lily, that overlooks the less illustrious yet\r\nbeautiful flowers Of a garden. Her beauty, her accomplishments, and the\r\ngift of flowing yet mild eloquence that she possessed, the glowing\r\nbrilliancy of her ardent yet tempered imagination, made her the leader\r\nof the little band to which she belonged. It is said, that as Dante\r\nsighed for Beatrice, so several of the distinguished youths of Florence\r\nfed on the graceful motions and sweet words of this celestial girl, who,\r\nwalking among them, passionless, yet full of enthusiasm, seemed as a\r\nlink to bind their earthly thoughts to heaven. Often with her mother's\r\npermission Euthanasia retired for months to the castle of Valperga; and\r\nalone among the wild Apennines she studied and worshipped nature, while\r\nthe bright sun warmed the valleys, and threw its beams over the\r\nmountains, or when the silver boat of the moon, which displayed in the\r\nclear air its heavy lading, sunk swiftly in the west, and numberless\r\nstars witnessed her departure. Then again, quitting the eternal,\r\never-succeeding pages of nature's volume, she pored over the works she\r\nhad before read with her father, or the later written poetry of Dante,\r\nand incorporated the thoughts of the sublimest geniuses with her own,\r\nwhile the creative fire in her heart and brain formed new combinations\r\nto delight and occupy her.\r\n\r\nHer young friends hailed with heartfelt joy her return from her\r\nseclusion; she joined in all their amusements; who could sing the\r\n_canzones_ of those times, or relate a pathetic tale, like Euthanasia?\r\nBesides she was so prudent, so wise, and so kind, that her assistance\r\nwas perpetually claimed and afforded in every little misfortune or\r\ndifficulty of her friends.\r\n\r\nBut the age of thoughtlessness and fearless enjoyment passed away, and\r\nEuthanasia advanced to womanhood. At this period a succession of events\r\ndeprived her of her mother and her two brothers, so that she remained\r\nsole heiress of the possessions of her family. Independent and powerful,\r\nshe was as a queen in Valperga and the surrounding villages; at Florence\r\nshe was considered one of its first citizens; and, if power, wealth and\r\nrespect could have satisfied her, she must have been happy. She had wept\r\nbitterly the death of her relations; she grieved for the loss of her\r\nbrothers, and felt only pain at being advanced to their place. Yet her\r\nmind acquired new dignity, and the virtues of her heart new fervour,\r\nfrom the entire independence of her situation, and the opportunities she\r\npossessed of doing good. There was none to gainsay her actions, except\r\nthe rigid censorship of her own reason, and the opinion of her\r\nfellow-citizens, to whose love and esteem she aspired. Most of her time\r\nwas now spent among her dependents at Valperga; the villages under her\r\njurisdiction became prosperous; and the peasantry were proud that their\r\ncountess preferred her residence among them to the gaieties of Florence.\r\nIn the winter she visited her friends of that town; and many a noble,\r\nwho hoped to rival Dante Alighieri or Guido Cavalcanti, sang of the\r\nmiraculous change of seasons that had been operated on his city;--that\r\ntheir summers were dreary, bare, and deserted, while the soul of\r\nloveliness dwelt among them during the formerly dull months of winter.\r\n\r\nIt is said that during this period she had never loved; she admired the\r\nillustrious and energetic spirits of Florence, and she bestowed her\r\naffections on several whose virtue and talents claimed by right that\r\nmeed; but she had never loved. It appears wonderful, that one so\r\nsensitive of heart and imagination should have attained her\r\ntwenty-second year without having experienced the tyranny of that\r\npassion; but, if it be true, how tremendous must be the force of that\r\npower, which could finally break down the barriers piled by reason and\r\naccustomed coldness, and deluge her soul with the sweet waters of\r\nearthly love?\r\n\r\nShe had just entered her twenty-second year, when Castruccio in 1314\r\nreturned to Lucca; when under his auspices, the greatest enemy of\r\nFlorence became master of the neighbour city; when war was declared\r\nbetween the two states, and Castruccio was in arms against the\r\nFlorentines. The summer was now far advanced; and she hastened to her\r\nsolitude at Valperga. She was hurt at heart; one of her dearest dreams,\r\nthe excellence of Castruccio, was overthrown; and she wished for a while\r\nto shut out from her thoughts all memory of the world, which appeared to\r\nbring tumult and discord to trouble her tranquillity. She was unable to\r\ndo this: she was too well known, and too much loved, not to be sought by\r\nthose with whom she was acquainted; and she was startled to hear from\r\nall sides eulogiums of the talents and soldiership of Castruccio, those\r\nof the Ghibelines mingled with hope, those of the Guelphs with fear.\r\n\r\nIs there not a principle in the human mind that foresees the change\r\nabout to occur to it? Is there not a feeling which would warn the soul\r\nof peril, were it not at the same time a sure prophecy that that peril\r\nis not to be avoided? So felt Euthanasia: and during her evening\r\nmeditations she often enquired from her own heart, why the name of\r\nCastruccio made her cheeks glow; and why praise or dispraise of him\r\nseemed to electrify her frame: why a nameless inquietude pervaded her\r\nthoughts, before so calm: why, tenderly as she dwelt on the recollection\r\nof her infant playmate, she dreaded so much now to see him? And then,\r\nstrange to say, being thus agitated and fearful, she saw him; and a calm\r\nmore still than the serene depths of a windless heaven, redescended on\r\nher soul, and wrapt it in security and joy.\r\n\r\nIt was not until October, while Euthanasia still lingered at Valperga,\r\nthat Castruccio took up his abode in Lucca. He returned thither, covered\r\nwith glory, but highly discontented with Uguccione who feared him, and,\r\nwhile he shewed him outward honour, took every occasion to thwart his\r\ndesires, and to deprive him of all power and voice in his council. But\r\nCastruccio was at the head of a large party, who could ill brook the\r\nrude arrogance of Uguccione, and the unmasked presumption of his sons.\r\nThis party augmented every day; it was watched, insulted, and harassed;\r\nbut all the Ghibeline youth of Lucca made it their boast to attend the\r\nperson, and partake the counsels of Castruccio.\r\n\r\nThe winter months were spent in apparent idleness, but in reality in\r\ndeep plotting on the part of Castruccio. Uguccione was at Pisa, and his\r\nson, Francesco, could ill understand the wiles of the pupil of Alberto\r\nScoto. He saw his frank countenance, and watched his gay demeanour; but\r\nthe conclusion of his observations was, that although Castruccio was\r\ncareless of danger, and ambitious of glory, he was too fond of pleasure,\r\nand of too ingenuous a disposition, to enter into any deep scheme, or to\r\nform even the wish of usurping the power of the state.\r\n\r\nCastruccio stood on the tower of the Antelminelli palace; young Arrigo\r\nGuinigi was at his side; he was surrounded by half a dozen of his most\r\nintimate associates, and after having for a while discussed their plans\r\nof political conduct, they remained silent. Castruccio was separated\r\nfrom the rest of the group; the tower of Antelminelli overlooked the\r\ntown of Lucca, and being raised far above its narrow, dark streets,\r\nappeared, together with the numerous towers of the city, as forming a\r\nseparate and more agreeable town for the nobles over the heads of the\r\nmeaner inhabitants. The valley was stretched around the city; its field\r\nbare of vegetation, and spotted with black patches of leafless woods;\r\nand the view was terminated by the hills, crowned with snow, and their\r\nsides clothed with the dark verdure of the ilex, while from among their\r\nfolds peeped the white walls of villages and castles.\r\n\r\nCastruccio fixed his eye on one of these castles. The forgotten scenes\r\nof his youth thronged into his memory, and oppressed him with their\r\nnumbers and life; the low voice of his mother sounded in his ears; the\r\nvenerable form of Adimari stood before him, and it seemed to him as if\r\nthe slender fingers of the infant Euthanasia pressed his hand. He turned\r\nsuddenly round, and asked: \"Doe she still live there?\"--pointing to the\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\n\"Who? The countess of Valperga?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, and her daughter Euthanasia?\" Many years had elapsed since he had\r\npronounced that name; he felt his whole frame thrill to its musical\r\nsound.\r\n\r\n\"The present countess,\" replied Vanni Mordecastelli, \"is young and\r\nunmarried\"--\r\n\r\n\"And her name is Euthanasia,\" continued count Ludovico de' Fondi; \"she\r\nis the daughter of Messer Antonio dei Adimari, who while he lived was\r\none of the leaders of the Guelph party at Florence; and through her\r\nmother she possesses the castle and villages of Valperga.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye,\" cried a youth, \"and they say that Ranieri della Fagginola\r\npretends to Her hand. It is not well, that the credulity of a woman, who\r\nwill listen to the first fine speeches that are addressed to her, should\r\ncause so strong a hold as the castle of Valperga to pass into the hands\r\nof that insufferable nest of traitors.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are ignorant of whom you talk,\" said the aged Fondi, \"when you\r\nspeak thus lightly of the young countess of Valperga. She is a lady of\r\ngreat prudence, beauty, and learning; and, although for years she has\r\nbeen sought by the first nobles of Italy, she glories in her\r\nindependence and solitude. She mingles little with the citizens of this\r\ntown; her friends reside at Florence, where she often passes many\r\nmonths, associating with its first families.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she as beautiful, as she is said to be?\" asked young Arrigo Guinigi.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed she is lovely to a miracle; but her manners almost make you\r\nforget her beauty; they are so winning and graceful. Unfortunately she\r\ndoes not belong to our party, but is as strongly attached to the Pope's\r\nas the countess Matilda of old.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, these women are so easily cajoled by priests.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, Moncello, you will still be in the wrong, if you apply common\r\nrules to the conduct of the countess Euthanasia. She is attached to the\r\ncause of the freedom of Florence, and not to the power of her Popes.\r\nWhen I visited her on her return to her castle, I found her full of\r\ngrief at the renewal of the war between these states. She earnestly\r\nasked me whether I saw any prospect of peace; 'For,' said she, 'I am\r\nmore attached to concord and the alliance of parties, than to any of the\r\nfactions which distract our poor Italy.'\"----\r\n\r\nThe conversation then turned on other subjects. Castruccio had listened\r\nsilently to the praise which the old count Fondi had bestowed on the\r\nfriend of his childhood; and presently after, taking Arrigo aside, he\r\nsaid: \"My young friend, you must go on an embassy for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the end of the world, if you desire it, my dear lord\"--\r\n\r\n\"Nay, this is a shorter journey. You must ride to-morrow morning to the\r\ncastle of Valperga, and ask permission of the countess that I may visit\r\nher. Our families, though of opposite interests, were much allied; and I\r\nought to have sought this interview before.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day Castruccio waited anxiously for the return of\r\nArrigo. He arrived a little before noon. \"I have seen her,\" he cried;\r\n\"and, after having seen her, I wonder at the torpor of these Lucchese\r\nthat they do not all emigrate from their town, to go and surround her\r\ncastle, and gaze on her all day long. I seem only to live since I have\r\nseen her; she is so lovely, so enchantingly kind and gentle. I have\r\nheard you say, my good brother, that you never met with a woman whom you\r\ncould enshrine in your inmost heart, and thus pay worship to the exalted\r\nspirit of loveliness, which you had vainly sought, and never found. Go\r\nto Valperga, and, gazing on Euthanasia, you will tremblingly unread your\r\nheresy.\"\r\n\r\n\"To horse then, my dear Arrigo. Does she consent to receive me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she desires to see you; and with the most ingenuous sweetness, she\r\nbade me tell you the pleasure it would give her, to renew her\r\nacquaintance with one whom she has not forgotten during a long\r\nseparation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\n_Castle of Valperga described--Friendship\r\nand Love._\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This is a well known road to me,\" thought Castruccio, as he rode across\r\nthe plain of Lucca towards the hills of the Baths; \"there is still that\r\nmountain, that as a craggy and mighty wall surmounts and bounds the\r\nother Apennines; the lower peaks are still congregated round it,\r\nattracting and arresting the clouds that pause on their summits, and\r\nthen slowly roll off. What a splendid garb of snow these old mountains\r\nhave thrown over themselves, to shield them from the _tramontano_[3],\r\nthat buffets them all the winter long, while their black sides appear\r\nalmost as the shadows of a marble statue. Looking at these hills, it\r\nseems to me as if I had suddenly a recollection of a previous existence,\r\nsuch a crowd of ideas rush upon me, the birth of my early years, long\r\ndead, now revived. There on that hill stands the old sheep-cot, in which\r\nI once took refuge during a storm; there is the castle of the Fondi,\r\nnear which grow the largest ilexes of these hills; and in that recess of\r\nthe mountain is the holy spring, near which on summer mornings\r\nEuthanasia and I have often gathered flowers, and placed leaves for\r\nboats, seeing them swallowed up and again cast forth in the whirl of\r\nthat strange pool; I wonder if that tall cypress still throws its shade\r\nupon the water; methinks it would well please me, to sit as of yore,\r\nEuthanasia by my side, on its moss-covered roots.\"\r\n\r\nCastruccio's heart was much softened, as he successively recognized\r\nobjects, which he had forgotten for so many years, and with which he had\r\nbeen most intimately acquainted. The peculiar form of the branches of a\r\ntree, the winding of an often-trod mountain-path, the murmurs of small\r\nstreams, their banks bedecked with dwarf shrubs; things which would have\r\nappeared uncharacterized to one who viewed them for the first time; bore\r\nfor him some distinguishing mark, some peculiar shape, which awoke\r\nwithin him memories that had been long laid asleep.\r\n\r\nThe road that led from Lucca to Valperga struck directly across the\r\nplain to the foot of the rock on which the castle was built. This rock\r\noverhung the road, casting a deep shade; and projected, forming a\r\nprecipice on three sides; the northern side, at the foot of which the\r\nSecchio flowed, was disjoined from the mountain by a ravine, and a\r\ntorrent struggled in the depth, among loose stones, and the gnarled and\r\nnaked roots of trees that shaded the side of the cleft. Castruccio began\r\nto ascend the path which led to the portal of the castle, that was cut\r\nin the precipitous side of this recess, and was bordered by hedges of\r\nstunted myrtles overtopped by chesnut trees; the foliage of these had\r\nfallen; and their spoils, yellow, and brown, and red, were strewed on\r\nthe shining leaves of the myrtle underwood. The path was steep,\r\nserpentine and narrow; so that Castruccio, who now looked on nature with\r\na soldier's eye, remarked what an excellent defence Valperga might make,\r\nif that were the only access to it: the torrent roared below, keeping\r\nthe air for ever awake; for that commoner babbles more and louder among\r\nhuge mountains, and solitudes which may never be still, than among the\r\nhaunts of men; but all sounds are melodious there; none harsh and\r\nobtrusive.\r\n\r\nAt the summit of the path was a drawbridge that connected it with the\r\nalmost isolated platform of rock on which the castle stood:--the\r\nbuilding nearly covered this space, leaving room only for a small plot\r\nof ground, which overlooked the plain, and was guarded by a barbican;\r\nand on which a few trees, dark ilexes, and light acacias, mingled their\r\ncontrasted foliage. Behind the castle the mountain rose, barren and\r\nnearly perpendicular; and, when you looked up, the dark and\r\nweather-stained precipice towered above, while the blue sky seemed to\r\nrest upon it. The castle itself was a large and picturesque building,\r\nturreted, and gracefully shaded by trees. Castruccio entered the gate on\r\nthe side of the drawbridge, and passed between the main building and the\r\nbarbican which guarded the pass; so coming round to the front of the\r\ncastle, which opened on the grassy plot; here he was met by several\r\nservants, and conducted to the apartment of Euthanasia. The counts of\r\nValperga had been rich; and the castle was more magnificent than those\r\nrocky strong holds usually were. The great banqueting hall was painted\r\nwith various figures, which, though rude, and defective in shade and\r\nperspective, were regarded with admiration in those days. A large\r\nfireplace, now illumined by a blazing fire, gave an air of cheerfulness\r\nto the hall; several serving-men, and two large and beautiful dogs, were\r\ncowering round the fire, as a cold January blast rushed through the\r\nopposite door, through which Castruccio passed into an inner, open court\r\nof the castle.\r\n\r\nThis court was surrounded by gothic cloisters on all sides except one,\r\nwhere the huge mountain formed the barrier: high, near the summit of the\r\nrock, grew a few cypresses; and, as you gazed upwards at them, they\r\nseemed to pierce the sky with their dark and motionless spires. On one\r\nside of this court was a handsome staircase built of the marble of\r\nCarrara, and by this he ascended into the audience chamber. It was then,\r\nbeing winter, hung with scarlet cloth; the ceiling was painted; and the\r\nbright marble pavement reflected in dim colours the Venus and her Cupids\r\ndepicted above. A small tripod of white marble curiously carved, stood\r\nin the middle of the room, supporting a bronze censer in which incense\r\nwas burning; several antique vases and tripods adorned the room; the\r\ntables were of the finest stones, or of glass mosaic; and the seats or\r\ncouches were covered with scarlet cloth inwoven with gold. Within this\r\nwas Euthanasia's own apartment; it was hung with blue silk, and the\r\npavement was of mosaic; the couches were richly embroidered, and a small\r\ntable of _verde antique_ stood in the middle of the room. In the\r\nrecesses were several stands for books, writing materials, etc.; and in\r\nthe embrasures of the windows were bronze stands, on which were placed\r\nfinely embossed gold vases, filled with such flowers as the season\r\nafforded. But, amidst all this luxury, the richest ornament of the room\r\nwas the lovely possessor herself.\r\n\r\nCastruccio and Euthanasia met; after many years of absence, they gazed\r\non each other with curiosity and interest. Euthanasia had awaited his\r\narrival with unwonted anxiety: she could not explain to herself the\r\nagitation that she felt at the idea of meeting him; but, when she saw\r\nhim, beautiful as a god, power and love dwelling on every feature of his\r\ncountenance, and in every motion of his graceful form, the unquiet\r\nbeatings of her heart ceased, and she became calm and happy. And was she\r\nnot also beautiful? Her form was light, and every limb was shaped\r\naccording to those rules by which the exquisite statues of the antients\r\nhave been modelled. A quantity of golden hair fell round her neck, and,\r\nunless it had been confined by a veil that was wreathed round her head,\r\nit would almost have touched the ground; her eyes were blue; a blue that\r\nseemed to have drunk-in the depths of an Italian sky, and to reflect\r\nfrom their orbs the pure and unfathomable brilliance, which strikes the\r\nsight as darkness, of a Roman heaven; but these beauteous eyes were\r\nfringed by long, pointed lashes, which softened their fire, and added to\r\ntheir sweetness: the very soul of open-hearted Charity dwelt on her\r\nbrow, and her lips expressed the softest sensibility; there was in her\r\ncountenance, beyond all of kind and good that you could there discover,\r\nan expression that seemed to require ages to read and understand; a\r\nwisdom exalted by enthusiasm, a wildness tempered by self-command, that\r\nfilled every look and every motion with eternal change. She was dressed\r\naccording to the custom of the times, yet her dress was rather plain,\r\nbeing neither ornamented with gold nor jewels; a silk vest of blue\r\nreached from her neck to her feet, girded at the waist by a small\r\nembroidered band; the wide and, hanging sleeves were embroidered at the\r\nedge, and fell far over her hands, except when, thrown back, they\r\ndiscovered her rosy-tipt fingers and taper wrist.\r\n\r\nThey met then and often again; and the difference of their political\r\nparties only drew them closer. Euthanasia perceived that Castruccio\r\nintended to work some change in the state of her country; and she\r\nearnestly wished,--not to draw him over to her party,--but to shew how\r\nfutile that distinction and enmity were, if one love of peace and good\r\nanimated all hearts. She wished also to read his mind, to know if the\r\nlove of liberty lived there. Euthanasia had this foible, if indeed it\r\nmight be called one in her, to love the very shadow of freedom with\r\nunbounded enthusiasm. She was bred a Guelph among the leaders of that\r\nparty at Florence, a party whose watchword was liberty; her rank itself\r\nwould have forced her to take part in the contentions of the times; but\r\nshe was no narrow partizan; her father, and the studies she had followed\r\nunder him, had taught her higher lessons; and the history of the Roman\r\nrepublic had increased her love of freedom, while it had annihilated in\r\nher mind all interest in petty intrigue. Castruccio was a staunch\r\nGhibeline, and his soul was set on the advancement of that party; he did\r\nnot sympathize with Euthanasia, but he appeared to do so, for he loved\r\nher, and listened, his eyes shining with pleasure, while she spoke in\r\nsilver tones, and all appeared wise and good that came from her lips.\r\nOften her gentle eloquence would for a while carry him along with it,\r\nand he would talk of republics, and the energy and virtue that every\r\ncitizen acquires, when each, acting under the censure of each, yet\r\npossesses power; and men, not as children obedient to the mere word of\r\ncommand, discuss and regulate their own interests. Her admiration for\r\nthe character of several of the Florentine chiefs gave interest to her\r\ndetails respecting the changes that had occurred there during the last\r\nyears, and to the many anecdotes that she dwelt upon as demonstrating\r\nthe power and grandeur of her beloved Florence.\r\n\r\nNor were their conversations only political. Euthanasia's mind was\r\nstored with sweet lore; she loved poetry, and sang or repeated the\r\nverses of Guido or Dante; and, as she made excursions among the woods,\r\nor joined in hunting-parties with Castruccio and her other friends, her\r\nconversation appeared one strain of poetry. Castruccio related his\r\nadventures, and Euthanasia was never weary of listening to the details\r\nof the English and French courts and manners; two systems of society, so\r\nwidely opposite to each other, and both so different from the scenes to\r\nwhich she had been accustomed. Their love for one another, and their\r\nconfidence increased: the winter months passed on, and the first days of\r\nspring, bringing with them green leaves and soft air, found them vowed\r\nfriends, each believing to be knit to the other for life with the\r\nstrongest ties of enduring love.\r\n\r\nEuthanasia said that she loved for the first time, and a falsehood had\r\nnever stained her purest soul; a well of intensest and overflowing\r\npassion was opened in her heart; every feeling was softened, every\r\nemotion modulated by this change: she was penetrated with love; and,\r\nadmiration and esteem forming but a part of this, she made a god of him\r\nshe loved, believing every virtue and every talent to live in his soul.\r\nThus, unrestrained by any latent fear or ungenerous suspicion, she gave\r\nup her heart to him, and was for a while happy. They passed much time\r\ntogether; and every day each made a discovery of some new excellence,\r\nsome till then unobserved accomplishment.\r\n\r\nHer feelings were indeed entirely changed by the birth of this new and\r\npowerful sentiment. Hitherto she had been in a great degree alone in the\r\nworld; finding none who entirely sympathized with her, she had poured\r\nout the treasure of her heart to the ear of silence alone. She was happy\r\namong the gaieties of Florence; the wit and imagination of the people\r\nformed an agreeable variety to her life; but there was a mutable and\r\nchangeful spirit among them, that did not invite her confidence. Her\r\neyes had often been lighted up, and her spirit awakened in conversation,\r\nwhere wit sharpens wit, and the ideas of one mind seem to cause the\r\nbirth of the children of another. But, when tenderness softened her\r\nheart, and the sublime feeling of universal love penetrated her, she\r\nfound no voice that replied so well to hers as the gentle singing of the\r\npines under the air of noon, and the soft murmurs of the breeze that\r\nscattered her hair and freshened her cheek, and the dashing of the\r\nwaters that has no beginning or end.\r\n\r\nIt was not thus now; the words and looks of Castruccio replied to her,\r\nand she felt happier than she had ever been. There was no doubt, no\r\nsorrow; all was security and calm; and her heart softened, until tears\r\nsprang forth under the weight of unmitigated pleasure. She was frank,\r\ngenerous and fearless; therefore she instantly believed and trusted;\r\nwhile the master-passions which ever ruled her life were not forgotten,\r\nbut, mingling with and heightened by love, glowed with greater energy.\r\nThey passed several months in the enjoyment of this intercourse; they\r\nhoped, they felt, that their destinies were intertwined never to be\r\nseparated; and their union was only deferred until Castruccio should\r\nfree his country. The summer advancing would soon give the signal for\r\nseparation. On one of these days, one of the last before their parting,\r\nEuthanasia related to Castruccio the few events of her peaceful life\r\nwhich had occurred since their separation ten years before. The tale was\r\nshort, but it was one that deeply interested the listener.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The _Tramontano_ is the north wind; the _Scirocco_ the\r\nsouth-west and the _Libeccio_ the south-east.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\n_Euthanasia's Narrative._\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is strange for one to speak, who never before has uttered the\r\nsentiments of her heart. With my eyes I have spoken to the starry skies\r\nand the green earth; and with smiles that could not express my emotion I\r\nhave conversed with the soft airs of summer, the murmur of streams, and\r\nthe chequered shades of our divine woods: but never before have I\r\nawakened sympathy in a human countenance with words that unlock the\r\ntreasure of my heart.\r\n\r\n\"I have lived a solitary hermitess, and have become an enthusiast for\r\nall beauty. Being alone, I have not feared to give the reins to my\r\nfeelings; I have lived happily within the universe of my own mind, and\r\nhave often given reality to that which others call a dream. I have had\r\nfew hopes, and few fears; but every passing sentiment has been an event;\r\nand I have marked the birth of a new idea with the joy that others\r\nderive from what they call change and fortune. What is the world, except\r\nthat which we feel? Love, and hope, and delight, or sorrow and tears;\r\nthese are our lives, our realities, to which we give the names of power,\r\npossession, misfortune, and death.\r\n\r\n\"You smile at my strange words. I now feel livelier emotions arise; and,\r\nas is my custom, I try to define and understand them. Love, when\r\nnurtured by sympathy, is a stronger feeling, than those breathless\r\nemotions which arise from the contemplation of what is commonly called\r\ninanimate nature, and of the wondrous and eternal changes of the\r\nuniverse; and, feeling as I do, that if I give it place in my heart, it\r\nmust bear my whole being away with it, as the tempest bears the rack\r\nalong the sky, wonder not, dear friend, that I have paused, and even\r\nshuddered, when I thought that an unknown power was about to dwell in my\r\nsoul, which might make it blind to its former delights, and deaf to the\r\ndeep voice of that nature, whose child and nursling I call myself. But\r\nnow I doubt no more; I am yours, Castruccio; be my fortune tearful or\r\nsmiling, it shall be one that will bring with it human sympathy, and I\r\nresign that savage liberty of which I was ere while jealous.\r\n\r\n\"You have asked me to relate the events of my life; I may say that it is\r\na blank, if you would not hear the history of many a strange idea, many\r\nan exalted feeling, and reverie of wondrous change. You left me at\r\nFlorence the favourite daughter of a father I adored: I was ever near\r\nhim reading and conversing with him; and if I have put order in my day\r\ndreams, and culled the fruit of virtue and some slight wisdom from my\r\nmeditations, it is to his lessons that I owe this good. It is he who\r\ntaught me to fathom my sensations, and discipline my mind; to understand\r\nwhat my feelings were, and whether they arose from a good or evil\r\nsource. He taught me to look on my own faults fearlessly; humbly as a\r\nweak being--yet not with mock humility, but with a modest, yet firm\r\ncourage, that led me to know what indeed I might become. He explained to\r\nme the lessons of our divine master; which our priests corrupt to\r\nsatisfy the most groveling desires; and he taught me to seek in\r\nself-approbation, and in a repentance, which was that of virtuous\r\naction, and not of weeping, for the absolution of which they make a\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\n\"Do I speak with vanity? I hope that you do not so far mistake me. I\r\nhave been a solitary being; and, conversing with my own heart, I have\r\nbeen so accustomed to use the frank language of a knowledge drawn from\r\nfixed principles, and to weigh my actions and thoughts in those scales\r\nwhich my reason and my religion afforded me, that my words may sound\r\nvain; when they are only true. I do not think then that I could speak\r\nwith vanity; for I was enumerating the benefits that I received from my\r\nfather. I read with him the literature of ancient Rome; and my whole\r\nsoul was filled with the beauty of action, and the poetic sentiment of\r\nthese writers. At first I complained that no men lived now, who bore\r\naffinity to these far shining beacons of the earth: but my father\r\nconvinced me, that the world was shaking off her barbaric lethargy, and\r\nthat Florence, in her struggle for freedom, had awakened the noblest\r\nenergies of the human mind. Once, when we attended a court in Lombardy,\r\na minstrel sang some of the Cantos of Dante's _Divina Comedia_, and I\r\ncan never forget the enthusiastic joy I experienced, in finding that I\r\nwas the contemporary of its illustrious author.\r\n\r\n\"I endeavour to mark in this little history of myself the use of the\r\nvarious feelings that rule all my actions; and I must date my enthusiasm\r\nfor the liberties of my country, and the political welfare of Italy,\r\nfrom the repetition of these Cantos of Dante's poem. The Romans, whose\r\nwritings I adored, were free; a Greek who once visited us, had related\r\nto us what treasures of poetry and wisdom existed in his language, and\r\nthese were the productions of freemen: the mental history of the rest of\r\nthe world who are slaves, was a blank, and thus I was irresistibly\r\nforced to connect wisdom and liberty together; and, as I worshipped\r\nwisdom as the pure emanation of the Deity, the divine light of the\r\nworld, so did I adore liberty as its parent, its sister, the half of its\r\nbeing. Florence was free, and Dante was a Florentine; none but a freeman\r\ncould have poured forth the poetry and eloquence to which I listened:\r\nwhat though he were banished from his native city, and had espoused a\r\nparty that seemed to support tyranny; the essence of freedom is that\r\nclash and struggle which awaken the energies of our nature, and that\r\noperation of the elements of our mind, which as it were gives us the\r\nforce and power that hinder us from degenerating, as they say all things\r\nearthly do when not regenerated by change.\r\n\r\n\"What is man without wisdom? And what would not this world become, if\r\nevery man might learn from its institutions the true principles of life,\r\nand become as the few which have as yet shone as stars amidst the night\r\nof ages? If time had not shaken the light of poetry and of genius from\r\nhis wings, all the past would be dark and trackless: now we have a\r\ntrack--the glorious foot-marks of the children of liberty; let us\r\nimitate them, and like them we may serve as marks in the desart, to\r\nattract future passengers to the fountains of life. Already we have\r\nbegun to do so; and Dante is the pledge of a glorious race, which tells\r\nus that, in clinging to the freedom which gave birth to his genius, we\r\nmay awake the fallen hopes of the world. These sentiments, nurtured and\r\ndirected by my father, have caused the growth of an enthusiasm in my\r\nsoul, which can only die when I die.\r\n\r\n\"I was at this time but sixteen; and at that age, unless I had been\r\nguided by the lessons of my father, my meditations would have been\r\nsufficiently fruitless. But he, whether he taught me to consider the\r\nworld and the community of man, or to study the little universe of my\r\nown mind, was wisdom's self, pouring out accents that commanded\r\nattention and obedience. At first I believed, that my heart was good,\r\nand that by following its dictates I should not do wrong; I was proud,\r\nand loved not to constrain my will, though I myself were the mistress;\r\nbut he told me, that either my judgement or passions must rule me, and\r\nthat my future happiness and usefulness depended on the choice I made\r\nbetween these two laws. I learned from him to look upon events as being\r\nof consequence only through the feelings which they excited, and to\r\nbelieve that content of mind, love, and benevolent feeling ought to be\r\nthe elements of our existence; while those accidents of fortune or fame,\r\nwhich to the majority make up the sum of their existence, were as the\r\ndust of the balance.\r\n\r\n\"Well; these were the lessons of my father, a honey of wisdom on which I\r\nfed until I attained my eighteenth year; and then he died. What I felt,\r\nmy grief and despair, I will not relate; few sorrows surpass that of a\r\nchild, who loses a beloved parent before she has formed new ties which\r\nhave weakened the first and the most religious.\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember my mother? She was a lady with a kind heart, and a\r\nhumanity and equanimity of temper few could surpass. She was a Guelph, a\r\nviolent partizan, and, heart and soul, was taken up with treaties of\r\npeace, acquisitions in war, the conduct of allies, and the fortune of\r\nher enemies: while she talked to you, you would have thought that the\r\nwhole globe of the earth was merely an appendage to the county of\r\nValperga. She was acquainted with all the magistrates of Florence, the\r\nprobabilities of elections, the state of the troops, the receipt of\r\nimposts, and every circumstance of the republic. She was interested in\r\nthe most lively manner in the fall of Corso Donati[4], the war with\r\nPistoia, the taking of that town, and the deaths and elections of the\r\nvarious Popes. She was present at every court held by the Guelph lords\r\nof Lombardy; and her poor subjects were sometimes rather hardly taxed,\r\nthat we might appear with suitable dignity on these occasions. The\r\nmarriage of her children was her next care; but she could never come to\r\na decisive resolve as to which alliance would be the most advantageous\r\nto her family, and at the same time most promote the cause of the\r\nGuelphs in Italy.\r\n\r\n\"When my father died, she sent for my eldest brother from Naples; and\r\nfor several months her mind was occupied by his accession, and the\r\ndignity that the houses of Adimari and Valperga would acquire by having\r\na young warrior at their head, instead of a woman and a blind\r\nphilosopher. My brother was a soldier, a brave man, full of ambition and\r\nparty spirit; and a new field was opened to my mother's politics by him,\r\nwhen he detailed the intrigues of the Neapolitan court; she was for ever\r\noccupied in sending messengers, receiving dispatches, calculating\r\nimposts, and all the pygmy acts of a petty state.\r\n\r\n\"When I was nineteen years of age, we heard that my younger brother had\r\nfallen ill at Rome, and desired to see some one of his family. My uncle,\r\nthe abbot of St. Maurice, was on the point of going to Rome; and I\r\nobtained my mother's leave to accompany him. Oh, what long draughts of\r\njoy I drank in on that journey! I did not think that my brother's\r\nillness was dangerous, and indeed considered that circumstance more as\r\nthe pretext, than the object of my journey; so I fearlessly gave myself\r\nup to the enthusiasm that deluged my soul. Expression lags, as then my\r\nown spirit flagged, beneath the influence of these thoughts: it was to\r\nRome I journied, to see the vestiges of the mistress of the world,\r\nwithin whose walls all I could conceive of great, and good, and wise,\r\nhad breathed and acted: I should draw in the sacred air which had\r\nvivified the heroes of Rome; their shades would surround me; and the\r\nvery stones that I should tread were marked by their footsteps. Can you\r\nconceive what I felt? You have not studied the histories of ancient\r\ntimes, and perhaps know not the life that breathes in them; a soul of\r\nbeauty and wisdom which had penetrated my heart of hearts. When I\r\ndescended the hills of the Abruzzi, and first saw the Tiber rolling its\r\ntranquil waters glistening under the morning sun; I wept;--why did not\r\nCato live?--why was I not going to see her consuls, her heroes, and her\r\npoets? Alas! I was about to approach the shadow of Rome, the inanimate\r\ncorse, the broken image of what was once great beyond all power of\r\nspeech to express. My enthusiasm again changed; and I felt a kind of\r\nsacred horror run through my veins. Thou, oh! Tiber, ever rollest, ever\r\nand for ever the same! yet are not thy waters those which flowed here\r\nwhen the Scipios and the Fabii lived on thy shores; the grass and the\r\nherbage which adorn thy banks have many thousand times been renewed\r\nsince it was pressed on by their feet; all is changed, even thou art not\r\nthe same!\r\n\r\n\"It was night when we entered Rome; I dared hardly breathe; the stars\r\nshone bright in the deep azure of heaven; and with their twinkling beams\r\nilluminated the dark towers which were black and silent, seeming like\r\nanimated beings asleep. A procession of monks passed by chaunting in a\r\nsweet and solemn tone, in that language which once awoke the pauses of\r\nthis Roman air with words of fire. Methought they sang their city's\r\n_requiem;_ methought I was following to their last narrow home all that\r\nhad existed of great and good in this god-inhabited city.\r\n\r\n\"I remained in Rome three months; when I arrived, my brother was\r\nconsiderably better, and we entertained every hope of his recovery. I\r\nspent my life among the ruins of Rome; and I felt, as I was told that I\r\nappeared to be, rather a wandering shade of the ancient times, than a\r\nmodern Italian. In my wild enthusiasm I called on the shadows of the\r\ndeparted to converse with me, and to prophesy the fortunes of awakening\r\nItaly. I can never forget one evening that I visited the Pantheon by\r\nmoonlight: the soft beams of the planet streamed through its open roof,\r\nand its tall pillars glimmered around. It seemed as if the spirit of\r\nbeauty descended on my soul, as I sat there in mute extacy; never had I\r\nbefore so felt the universal graspings of my own mind, or the sure\r\ntokens of other spiritual existences, as at that moment. Oh! could I\r\neven now pour forth in words the sentiments of love, and virtue, and\r\ndivinest wisdom, that then burst in upon my soul, in a rich\r\ntorrent----such as was the light of the moon to the dark temple in which\r\nI stood--the whole world would stand and listen: but fainter than the\r\nmoon-beams and more evanescent are those deep thoughts; my eyes glisten,\r\nmy cheeks glow, but words are denied me. I feel as it were my own soul\r\nat work within me, and surely, if I could disclose its secret\r\noperations, and lay bare the vitals of my being, in that moment, which\r\nwould be one of overwhelming extacy--in that moment I should die.\r\n\r\n\"Well; to return to the events that sealed my residence in Rome, and by\r\nshedding the softness of affectionate sorrow over my feelings, added to\r\ntheir deep holiness. The last month of my residence there, I was a\r\nconstant attendant on the sick bed of my dying brother: he did not\r\nsuffer pain; his illness was lethargic; and I watched with breathless\r\nanxiety the change from life to death. Sometimes, when the _Ave Maria_\r\nhad sounded, and the heats of the day had subsided, I stole out into the\r\nair to refresh my wearied spirits. There is no sky so blue as that of\r\nRome; it is deep, penetrating, and dazzling: but at this hour it had\r\nfaded, and its soft airs, that made wild and thrilling music among the\r\nsolitudes of its hills and ruins, cooled my fevered cheeks, and soothed\r\nme in spite of sorrow. I then enjoyed grief; I may now say so, although\r\nI then felt anguish alone; truly I wept, and bitterly over the illness\r\nof my brother: but, when the soul is active, it brings a certain\r\nconsolation along with it: I was never so much alive as then, when my\r\nwanderings, which seldom exceeded one or at most two hours, seemed to be\r\nlengthened into days and weeks. I loved to wander by the banks of the\r\nTiber, which were solitary, and, if the scirocco blew, to mark the\r\nclouds as they sped over St. Peter's and the many towers of Rome:\r\nsometimes I walked on the Quirinal or Pincian mounts which overlook the\r\ncity, and gazed, until my soul was elevated by poetic transport.\r\nBeautiful city, thy towers were illuminated by the orange tints of the\r\nfast-departing sunset, and the ghosts of lovely memories floated with\r\nthe night breeze, among thy ruins; I became calm; amidst a dead race,\r\nand an extinguished empire, what individual sorrow would dare raise its\r\nvoice? subdued, trembling, and overcome, I crept back to the sick bed of\r\nmy brother.\r\n\r\n\"He died; and I left this city of my soul. I know not whether I shall\r\never again breathe its air; but its memory is a burning cloud of sunset\r\nin the deep azure of the sky: it is that passage in my life since my\r\nfather's death, on which my intellectual eye rests with emotion,\r\npleasurable now, although I then endured poignant sorrow.\r\n\r\n\"The passenger that carried the intelligence of my younger brother's\r\ndeath to my mother, was crossed on the road by one who came to inform me\r\nthat the eldest also was no more. He was killed in an assault on\r\nPistoia. Thus death quickly mowed down the ranks of our family; and at\r\nlast I have become a solitary scion of the stock.\r\n\r\n\"I returned home by very slow journies, and in my way was detained a\r\nfortnight at Perugia. When I arrived, I was met by my mother at our\r\npalace in Florence; she burst into tears as she folded me in her arms,\r\nand wept for some time, lamenting with bitter grief her sad losses. I\r\nmingled my tears with hers, and alas! I soon shed them alone; doubly an\r\norphan through her death, I mourned over the last of my family. So many\r\nlosses, following swift one upon the other, astounded me; and I passed\r\nmany months, as one who had wandered from the true path, and had no\r\nguide to set her right. I retreated to my castle, and the solitude\r\nfrightened me; I returned to Florence; but the gaieties of that city\r\nonly told me more plainly that I was alone, since I sympathized with\r\nnone there. But time has healed these wounds, leaving only a tinge of\r\nmelancholy in my character which had not belonged to it till now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Dante: _Purgatorio_, Canto XXIV.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\n_Capture of Monte Catini.--Castruccio treacherously\r\nmade prisoner by Ranieri, Governor\r\nof Lucca.--Delivered, and proclaimed\r\nConsul._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter passed away, and with the summer the toils of the soldier\r\nbegan. Castruccio left Lucca, and joined the army of Uguccione against\r\nthe Florentines. He took leave of his lady; yet she neither tied the\r\nscarf around him, nor bade him go and prosper. Florence was her native\r\ntown; and love of their country was a characteristic of all Florentines.\r\nThere was in that city an energy of spirit, which panting to expand\r\nitself, sought for new emotions, or exalted those that were before felt,\r\nuntil each sentiment became a passion. The Florentines were patriots;\r\nthere was not one among them, who would not have sacrificed wealth,\r\nlife, and happiness, to the prosperity of his native city. Euthanasia\r\nwas brought up in the midst of public discussions and of expressions of\r\npublic feeling; the army of the Florentines contained her best friends,\r\nthe companions of her youth, all among men whom she had esteemed and\r\nloved; how then could she bid her lover, go, and prosper, when he went\r\nto destroy them? She would have been still more unhappy, could she have\r\nanticipated the event of the campaign.\r\n\r\nUguccione engaged himself in the siege of the castle of Monte Catini;\r\nand the Florentines, after having made every exertion to assemble and\r\ndiscipline their troops, advanced against him with a larger army than\r\nthey had ever before brought into the field. Nor were the preparations\r\nof Uguccione inferior in vigour; he assembled all his allies, and\r\nawaited with confidence the arrival of the enemy. During this interval\r\nhowever, the chief fell ill, and was obliged to retire from the camp:\r\nthe nominal command of the army devolved on his eldest son Francesco;\r\nbut all looked up to Castruccio as their real leader. The Florentines\r\nadvanced full of hope; and the Lucchese awaited them with steady\r\ncourage. The battle was long and bloody; in the beginning of the combat\r\nFrancesco was killed, and Castruccio perceived the soldiers make a\r\nsudden halt, when they saw their general fall: instantly feeling that\r\nthe command devolved upon him, he galloped to the front of the lines, he\r\nthrew off his casque that he might be distinguished, and, bidding the\r\ntrumpets sound, he led his troops to a fresh assault. His army was drawn\r\nout on the plain, and every eye was turned upwards towards the castle,\r\nwhich, situated on the height of a steep hill, was the goal they must\r\nwin. Castruccio had seen service in France; but with far different\r\nfeelings did he now engage in battle. He was surrounded by his friends;\r\nhe saw those he loved advance with a steady eye to the danger towards\r\nwhich he led them; he looked up, and saw above the high seated castle\r\nthat he must storm; be saw the closely set ranks of the enemy; he beheld\r\nall this with one glance, one feeling quicker than a look, and the\r\ntrumpets sounded while he waved his sword; his spirits were exhilarated,\r\nhis heart swelled,--tears--tears of high and uncontrolable emotion,\r\nfilled his eyes, as he dashed through the ranks of the enemy, and cried,\r\n\"Victory, or death!\" None dared disobey his voice. His dark brown hair,\r\non which the sun shone, might be distinguished amidst a forest of\r\nhostile javelins. He was wounded; but he refused to retire; and fixing\r\nhis eye on the castle walls--he cried, \"There is our home!\" All gave way\r\nbefore his fury; that part of the Florentine army which had been drawn\r\nout on the plain, was dispersed and fled--the rest retreated towards the\r\ncastle; when he saw them retreat, when he first perceived that they gave\r\nground before him, his triumph and extacy rose almost to frenzy; the\r\nmountain was steep, he threw himself from his horse, his troop followed\r\nhis example; he called on them by the names of father and brother to\r\nfollow his steps. \"Go on!\" they cried, \"go on!\" And they broke through\r\nall the impediments placed to impede their ascent, and were seen in\r\nclose array, winding up the steep path towards the castle.\r\n\r\nThe victory was due to him alone; he, ever foremost, scaled the height,\r\nand first displayed the Ghibeline banner from the walls of the castle of\r\nMonte Catini; while, his cheek pale with pain, and his limbs trembling\r\nfrom loss of blood, it seemed almost as if his own death would seal the\r\nbloody conquest. The Florentines sustained irreparable loss; their\r\ngeneral, the son of the king of Naples, several of his relations, and\r\nmany members of the noblest families in Florence, fell. The loss is\r\ncompared by the Florentine historians to the defeat of Cann\u00e6; and many\r\nyears elapsed before Florence could fill up the gap among her citizens\r\nmade by the havoc of that day.\r\n\r\nSuch was the news that blanched poor Euthanasia's cheek. She had spent\r\nthe period that had elapsed since the departure of Castruccio, in utter\r\nsolitude. Her anxiety, and the combat of feelings which she experienced,\r\ndestroyed all her peace: she dared not give her prayers to either side;\r\nor if, following the accustomed bent of her inclinations, she wished\r\nsuccess to her townsmen, the idea of Castruccio defeated, perhaps\r\nkilled, turned all her thoughts to double bitterness. Yet, when the\r\nFlorentines were indeed defeated, when messenger after messenger brought\r\nintelligence from her terror-stricken friends of the sad losses they had\r\nsustained, when the name of Castruccio as the slayer was repeated with\r\nfear and curses by those whom she tenderly loved; then indeed the\r\ncurrent of her feelings returned with violence to its accustomed\r\nchannel, and, bitterly reproaching herself for having dared to hesitate\r\nin a cause where her country was concerned, she knelt down, and solemnly\r\nand deliberately made a vow, sanctifying it by an appeal to all that she\r\nheld sacred in heaven and upon earth,--she made a deep and tremendous\r\nvow, never to ally herself to the enemy of Florence: and then, somewhat\r\ncalmed in soul, though ever sorrowing, she waited for the return of\r\nCastruccio to Lucca, so to learn if he could clear himself, or if indeed\r\nhe were that enemy to Florence against whom her vow was made.\r\n\r\nIf the overthrow and massacre of the Florentines had moved her soul to\r\nits very depths, her horror was tempered with tenderness, when she heard\r\nthat Castruccio had been brought back wounded to Lucca. The glory of\r\nthis victory was attributed to him alone; and this glory, which appeared\r\na shame to Euthanasia, excited in her feelings of confusion and sorrow.\r\nNow for the first time she felt the struggle in her soul, of inclination\r\nwarring with duty; for the first time she feared that she ought not to\r\nlove Castruccio; she thought of retreating to Florence, and of shutting\r\nhim out from her sight, if possible from her thoughts; yet, as she\r\nmeditated this, she thought she heard the soft tones of his melodious\r\nvoice sounding in her ears, and she sank into grief and tears.\r\n\r\nThis painful struggle ceased not, until she saw him again; and then, as\r\nbefore, all pain and doubt vanished. His cheek was pale from the\r\nconsequences of his wound, and his person, having thus lost its usual\r\ndecision of mien, was more interesting; but his eyes shone, and they\r\nbeamed unutterable love upon her. Truly did he look a hero; for power\r\nsat on his brow, and victory seemed to have made itself a home among the\r\nsmiles of his lips. \"Triumph, my sweet girl,\" he said; \"all my laurels\r\nare spoils for you. Nay, turn not away as if you disdained them; they\r\nare the assurances of the peace that you desire. Do not doubt me; do not\r\nfor a moment suffer a cloud of suspicion to darken your animated\r\ncountenance. This sword has made me master of peace and war; and need I\r\nsay, that my wise and gentle Euthanasia shall direct my counsels, her\r\nlove and honour being the aim and purpose of my life?\"\r\n\r\nUpon such words could aught but pardon and reconciliation attend?\r\n\r\nCastruccio's wound was slight, and soon healed. But he was now more than\r\never immersed in his political plans: throwing off the mask, he appeared\r\nopenly as the leader of a party against Uguccione; his palace was for\r\never open, and crowded with friends and followers; and, when he rode\r\nthrough the streets, he was attended by a band of the first nobles in\r\nLucca. To his other talents Castruccio joined a vein of raillery and\r\nbitter irony, which, when he chose to exert it, seemed to enter into and\r\nwither the soul of its object. His scoffs and mockery of the Faggiuola\r\nfamily were repeated through Lucca; and the person against whom they\r\nwere particularly directed, the governor whom Uguccione had appointed,\r\nwas a man formed to feel in every nerve the agony of derision.\r\n\r\nFrancesco having been killed at the battle of Monte Catini, Uguccione\r\nhad set his son Ranieri over the Lucchese. Ranieri was only\r\ntwo-and-twenty years of age; but his straight black hair fell over a\r\nforehead prematurely wrinkled; without the courage of his father, he\r\npossessed all his cunning and ambition, as much cruelty, and even more\r\ndeceit. He had long been a pretender to the hand of the countess of\r\nValperga,--with no hope except that with which his own vanity inspired\r\nhim: yet, when he perceived that Castruccio was his favoured rival, he\r\nfelt as if he had been robbed of his inheritance; and the beauty,\r\ntalents, and glory of his adversary made him taste to the dregs the cup\r\nof envy. The consciousness of power alone for a while restrained the\r\nmanifestation of his feelings. He soothed himself with the idea that\r\nCastruccio's life was in his hands; yet a lurking doubt prevented him\r\nfrom putting forth his strength; he glared on his enemy, as a tiger who\r\ncrouches within reach of his prey; but he dared not spring. He would\r\ngladly have got rid of his rival by private assassination; but\r\nCastruccio was too cautious, and ever went too well attended, to afford\r\nan opportunity for such a measure. Rivalry in love was however but a\r\nsmall part of the cause of the hate with which Ranieri was filled; for\r\nCastruccio no longer disguised his abhorrence of the cruelty of\r\nUguccione, or his contempt for the cowardly and artful policy of his\r\nson; and a man far less cunning than Ranieri might easily perceive that\r\nhe laboured day and night for the overthrow of the Faggiuola family.\r\n\r\nAn accidental scuffle brought these feelings into action; it were idle\r\nto attempt to discover the cause of a quarrel, at a period when civil\r\nbroils were so common, not only among the Italians; but when the\r\ncapitals of the French and English monarchs were often stained with\r\nblood on the most trivial occasions. This affray arose between the\r\ndependents of Ranieri and of count Fondi; Castruccio and his companions\r\njoined in it; and it ended in the rout and flight of Faggiuola's men,\r\none of whom was killed. Ranieri seized this opportunity to send to his\r\nfather with greater effect an account of the haughty conduct and\r\nmachinations of Castruccio. The truth had been sufficient to awaken the\r\nsuspicions of a man, whose rule it was never to permit an enemy to live;\r\nbut the colouring that Ranieri gave to the affair, made it appear as if\r\nopen war had been declared between the parties at Lucca. Uguccione had\r\nbathed his hands that very winter in the best blood of Pisa; and he\r\nconsidered one life more as a small sacrifice towards the completion of\r\nhis security. His advice therefore was to act cautiously, but swiftly,\r\nand that the next messenger might bring intelligence of the death of his\r\nadversary.\r\n\r\nThis direction filled Ranieri with unwonted joy; it smoothed the\r\nwrinkles of his brow, and lighted up his eyes with ferocity: he would\r\nwillingly have led forth his troops, and seized Castruccio in the midst\r\nof his partizans; but his deceitful disposition suggested to him a\r\nquieter, and as he imagined, a surer mode of proceeding. The enemies met\r\nat church; they disposed themselves on opposite sides of the aisle,--the\r\nfollowers of Castruccio viewed their opponents with a careless smile of\r\ncontempt, which was returned by a sullen scowl; while Ranieri manifested\r\nan alternation of gaiety and uneasiness, which his art could not\r\nentirely conceal. High mass being over, Castruccio was about to retire,\r\nwhen Ranieri, quitting his attendants, walked across the aisle; seeing\r\nhis movement, the followers of Antelminelli crowded about him; but he\r\nbade them fall back, and with a haughty step, and a smile of conscious\r\nsuperiority, he also advanced towards his enemy; they met midway, and\r\nthe two parties, their hands on their swords, watched every motion of\r\ntheir respective chiefs during this unexpected parley. Had not Ranieri's\r\ncharacter for artifice been impressed on every mind, his appearance\r\nmight now have lulled suspicion;--he smiled, and spoke with a loud,\r\ncareless voice; and what was hidden under this friendly outside seemed\r\nrather timidity, than enmity: Castruccio fixed his eagle-eye upon him;\r\nbut fear appeared to be the only feeling which lurked behind the\r\nfrankness that Ranieri wished to assume: nor did he shrink from the\r\nexamination; he spoke:\r\n\r\n\"Messer Castruccio, methinks you are much a stranger to my councils and\r\nboard. Do you suppose that my father forgets your services in his cause,\r\nor that he does not pray for an opportunity of shewing his gratitude?\r\nEvil reports, I own, have gone abroad to your disadvantage, and your\r\nabsence from my palace might give some colour to these; but I am not a\r\nsuspicious man, and trust the actions of my friends which speak in their\r\nfavour, more readily than the hearsay which traduces them. If any ill\r\nblood exists between us, and I am the cause of it, I freely ask your\r\npardon for any offence I may have given you, and request, as the seal of\r\nour reconciliation, that you would honour with your presence a poor\r\nbanquet I am to give to-night to the nobility of Lucca.\r\n\r\nCastruccio was somewhat astounded by this speech, which was concluded by\r\nthe offer of his hand from the speaker. Castruccio drew back, and\r\nreplied; \"My poor services, my lord, were offered to my country; from\r\nher I hope for gratitude, from your father I neither deserve nor expect\r\nthis meed. It were as well perhaps not to attempt to mix jarring\r\nelements; but, since you offer hospitality, I will freely accept it;\r\nfor, whatever cause of alienation may exist between us, you are a knight\r\nand a soldier, and I do not fear deceit.\"\r\n\r\nCastruccio withdrew; and the certainty of revenge alone could have\r\nquelled the deadly anger of Ranieri at the haughty and supercilious\r\ntreatment that he had received.\r\n\r\nBefore the hour for the banquet had arrived, Castruccio rode to the\r\ncastle of Valperga, and related the occurrence to Euthanasia. She\r\nlistened attentively, and then said: \"There is some deep plot in this; I\r\nknow Neri della Faggiuola; he is at once cowardly, artful, and cruel. Be\r\non your guard; I would intreat you not to go to this feast, but that,\r\ngoing with your followers, I do not see what danger you can incur; but\r\ndoubt not, that this, or any other friendly overture that may follow; is\r\nonly a snare in which it is expected that you will entangle yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear not, dear girl; I am open-hearted with my friends;--but I have\r\nbeen a soldier of fortune; and at such a school I may well have learned\r\nto detect wiles more deep, and politicians more cunning than Ranieri.\r\nLet him beware; this moon which has just bent her bow among the clouds\r\nof sunset, will not be two weeks old, when you may see this deep schemer\r\ntake his solitary way to Pisa, glad to escape from the vengeance that he\r\nso well merits.\"\r\n\r\nCastruccio attended the feast of Ranieri, accompanied by count Fondi and\r\nArrigo Guinigi. He had expected to find the rest of his friends and\r\npartizans assembled there, since they had all received invitations: but\r\nRanieri had acted with the utmost caution; and, a very short time before\r\nthe hour fixed for the banquet, he had sent messages to the friends of\r\nCastruccio, and under various pretexts, had, unknown one to the other,\r\nemployed them on different affairs which he pretended to be of the\r\ngreatest urgency. When therefore Castruccio entered the banquetting\r\nhall, he found only the officers of the German troop attached to the\r\nFaggiuola faction, some old men who had retired from public affairs, and\r\na few Guelph families who Ranieri supposed would remain neuter on the\r\npresent occasion. Castruccio observed this, and felt that all was not\r\nright; yet not for a moment did the expression of his physiognomy\r\nchange, or his frank demeanour betray any sign of suspicion. It was not\r\nthen the custom, as in the more barbarous society of France and England,\r\nto attend peaceful meetings as if armed for mortal combat; and\r\nCastruccio was unarmed, except with a small dagger, which as a matter of\r\ncaution he concealed about his person.\r\n\r\nThe repast was sumptuous; course succeeded course; and the most delicate\r\nsweetmeats and richest wines invited the guests to a prolongation of\r\ntheir pleasures. Castruccio was both from habit and principle\r\nabstemious, and the quiet of the banquet was first interrupted by a\r\nsarcasm of Ranieri, as he pointed to the quantity of water which his\r\nguest mingled with his wine. The latter replied; and his irony was the\r\nmore keen from the reputation of cowardice and luxury which his enemy\r\nbore. Ranieri grew pale; and, filling his own cup with pure wine, he\r\npresented it to Castruccio, saying; \"Nay, Messere, before you depart,\r\ndishonour not my pledge, but drink this cup of generous Cyprus, to the\r\noverthrow of the enemies of Faggiuola.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were the signal agreed upon with his soldiers; they suddenly\r\nentered, surrounded the other guests, and throwing themselves upon\r\nCastruccio, endeavoured to secure him. Twice he threw them off: and once\r\nhe had nearly drawn his stiletto from his bosom; but he was overpowered\r\nand manacled with heavy chains--yet, standing thus impotent, his\r\neagle-glance seemed to wither the soul of Ranieri, who, unable to give\r\nvoice to the irony with which he had intended to load his victim, gave\r\norders that he should be carried to prison.\r\n\r\nRanieri then addressed his guests, telling them, that the riotous\r\nbehaviour of Castruccio the preceding week, and the murder of one of his\r\nservants, were the just causes of his imprisonment. He bade them not\r\nfear any danger to their own persons, unless they should rashly attempt\r\nto disturb the due course of justice. Arrigo, with all the warmth of\r\nyouth, would have replied with bitter reproaches; but count Fondi,\r\nmaking him a signal of silence, and deigning only to cast on Ranieri a\r\nsmile of contempt, retreated with the youth from the violated board.\r\nRanieri invited his guests to continue their festivity, but in vain:\r\nthey were silent and confounded; one by one the Italians withdrew, and\r\nRanieri was left only with his officers who were chiefly Germans, and\r\nthe remainder of the evening was spent in that intemperate enjoyment of\r\nthe bottle, which the Italians held in wonder and contempt. Ranieri did\r\nnot wish to drown the voice of his conscience, for that was his servant,\r\nand not his monitor; but his coward spirit failed, when he reflected on\r\nhis critical situation, and the number and resoluteness of Castruccio's\r\nfriends: wine inspired him with boldness; and a riotous night succeeded\r\nand crowned a misspent day.\r\n\r\nNo feelings could be in more perfect contrast one to the other, than\r\nthose with which the jailer and his prisoner hailed the morning of the\r\nensuing day. Castruccio had slept soundly on the pavement of his\r\ndungeon; and, though his limbs were weighed down by chains, his spirit\r\nwas light and tranquil; he trusted to his friends, and he trusted to the\r\nintimate persuasion he felt, that his star was not to stoop before that\r\nof the cowardly and treacherous Ranieri. Looking at the clouds as they\r\npassed swiftly across the sun borne along by an irresistible wind, he\r\nchaunted a troubadour song of victory.\r\n\r\nRanieri awoke with those feelings of listless depression that succeed to\r\ndrunkenness; the idea that Castruccio was his prisoner struck him with\r\naffright; and now, repenting that he had taken so decided a measure, he\r\nsent for his favourite attendant, and bade him go and reconnoitre the\r\ntown, and endeavour to discover the opinions and temper of the citizens.\r\nDuring the absence of this man he was several times on the point of\r\nsending an order for the instantaneous death of his prisoner; but his\r\nheart failed him: he felt that he might be disobeyed, and that the\r\nmandate of death might be the signal for the deliverance of Castruccio.\r\nThus he waited, irresolutely, but impatiently, till circumstances should\r\ndecide the course he was to pursue.\r\n\r\nThe report of his messenger was ill calculated to allay his\r\napprehensions. Knots of citizens stood in the streets and market-place,\r\nwho, with serious mien and angry fervour, talked over the occurrence of\r\nthe preceding evening. Some friend of Castruccio was at the head of each\r\nof these, who incited the people to action, and, ridiculing the\r\ncowardice, and reprobating the treachery and cruelty of Ranieri,\r\nawakened in every heart love and reverence for Castruccio, by the well\r\ndeserved praises that he bestowed upon him. The word Liberty seemed to\r\nbe creeping among them and warming every soul, while it struck a blight\r\nupon the sensations of Ranieri: he dared not act, but sent a messenger\r\nto his father at Pisa, recounting what he had done, and desiring his\r\nassistance in the accomplishment of his revenge.\r\n\r\nA few weeks before, Uguccione had caused Bonconti and his son, two Pisan\r\nnobles, much loved and esteemed in that town, to be put to death: he had\r\nbefore committed flagrant injustices and legal murders in that city, and\r\nto these the people had submitted: but Bonconti was a man of\r\nunderstanding and courage; the Pisans had looked up to him as the\r\ninstrument of their deliverance from the tyrant; by his death this task\r\nseemed to devolve into their own hands, and their sullen looks and\r\nwhispered discontents shewed plainly that they were about to right\r\nthemselves. Uguccione sat unsteadily on his seat of power; and his\r\nuneasiness, as is often the case in minds untamed by humanity, begot in\r\nhim a hasty courage, and fierce rashness, that resolved not to yield to\r\nany obstacle; he was a stag at bay, and the Pisans stood about him\r\nwatching some weak side on which they might commence their attack.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the messenger of Ranieri arrived, relating the seizure of\r\nCastruccio, and the fears of the governor. \"Fool!\" cried Uguccione,\r\n\"does he not know that the members walk not without the head?\"\r\n\r\nSo, without giving one moment to reflection, he hastily called his\r\nfaithful troop together, consisting of about four hundred men, and,\r\nleaving Pisa, hastened at full gallop towards Lucca. The Pisans dared\r\nnot trust their good fortune, when they saw their enemy and his\r\nadherents voluntarily desert their post, and deliver a bloodless victory\r\ninto their hands; before Uguccione had reached the summit of Monte San\r\nGiuliano, which is, as Dante says, the\r\n\r\n\r\n_Perch\u00e8 i Pisan veder Lucca non ponno,_\r\n\r\n\r\nthe cry of liberty, and death to the tyrant, arose in the town; the\r\nmultitude assailed the house of Uguccione; some of his household fell;\r\nthe rest fled; and the crowd, now somewhat appeased, assembled to\r\nconstitute as their chief, a man of understanding and valor, who might\r\nbring under discipline the furious passions of the injured Pisans.\r\n\r\nUguccione found Lucca in open revolt: he entered the town, and at the\r\nhead of his troop endeavoured to charge the mutinous multitude. It was\r\nvain; firm barriers thrown across the streets impeded the horses, and\r\nthe tyrant was obliged to parley with the heads of the revolters. They\r\ndemanded Castruccio; and he was brought forth chained, and delivered to\r\nthem; his fetters were knocked off, and, mounting a charger brought by\r\none of his friends, his manacles carried as a trophy before him, he was\r\nled in triumph to his palace. The people almost worshipped him as he\r\npassed, and the air rang with acclamations in his favour; a crowd of his\r\nadherents, well armed, clustered about him, proud of their victory, and\r\nproud of the chief whom they had delivered. His chains were affixed to\r\nthe tower of his palace, in commemoration of this sudden change of\r\nfortune. Uguccione fled:--he did not wait to be expelled by the furious\r\npopulace; the news reached him of the revolt of Pisa, and it struck him\r\nwith a panic; he was accompanied by Ranieri; and, quitting Lucca by the\r\nnorthern gate, they hastened across the mountains to Lombardy, and in\r\none day fell from the rank of powerful chieftains, to be soldiers of\r\nfortune at the hire of the first prince who might require their\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nCastruccio and his adherents assembled in his palace to deliberate on\r\nthe government they should choose; the multitude assembled round, and\r\ndemanded to behold their beloved chief.--Castruccio shewed himself at\r\nthe balcony, and was saluted with one cry, as Lord of Lucca, and captain\r\nof the war against the Florentines: his friends joined in the\r\nacclamation; but Castruccio, who never allowed a momentary enthusiasm to\r\nobliterate the plan of conduct that he had marked out for himself, made\r\na sign for silence, which was obeyed. He then addressed the people, and,\r\nthanking them for their love and services, declared that he could not\r\nalone support the government of his town, and, after many modest\r\nobservations, requested a companion in the weighty task. The people\r\nacceded to his wishes, and the Cavaliere Pagano Quartezzano was named as\r\nthe sharer of his dignities and power under the appellation of consul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peace between Lucca and Florence.--Bindo._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ill news had travelled fast; and Euthanasia knew of the imprisonment\r\nof Castruccio the same evening that it had taken place. Well acquainted\r\nwith the cruel policy of the Faggiuola family and in particular with the\r\ndastard ferocity of Ranieri, her fears were wound up to an agonizing\r\nheight: more unhappy than the prisoner himself, she slept not, nor did\r\nshe seek sleep; but her thoughts were bent on the consideration of\r\nwhether she were able in any manner to assist her friend. She resolved\r\nat least to employ all the influence her possessions and connexions gave\r\nher, to arrest the hand of the murderer.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning young Guinigi arrived at the castle. If Arrigo\r\nadmired Castruccio, he adored Euthanasia; her sex and beauty might well\r\nhave a powerful effect on his youthful heart, and her simplicity and\r\npurity were more calculated to influence his inexperienced but active\r\nunderstanding, than the more studied courtesies of Castruccio. Her pale\r\ncheek and heavy eyes indicated the anxious thoughts that beset her; and\r\nArrigo hastened to tranquillize them. \"Fear not,\" he said, \"he shall\r\nnot, he cannot die. His friends watch over him; and Ranieri has by this\r\ntime learned, that he is more a prisoner among the guards in his palace,\r\nthan Castruccio chained in his dungeon.\"\r\n\r\nHe then detailed the plans of the Ghibeline party for the deliverance of\r\ntheir chief; and, having somewhat calmed the uneasiness of the countess,\r\nhe returned with haste to his post at Lucca.\r\n\r\nEuthanasia passed an anxious day. She was alone; if one may be called\r\nalone, whose thoughts descended not to the calm of solitary meditation,\r\nbut were actively engaged in the imagination of events passing but a few\r\nmiles distant. It was a warm April day, but sunless: for the Libeccio\r\nhad veiled the blue heavens with clouds which seemed to press down the\r\natmosphere, that unmoved by any breeze appeared even by its weight to\r\nencumber the flowers, and to destroy all elasticity either in vegetable\r\nor animal life. Poor Euthanasia walked restlessly on the plot of ground\r\nbefore the gate of her castle; and her languid eyes, bent towards Lucca,\r\nwere able to discern objects afar off, sharpened as their sight was by\r\nlove and fear. In the afternoon she saw a band of soldiers ride along\r\nthe road beneath the rock on which her castle was built, directing their\r\ncourse towards the northern mountains. She thought that she could\r\ndistinguish the uncouth figure of Uguccione in the tallest among the\r\nhorsemen who led the troop; while in the rear she felt sure that she\r\nbeheld the form of Ranieri.\r\n\r\nHer heart was now relieved from many of its fears; and she watched with\r\ngreater calmness the fading hues of sunset, and the moon, now but a day\r\nolder than when Castruccio had foretold the overthrow of the tyrant. She\r\nhad a favourite retreat near a spring that issued from the rock behind\r\nher castle. The mountain was almost perpendicular from which it gushed;\r\nbut a rude flight of steps had been cut, by which she ascended to it\r\nthrough a postern. The spring rose from a rift above, and fell first on\r\na narrow rocky platform about seventy steps above the castle. Euthanasia\r\nhad caused a basin to be scooped here for the reception of the water,\r\nand had covered it with a light portico, supported by fluted columns of\r\nthe Etruscan order made of the finest marble; a few mossy seats\r\nsurrounded the fountain. The rock shaded her as she sat, on whose stony\r\nface grew nothing but heath, and such shrubs as seem to find nutriment\r\nand growth in stone itself; but the top was crowned by ilex trees and\r\nstunted myrtle underwood. Thither she now retired, and watched the\r\ncoming night; when suddenly she thought she heard a rustling above her,\r\nand a small bunch of myrtle fell on her lap; she looked up; and, gazing\r\nearnestly, perceived Castruccio, with one hand grasping a myrtle shrub,\r\nleaning from the summit of the precipice.\r\n\r\n\"Euthanasia!--Victory!\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"Victory and security!\" she repeated with a deep sigh of joy.\r\n\r\n\"And glory, and all the blessings of Heaven!\" he replied. She answered,\r\nbut he was far above, and could scarcely hear the words she spoke; he\r\nthrew another sprig of myrtle, and said, \"To-morrow!\" and retreated. She\r\ncontinued to look upwards to the spot where he had leaned; the rustling\r\nof the leaves was still--the myrtles that had bent as he leaned upon\r\nthem, slowly upraised themselves--yet still she thought that she heard\r\nhis voice, until the murmuring of the near stream recalled her to\r\nherself, and told her how moveless every thing else was.\r\n\r\nAnd now Euthanasia was happy--too happy; and fast-falling and many tears\r\nalone relieved her full heart. She was happy in the assurance of the\r\nsafety and triumph of her friend; but it was his love that touched her\r\nheart, and made her thrill with delight. What sweeter meed is there in\r\nlife, than the approbation and sincere friendship of those whom we\r\napprove and admire? But to be loved by such a one; to feel the deep\r\nsympathy of united affections, the delicious consciousness of being\r\nloved by one whom all the world approves, by one who fully justifies his\r\nclaim to the world's esteem by an oblivion of self, and heroic sacrifice\r\nof personal felicity for the public cause, touches a chord--opens a\r\nspring of feeling which those have never known, whose hearts have not\r\nbeen warmed by public feeling, or who have not entered with interest\r\ninto the hopes and fears of a band struggling for liberty. The human\r\nsoul disdains all restraint, and ever seeks to mingle with nature\r\nitself, or with kindred minds; to hope and fear for oneself alone often\r\nnarrows the heart and understanding; but if we are animated by these\r\nfeelings in unison with a multitude, bound by the same desires and the\r\nsame perils, such participation of triumph or sorrow exalts and\r\nbeautifies every emotion.\r\n\r\nYet triumph is a feeling which oppresses the human heart; and that\r\nstrangely fashioned instrument seems more adapted for suffering than\r\nenjoyment; it is rather a passive, than an active principle; abundant\r\njoy fills it with melancholy, but it can extract pleasure from the\r\ndepths of despair. Euthanasia was overpowered; and she felt, in that\r\nmoment of satisfaction to her hopes, an agitation and unquiet repining,\r\nwhich, though it were indeed only the rebellion of the heart against\r\npeace, seemed to her in after times as the foreboding of the unlooked\r\nfor catastrophe to so much happiness.\r\n\r\nThe following evening Castruccio again visited her, and restored her to\r\ncalm. He sat at her feet, and fixing on her his dark eyes, related the\r\ncircumstances of his imprisonment and liberation. \"Did you not wonder,\"\r\nsaid he, \"at your eagle's visit yesternight? I would indeed that I had\r\nbeen one, so that I could have cast myself at your feet, instead of the\r\nsilly myrtle that I threw! Yester evening, after the business of the\r\nday, I went to the castle of Mordecastelli, which is on this same\r\nmountain, not far from the Fairy's Fountain and the cypress, under which\r\nas children we often sat--which we visited a few weeks ago, clambering\r\nto it from the valley. When I left his castle, I passed by that spot;\r\nand, pausing there, I thought that perhaps I could not only attain the\r\nsummit of the rock that overlooks your fountain, but in some way get\r\ndown to the alcove itself, and thus surprize your retreat. I was\r\ndisappointed; the precipice is too high above;--but as I looked down, I\r\ncaught a glance of your robe, and was repaid for my toil, in being able\r\nto communicate to you the news of my success. And now, dearest girl, be\r\nhappy, and smile contentedly on me; for now that I have overcome my\r\ndomestic enemies, and have supreme power in this hive of ours, you shall\r\ndirect me, and there shall be the peace that you love, and the concord\r\nyou so much desire between us and the proud republicans, your friends.\"\r\n\r\nEuthanasia smiled, and said, \"Well may it please one so nearly useless\r\nas I am, that I can save the lives of some of my fellow-citizens. Do you\r\nnot know, dearest Castruccio, that when you draw your sword against the\r\nFlorentines, it is always wetted with the blood of my best friends? Love\r\nyou indeed I always must; but I know, for I have studied my own heart,\r\nthat it would not unite itself to yours, if, instead of these thoughts\r\nof peace and concord, you were to scheme war and conquest.\"\r\n\r\n\"You measure your love in nice scales,\" replied Castruccio,\r\nreproachfully; \"surely, if it were as deep as mine, it would be ruled\r\nalone by its own laws, and not by outward circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nEuthanasia answered earnestly, \"So can it not be with me; I have been\r\nbred in a city distracted by domestic faction, and which, when it\r\nobtains a moment of peace in its own bosom, loses the flower of its\r\nchildren in petty wars. A hatred and fear of war is therefore a strong\r\nand ruling passion in my heart; but other feelings mingle with these in\r\nmy zeal for your concord with my fellow-townsmen. Florence is my native\r\ncity; its citizens are bound to me by the ties of consanguinity and\r\nfriendship: the families of the Pazzi, the Donati, the Spini, and other\r\nnoble or plebeian Florentines, against whom you fight when you war with\r\nthem, each contains individuals whom I love and honour. I should be a\r\ntraitor to the best feelings of human nature, and a rebel to my country,\r\nif I allied myself to its enemy: think you that I who have joined in the\r\nsocial meetings of the Florentines, who as a child was caressed by them,\r\nand as a woman loved, who have been present at their marriages, and have\r\nmourned among them at their funerals,--when my own beloved father was\r\nattended to his grave by these men whom you call your enemies, and my\r\nown bitter sorrows assuaged by the sympathy of their daughters,--think\r\nyou, that thus linked by every social tie, having prayed, and rejoiced,\r\nand wept with them, that I could say to you, 'Go, prosper!' when you\r\nshould go to destroy them? Dearest Castruccio, if, united to you, such\r\nan event were to ensue, in that moment I must die, or live a death in\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nCastruccio replied only by fresh assurances of his earnest desire for\r\npeace, and kissed from the brow of Euthanasia the cloud that for a\r\nmoment had gathered there.\r\n\r\nIt had been a strange task to unveil the heart of Antelminelli, and to\r\ndisentangle the contradictory feelings that influenced him at that\r\nmoment. There can be no doubt that he never forgot his designs for the\r\naggrandizement of his native city; and he had seen too much of courts,\r\nand felt too strongly his own superiority to the men about him, to allow\r\nus to suppose that he entertained the idea of establishing a free\r\nrepublic there, and submitting his actions and intentions to be\r\ncontroled by the people. It had long been his earnest desire to raise\r\nand reinstate the fallen Ghibeline party in Tuscany; and this was not to\r\nbe accomplished except by the humiliation of the Florentines: yet at\r\nthis time his whole policy was employed in concluding a peace with\r\nthem,--a peace, which was ratified the following April, and preserved\r\nfor three years. These three years it is true were not spent in\r\ninactivity, but in the reduction of the surrounding country, and,\r\nlatterly, in preparation for the successful war he afterwards carried on\r\nagainst Florence. Are therefore his protestations to Euthanasia to be\r\nconsidered as wholly deceitful? His frank countenance and unembarrassed\r\nvoice forbade that idea for a moment to cross her imagination: we may\r\nperhaps form this conclusion;--that he now found it for his interest to\r\nconclude a peace with Florence; and he made the sincerity of his present\r\npurpose lend its colour to his assurances for the future.\r\n\r\nA whole year was spent in the arrangement of the treaty. Euthanasia\r\npassed all that time at her castle; and her content was again disturbed\r\nby the successes of Castruccio; who in treating for peace did not fail\r\nto make it more desirable to his enemies, by seizing every opportunity\r\nto defeat their forces, and lay waste their country; nor did the\r\nknowledge of the pain which these operations caused his friend, in any\r\ndegree check his activity. Euthanasia loved Castruccio; but her\r\njudgement was penetrating, and she was so accustomed to meditate on the\r\nevents and feelings of each day, that, during this time, she in part\r\npenetrated the character of her lover. He was formed for victory and\r\ndaring, rather than for magnanimity: he was swift of design and steady\r\nin execution; bold, valiant, yet gentle of manner; his wit was keen; his\r\npenetration into the dispositions of men instantaneous; and he possessed\r\nalso, as by instinct, the faculty of adapting himself to every\r\ncharacter, and of acquiring the love of all around him: men always love\r\nthose who lead them successfully through danger. He was temperate in his\r\nhabits; and in his mien, though the exterior were ardent and even rash,\r\nthere might be perceived underneath a reserve of caution, a presence of\r\nmind, which never permitted him to be carried beyond the dictates of\r\nprudence, and an eagle-eye which caused him swiftly to distinguish\r\ndanger from impracticability. He trod the most perilous activities, but\r\nhis foot was sure like that of the chamois; and he could discern from\r\nafar where the path was broken, and would check himself in the most\r\nheadlong course. All this was well; but, underneath a frankness of\r\nbehaviour, and an apparent nobleness of nature, there was the craft of a\r\ngrey-haired courtier, and even at times the cruelty of a falling tyrant.\r\nEuthanasia saw not all this; but at times a glance, a tone seemed to\r\nopen a mine of undiscovered evil in his character, that made her shudder\r\nin the very depths of her nature: yet this sensation would pass away,\r\nand she, prompt to forget evil in others, thought no more of it.\r\n\r\nThis year might be called the happiest of her life; yet it was that\r\nwhich first schooled her to the pain and anguish which were afterwards\r\nher portion. The flower of love can never exist without its thorns. She\r\nloved, and was beloved:--her eyes beamed with a quicker fire; and her\r\nwhole soul, perfectly alive, seemed to feel with a vividness and truth\r\nshe had never before experienced. Nature was invested for her with new\r\nappearances; and there was a beauty, a soul, in the breeze of evening,\r\nthe starry sky, and uprising sun, which filled her with emotions she had\r\nnever before so vividly felt. Love seemed to have made her heart its\r\nchosen temple; and he linked all its beatings to that universal beauty\r\nwhich is his mother and his nurse.\r\n\r\nThere are feelings, which overpower the human soul, and often render it\r\nmorbid and weak, if virtuous action does not give dignity to reverie.\r\nEuthanasia had many occupations, and among them the glorious and\r\ndelightful one of rendering her numerous dependents happy. The cottages\r\nand villages over which she presided, were filled by a contented\r\npeasantry, who adored their countess, and knew her power only by the\r\nbenefits she conferred on them. Castruccio often accompanied her in her\r\nvisits to these; and he, accustomed as he was to count men as the\r\nnumerals of a military arithmetic, even he was touched by her care for\r\nthe sick, her many ways of displaying her judgement and abounding\r\nbenevolence towards her people. Yet sometimes he laughed at the\r\ndifference between her practice and her theory, and asked the youthful\r\nsovereign, why she did not erect her states into a republic?\r\n\r\nShe smiled; but then, collecting herself, answered seriously; \"When I\r\nfirst inherited my mother's power, I gave much consideration to this\r\nvery question; not of forming a separate republic of my poor villages,\r\nbut of incorporating them, as many nobles have done, and as doubtless\r\nthe lords of Valperga will one day be obliged to do, with some\r\nneighbouring and more powerful republic. My inclinations led me to join\r\nmyself to Florence; but the distance of that city, and the immediate\r\nvicinity of Lucca, shewed me the impracticability of that project.\r\nValperga must one day fall into the hands of the Lucchese; but, if I had\r\nat any time made an alliance with them, I should have destroyed the\r\npresent happiness of my people; there would have been war instead of\r\npeace, instead of concord and plenty, party agitations and heavy taxes.\r\nThis, my friend, must be my excuse for my tyranny; but, when the\r\nalliance between you and the Florentines can be sure, when Lucca is as\r\npeaceful and happy as Valperga, believe me, I will no longer arrogate a\r\npower to which I ought not to have a pretension.\"\r\n\r\nCastruccio smiled; he hardly believed the simple sincerity of\r\nEuthanasia; he understood well and judged with sagacity the balancing\r\nobjections in a question of interest; but the principle of decision was\r\nalways with him, that which would most conduce to the fulfilment of his\r\nprojects, seldom that of the good or evil which affected others. Yet\r\nthis was veiled even to his own mind, by a habit of gentleness and\r\nforbearance, which even in this age of the world, often fills the place,\r\nand assumes the form of virtue.\r\n\r\nAnd now Euthanasia was busy in preparing for a court, which she had\r\ndetermined to hold, when peace should be ratified between the contending\r\npowers of Tuscany; and Castruccio found her employed in the, for her,\r\nunwonted toils, of the arrangement of silks, jewels, and tapestry. She\r\nsaid: \"You know that the dependents of Valperga are lightly taxed; and\r\nthe little money that enters my coffers is chiefly expended in the\r\nsuccour of their own necessities: yet of that little I have reserved a\r\nsum for periods of sickness, scarcity, or any more agreeable occasion\r\nthat may call for it. A part of this will be expended on the present\r\nsolemnity. Nor do I think that I hurt my good people by such an\r\nextravagance: their joy on this occasion will be far greater than mine;\r\ntheir pride and love of pleasure will be gratified; for in arranging the\r\namusements of my court the country people will have a full share; and,\r\nif _we_ engage the attention of Borsiere, Guarino and other\r\ndistinguished _Uomini di Corte,_ the buffoons, jugglers, and dancers,\r\nwill spread glee among the villagers.\"\r\n\r\nThe castle was fuller than usual of dependents and workmen, and its\r\ncloister-like silence was exchanged for the noise of the hammer, and the\r\nvoices of Italians, ever louder than need is. Euthanasia witnessed their\r\neagerness with pleasure; and her undisguised sympathy in their feelings\r\nmade her adored by her servants and dependents. She had now about her\r\nseveral of the daughters of her richer subjects, who assisted in the\r\narrangement of her castle: and there were gathered in the hall men who\r\nhad grown grey on her estate, who remembered the dreadful battle of\r\nMonte Aperto, the fall of Manfred, and the death of the last unfortunate\r\ndescendant of Frederic Barbarossa. These recounted the feats and dangers\r\nof their youth to their descendants, until, so strange are the feelings\r\nof our nature, war, peril and ruin seemed joys to be coveted, not perils\r\nto be eschewed.\r\n\r\nAmong the attendants who most constantly waited on her person, was a man\r\nwho, from his diminutive stature, and strange dress, might have been\r\ntaken for the buffoon or dwarf so common at the courts of princes in\r\nthose days, had not the melancholy of his looks forbidden that\r\nsupposition. Yet he had some of the privileges of the licensed fool; for\r\nhe mingled in the conversation of his superiors, and his remarks,\r\ngenerally pithy, were sometimes bitter and satirical: yet indeed they\r\nwere more commonly characterized by a wild and imaginative originality,\r\nthan by wit; and, if they sometimes made others laugh, he never smiled.\r\nThe playful and witty disposition of Castruccio would often make him\r\nenter into conversation with, and reply to, and try to draw out this\r\nstrange being, who was no less uncommon in his person than in his mind.\r\nHe was of that race of which there are a few native specimens in Italy,\r\ngenerally called Albinois; his complexion was of a milky fairness, his\r\nhair white, and his long white eyelashes hardly shaded his light red\r\neyes: he was brief of stature, and as slender as he was short; the\r\nsoftness of his features, and the roundness and flexibility of his\r\nlimbs, manifested his want of strength; his mild, but almost meaningless\r\nphysiognomy betrayed the want of judgment, courage, and all the more\r\nmanly virtues. His mind seemed to approach the feebler spark of animal\r\nlife, had it not been redeemed by an imagination of which he hardly\r\nappeared conscious himself, but which raised him above many of the\r\nbrutal and rough peasants who despised him. Sometimes Castruccio laughed\r\nat Euthanasia for keeping this strange creature about her, but she\r\ndefended herself, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, my lord, you must shew no disrespect towards this servant of\r\nmine, and truly you will be little inclined to do so, when I have summed\r\nup all his good qualities. First, he has by heart, ready to quote on any\r\nsuitable occasion, every prophecy that has been made since the time of\r\nAdam, and knows all the vulgar expositions of the sacred texts. Then he\r\nis an adept in the knowledge of sacred trees, fountains, and stones, the\r\nflight of birds, lucky and unlucky days; he has an extensive\r\nacquaintance with witches, astrologers, sorcerers, and _tempestarii_[5],\r\nhe knows every peculiar ceremony for remarkable days, how to celebrate\r\nthe calends of January, those of August, and the _Vindemie Nolane_; none\r\nof our cattle are blest by St. Anthony until he has bound on their\r\ncrowns; the ceremonies attendant on the Nativity, Easter, and other\r\nfeasts, are all conducted under his guidance. He interprets all the\r\ndreams of the castle, and foretells the point of time when to begin any\r\nenterprise; he has a wonderful assortment of holy legends and strange\r\nrelics; such as a lock of Adam's hair, a little of the sawdust from\r\nNoah's saw-pit when he clove the planks for the ark, a brick of the\r\ntower of Babel, and a tooth of St. Theresa; he has presented many of\r\nthese to the priest of San Martino, and the people go and adore these\r\nshreds and patches of religion with the veneration that its divine\r\nmorality alone demands. Although of a feminine and un-muscular form, he\r\nis healthy; he is silent to a miracle; and among my noisy household he\r\nalone flits about unheard, so much so that I have been assured that\r\ngrass yields not beneath his feet, and that he has no shadow; but you\r\ncan yourself ascertain that fact. I believe him to be faithful, yet I\r\nthink him to be attached to none, except the wild beings whom his\r\nimagination invests with supernatural powers. But he is an excellent\r\nguide for me in my various wanderings, since, as if he had a clue of\r\nthread, he can find his unerring way amid the most pathless desarts and\r\nforests. With all these wonderful acquirements he is generally disliked;\r\nhe is said to be the son of a witch, and to have a natural propensity to\r\nevil; yet I have never heard of any ill act of his doing; although in\r\ntruth some strange events have taken place with regard to him, that look\r\nas if he had communion with the spirits of air.\r\n\r\n\"I have said that he is attached to no one among us, yet I may be wrong.\r\nIf he is always near my person, it is because he seizes every moment,\r\nwhen he is permitted to enter, to creep near me. Once, when I left him\r\nhere during a visit to Florence, be pined for some time, till every one\r\nbelieved that he was about to die; and then taking a sudden resolution,\r\nlike a dog following the scent of his master, he departed on foot, and\r\nin less than twenty-four hours, arrived half dead with fatigue at my\r\npalace at Florence.\r\n\r\n\"I have another motive for being attached to him: he was a favourite of\r\nmy father. He found him when a child, in a village not far from\r\nFlorence, half starved, and ill treated by the country people; for he\r\ncould not work, and, being an orphan, was destitute of every resource;\r\nthe idea of his unholy parentage and his strange appearance, rendering\r\nthe country-people even malignantly inclined towards him. He loved my\r\nfather, and almost sunk to the grave with sorrow when he died; nor at\r\nthat time would he leave the room where I was, or if obliged to go, he\r\ncrept near the door crouching like a dog for the moment of admittance.\"\r\n\r\nThis being was now very busy amidst the preparations for the court;\r\npreparations which engaged all the hands and all the heads of Valperga.\r\nWhile the countess made provision for the entertainment of her guests,\r\nher dependents practised the games and exercises with which they should\r\namuse the nobles: all was bustle and animation, but all was joy and good\r\nhumour. Castruccio and Euthanasia became dearer to each other, as he\r\nperceived the pleasure he was able to bestow upon her by a compliance\r\nwith her wishes; and she felt gratitude for the delight she enjoyed,\r\ntowards him whom she fondly looked upon as its cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Persons supposed to have the power of commanding\r\nthe elements.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\n_Euthanasia holds a Court._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the day approached on which Euthanasia was to hold her court, her\r\ncastle became thronged with the nobility, wealth, and beauty of Tuscany\r\nand Lombardy. She had wished indeed to make this a public union of the\r\ntwo parties which distracted Italy; but she was so noted a Guelph that\r\nfew Ghibelines appeared, although some were attracted by the name of\r\nCastruccio, to come under his escort, and in his company. First arrived\r\nher uncle, the lord Radolfo di Casaregi; he was an old man, but he loved\r\nto encircle his bare temples with an iron helmet, and to try his well\r\nused sword against the unfleshed blades of the sons of his companions in\r\narms in days gone by. Then came the marquess Marcello Malespino of\r\nValdimagra, his wife, and three lovely daughters; they were accompanied\r\nby three brothers of the Bondelmonti family of Florence: these claimed\r\naffinity to the house of Adimari, and when by the laws of her country\r\nEuthanasia was obliged to choose a guardian for her maiden state, she\r\nhad selected the eldest, count Bondelmonte de' Bondelmonti to be her\r\n_Mondualdo_; this relationship had given rise to a sincere friendship,\r\nwhich, although the difference of age was inconsiderable, and the same\r\nreverence and obedience could never be felt or exercised, yet in some\r\nsort was to Euthanasia in the stead of her dead parents. There arrived\r\nsoon after the chief members of the Pazzi, Donati, Visdomini,\r\nGianfigliazi, and other Guelph families of Florence; there was Alberti\r\ncount of Capraia, and all the numerous troop that claimed relationship\r\nto him; and many others, both Bianchi and Neri, both Guelph and\r\nGhibeline, whose names it would be needless to detail.\r\n\r\nThen arrived a multitude of _Uomini di Corte_; story-tellers,\r\n_improvisatori_, musicians, singers, actors, rope-dancers, jugglers and\r\nbuffoons. The most distinguished among the first class was William\r\nBorsiere[6]; a man of courteous yet frank manners, nice wit and keen\r\npenetration: he was about forty years of age; but he had lost none of\r\nthe jovial temper of youth, and his generous and even noble disposition\r\nmade him more respected than men of his class usually were. There was\r\nBergamino, a man more caustic than Borsiere, but whose insinuating\r\naddress obtained pardon for his biting words; no one knew better than\r\nBergamino to cure the wounds his tongue had made. There was Andreuccio,\r\nwhose satirical mood and rough manners frequently drew upon him the\r\nanger of the nobles on whose favour he depended; and he was so often\r\ndismissed, disgraced and unrewarded, from the courts, where his\r\ncompanions were loaded with presents, that, from his mean and sometimes\r\nragged appearance, and his snarling habits, he went by the name of the\r\n_Cane Mendicante_. He wished to rival Borsiere and Bergamino who were\r\nstaunch friends, and endeavoured to make up for his lack of the more\r\ndelicate kind of wit by caustic sayings and contemptuous remarks. There\r\nwas Ildone, a foolish, smiling fellow, but who sang sorrowful airs with\r\nso sweet and touching a voice, that, if you shut your eyes, you might\r\nhave imagined that St. Cecilia herself had descended to entrance the\r\nworld with heavenly melody.\r\n\r\nGuarino, the _Improvisatore_, closed the list of the distinguished\r\n_Uomini di Corte_. He was sought in every court in Lombardy for his\r\nentertaining qualities: his tales displayed the fire of genius, and the\r\ndelicate observations of a lover of nature. But he was eaten up by\r\nvanity and envy; he hated all those who were admired, from the princely\r\nbeauty who attracted all regards, down to the lowest buffoon at court.\r\nIf he were sought by the great, so much the more was he avoided by his\r\nequals and inferiors; to the first he tricked himself out with a\r\nflattering tongue, a mean and servile address, and gross adulation; for\r\nthe second he expressed hatred and contempt; and he tyrannized over the\r\nlast with a hand of iron. But all three classes might equally dread his\r\nmalignant calumnies, and hatred of all that was good. He spared no art,\r\nno wit, no falsehood, to detract from merit, however exalted or lowly;\r\nand so full was he of wiles, that he was seldom detected in his serpent\r\ncraft. He had been a Ghibeline, and at one time was imprisoned by the\r\nDominican inquisitors as a heretic; but now he surpassed all the\r\nItalians in superstition and credulity; his friends said that he was\r\ntruly pious, his enemies that he was the most deceitful of hypocrites:\r\nbut the trait that sealed his character, was his intolerance and violent\r\npersecution of his former heretical associates. Those who were most\r\nindulgent said, that he had been first actuated by fear, and was now a\r\nsincere convert; he himself pretended to attribute his conversion to a\r\nmiracle, and of such consequence was he in his own eyes, that he almost\r\naffirmed that a saint from heaven had informed him, that the redemption\r\nof mankind had been undertaken by the Almighty Saviour for his benefit\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nMany others followed and joined these; but they were a nameless\r\nmultitude, distinguished only for vulgar talents; some trying to raise a\r\nlaugh by folly, others by pert wit; many by manual jests upon each\r\nother, in which innumerable were the blows given and received: they were\r\na strange set, and whether they were handsome or ugly, old or young,\r\nagile or slow, expert or awkward, they turned even their defects to\r\naccount, and with a never-ceasing grin, thronged around the nobles,\r\nforming a contrast to the dignified deportment and rich dresses of the\r\nlatter, by their supple and serpentine motions, strange gait, and motley\r\nhabiliments; some being ragged from lack of wit, others from detected\r\nroguery, all regarding with the eagerness of starved curs the riches of\r\nthe castle, and the generosity of its mistress.\r\n\r\nThe court opened on the first of May; it was to last four days; and, on\r\nthe evening before, surrounded by her guests, Euthanasia issued forth\r\nthe laws for their amusements on the occasion: \"The first day,\" said\r\nshe, \"we will give to hunting and hawking; the country is well stocked\r\nwith game, and each guest has surely his falcon on his fist. I will\r\ninstal Antelminelli, the _liberatore_ of Lucca, king for that day; for\r\nhe has been in foreign countries, and has studied these amusements under\r\nthe best masters of the age; and I doubt not is well able to direct our\r\nexertions, and secure us plentiful sport.\r\n\r\n\"The second day we will give up to our friends, the _Uomini di Corte_:\r\nthey shall do their best to please us, and to deserve the rewards in\r\nstore for them; certainly none will censure my choice, when I name\r\nWilliam Borsiere king of that day. Let him direct the exertions of the\r\nrest, so that their tales, their songs, and their feats may succeed one\r\nanother in agreeable variety.\r\n\r\n\"On the third day the lists shall be set, and the knights will tilt for\r\nthe honour of their ladies' beauty; the conqueror shall receive as the\r\nreward of his prowess the liberty of choosing the queen for the\r\nfollowing day, who will direct the sports of the ladies, and close with\r\ntheir games the gaieties of my court.\"\r\n\r\nA shout of applause followed the enunciation of these laws; and it was\r\ndeclared by all, that no better could be devised for the promotion of\r\namusement among their joyful assembly.\r\n\r\nOn the first of May the sun arose in cloudless splendour. The steeds\r\nrichly caparisoned were led from the stable; the ladies were mounted on\r\ngentle palfreys, and were followed by the esquires, holding the hawks,\r\nor with the dogs in leash; others sounding the awakening horn, while the\r\nair resounded with voices which called the idlers from their rooms, and\r\nsaid that the hunter deserved no game, who was not with the first\r\na-field to brush the morning dew from the grass. Euthanasia headed a\r\nchosen band supreme in beauty; her soft and enthusiastic eyes now\r\nsparkled with joy, which the fair expanse of her smooth brow shewed to\r\nbe yet uninvaded by the fang of a bitter sorrow; a smile hovered on her\r\nbeautiful lips, like Love playing among the leaves of a rose; her golden\r\nhair shone under the sunbeams, and clustered round her neck white as\r\nmarble, and, like that enriched by many a wandering vein, eclipsing the\r\njewels of her dress; her motions, free as the winds, and graceful as an\r\nantelope of the south, appeared more than human in their loveliness;\r\nand, when she awoke the air with her silver voice, silence seemed on the\r\nwatch to drink in the sound.\r\n\r\nAnd now away!----They rode down the steep on which the castle stood, to\r\na chesnut wood, and thence along a plain covered with brushwood: all was\r\nalive and gay; the huntsmen called to their dogs;--the knights reined in\r\ntheir restless steeds;--and the ladies with animated gestures, laughing\r\nlooks, and upturned eyes, watched the flight of their birds, and betted\r\nupon their speed.\r\n\r\nWhen noon approached, they became heated and tired, and looked around\r\nfor a shady spot where they might repose. Castruccio rode forward, and\r\nsaid:--\"I should ill deserve the honour of being king of this day, if I\r\nsuffered my fair subjects to wander as in a desart without refreshment\r\nor repose--follow me!\"\r\n\r\nThey entered a chesnut wood; and, after riding about half a mile, they\r\ncame to a small plot of ground, encircled by trees, and protected from\r\nthe heat by canopies which ware fastened to the boughs: a magnificent\r\nrepast was prepared in this retreat; a profusion of wines glittered in\r\nglass vessels; the tables were piled with every delicate sweetmeat, as\r\nwell as with the more substantial fare of flesh and fowl.\r\n\r\nThe esquires having fastened their falcons to the branches of the trees,\r\nand covered their eyes with the hood, seized the large carving knives,\r\nand began their ministry; while the joyous band seated themselves on the\r\ncushions that had been provided for their accommodation.\r\n\r\nAfter the repast was ended, they reposed under this delicious shade,\r\nwatching the changeful shadows of the trees, and listening to the songs\r\nof the birds--\"How delightful it would be,\" cried Calista di Malespino,\r\n\"if Ildone or Guarino were here, whose songs rival the sweetest birds!\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow these men will display their talents,\" said Castruccio;\r\n\"to-day we must amuse ourselves.\" Then clapping his hands, several\r\nservants brought forward musical instruments, such as were then in\r\nfashion, unlike in form those now used, but which in sound and\r\nconstruction might be compared to the lute, the harp, the guitar, and\r\nthe flute. Many of the company had sweet voices; some who came from\r\nGenoa, sang the romances of the Proven\u00e7al minstrels; the Florentines\r\nsang the canzones of Dante, or chosen passages from the Teroretto of his\r\nmaster, Ser Brunetto Latini, or indeed stanzas of their own composing,\r\nfor the Florentines were an ingenious race, and few among the nobles had\r\npassed the boundary between youth and age, without having indited more\r\nthan one sonnet to his mistress's eyebrow: the inhabitants of each\r\nseparate town had a favourite poet, whose verses they now rehearsed.\r\n\r\nThus the time passed, till the sun descended, and the lengthening\r\nshadows told them that the heat was gone, and the light of day well nigh\r\nspent; when they mounted their horses, and rode towards the castle along\r\nthe skirts of the chesnut wood. The high Apennines were still white with\r\nsnow; and, as evening came on, a refreshing breeze blew across the\r\nplain, and sang among the branches of the trees,--at a distance was\r\nheard the murmuring of the Serchio, as it travelled along in its\r\nunwearied course; the air was perfumed by a thousand scents, for the\r\ngrass was mowing, and bathed the element in sweetness. From out one\r\ncopse a nightingale poured forth its melodious notes, singing as it were\r\nto one lone star that peered through the glowing sunset; Arrigo taking\r\nhis flute drew a responsive strain which the sweet bird strove to\r\nimitate, while the cavalcade passed silently along. Darkness closed\r\naround, and the first fire-flies of summer issued from their deep green\r\nbowers among the bushes, and darted forth their gentle, ineffectual\r\nflame, skimming over the fields, which, as a phosphoric sea, or as a\r\ngreen heaven of evershifting planets, now was dark, and again thickly\r\nstudded by these stars. The glow-worm on the ground slowly trailed his\r\nsteady light; a few bats flew from the rocks; and the regular moan of\r\nthe Agiolo wheeled about the trees, and spoke of fine days to come. As\r\nthe home-ward hunters ascended the mountain, the breeze died away, and a\r\nbreathless stillness pervaded the atmosphere; Euthanasia rode near\r\nCastruccio; her sweet countenance bespoke a deeper joy than mere gaiety,\r\nand her wild eyes shone with her emotion. She had thrown her capuchin\r\nover her head; and her face, fair as the moon encircled by the night,\r\nshone from beneath the sable cowl, while her golden locks twined\r\nthemselves round her neck: Castruccio gazed on her, and would have given\r\nworlds to have embraced her, and to print on her glowing cheek a kiss of\r\nlove; he dared not,--but his heart swelled with joy, when she turned to\r\nhim with an affectionate smile, and he whispered his heart--\"She is\r\nmine.\"\r\n\r\nThe second day William Borsiere was prepared to amuse the guests by his\r\nown and his companions' talents. His task was more difficult to perform\r\nthan that of Castruccio, for his materials were not so easy to be\r\ncontroled as hawks and hounds. Guarino was mortally offended by the\r\nchoice of Euthanasia with regard to the king of the day, and declared\r\nthat he had a cold, and could not sing. Nothing but his intolerable\r\nvanity vanquished his sullenness; for, when he found that, upon his\r\nrefusal, Borsiere passed him by, and that his ill humour would only\r\npunish himself by consigning him to obscurity, he consented to be\r\nnumbered among the recruits of the day. Andreuccio was less tractable,\r\nfor he was less vain; and it was sheer avarice that caused his anger,\r\nwhen he imagined that Borsiere would be the best paid of the company; he\r\nabsolutely refused to perform his part in story-telling, but reserved\r\nhis wit for endeavours to turn to ridicule the amusements and exertions\r\nof his favoured rival.\r\n\r\nIn the morning at break of day, each fair lady was awakened by a song,\r\nbidding her arise and eclipse the sun; and, as he awoke, and gave life\r\nto the flowers and fruits of the earth, so must she spread her benign\r\ninfluence over the hearts of men. The guests assembled in the hall of\r\nthe castle, which was hung with festoons of evergreens and flowers; and,\r\nas they sat, an invisible concert was played, and, between the pauses of\r\nthe music, a strain of rich melody broke upon the air, that by its\r\nunrivalled sweetness betrayed that the singer was Ildone, who, thus\r\nconcealed, could wrap the soul in Elysium, while his presence must have\r\ndestroyed the enchantment.\r\n\r\nAfter the music, they were conducted to a small amphitheatre,\r\nconstructed on the little green platform before the castle, where they\r\nwere amused by the tricks of the jugglers, sleight of hand, fire-eating,\r\nrope-dancing, and every prank that has been known from the shores of the\r\nGanges to those of the Thames, from the most distant periods, even down\r\nto our own times. After these had displayed their arts, a number of the\r\npeasantry of Valperga presented themselves to run at the ring. Three\r\npieces of cloth, and two of silk, the prizes for the various games,\r\nstreamed from the props that supported the amphitheatre. Two poles were\r\nerected, and a string was attached to these, on which were strung three\r\nrings. A peasant on horseback, with his lance in rest, galloped past in\r\na line parallel to the string, endeavouring to catch the three rings on\r\nthe point of his lance; the first, second and third failed,--the fourth\r\nwas more successful; he caught the three rings, and bore off the piece\r\nof scarlet-cloth as his prize. A wrestling match succeeded, a foot-race,\r\nand then a horse-race; the prizes were distributed by Borsiere; and\r\nthen, it being noon, the company adjourned to their mid-day meal.\r\n\r\nIt were needless to enumerate the dainties that made their appearance;\r\nBorsiere resolved that the feast neither of the preceding, nor of the\r\ntwo following days, should exceed his; and, having been often regaled at\r\nthe tables of the most luxurious princes of Europe, he now displayed the\r\nskill that he had there acquired, in the directions he gave to the ruder\r\ncooks of Euthanasia. When every one had satisfied his appetite, the\r\nconversation flagged, and the eyes of the ladies wandered round in\r\nsearch of new amusement. Borsiere appeared at the head of his party;\r\nBergamino, Guarino, Ildone and a score others of less fame came forward;\r\nwhile Andreuccio edged in sideways, neither choosing to join, nor be\r\nleft out, of the company. Advancing in a courteous manner, Borsiere\r\nintreated the company to follow him: they all rose, each lady attended\r\nby her cavalier. Borsiere had been bred at courts, and knew how to\r\nmarshal them with the science of a seneschal; as they quitted the hall,\r\nthey, as by magic, fell each into his proper place, and every noble dame\r\nfelt that neither could she have preceded the person before her, nor\r\nwould she have gone behind the one who followed her. Thus, in courtly\r\nguise, they proceeded through several passages of the castle, till they\r\nquitted it by a small postern; the rocky face of the mountain rose, as I\r\nhave already said, immediately behind the castle, and almost overhung\r\nthe battlements; but this postern opened on the little winding staircase\r\nI have before mentioned, that, cut in the rock, enabled them to scale\r\nthe precipice; they ascended therefore, and before they could feel\r\nfatigued, they came to a small platform of turf-covered rock, which\r\nBorsiere had prepared for their accommodation, The fountain, that gushed\r\nfrom a cleft, trickled down with a gentle murmur, and filled the basin\r\nprepared to receive it with its clear and sparkling liquid. This\r\nfountain had, like many other springs of those mountains, peculiar\r\nqualities: in summer it was icy cold, and in winter it became warmer and\r\nwarmer as the temperature of the air decreased, until on the frosty\r\nmornings of December it smoked in its passage down the rock. To preserve\r\nthe waters of this basin from the rains, Euthanasia had, as already\r\nmentioned, built an alcove over it, supported by small columns; this was\r\na favourite retreat of our young mountain-nymph; and Borsiere had\r\nadorned it for the occasion with a master's hand. The boughs of the\r\ntrees were bent down, and fastened to the rock, or to the roof of the\r\nalcove, and then, being interlaced with other boughs, formed a web on\r\nwhich he wove a sky of flowers, which shut out the sun's rays, and,\r\nagitated by the gentlest airs, cast forth the most delicate scents: the\r\nartificer of the bower had despoiled an hundred gardens to decorate only\r\nthe floor of the platform, forming a thousand antic devices with the\r\npetals of various flowers. Anemones, narcissi, daffodils, hyacinths,\r\nlilies of the valley, and the earliest roses, had all lent their hues,\r\nmaking a brief mosaic of these lovely and fragile materials; and the\r\nwhite columns of the alcove shone in the midst of this splendid shew in\r\nelegant simplicity. Seats were placed round in a semicircle for the\r\ncompany; from hence they could behold the whole country; the platform\r\nwas so high, that it surmounted the battlements of the castle, and they\r\nviewed the entire plain of Lucca, its defiles and woody hills, and the\r\nclear Serchio that loitered on its way across it. An exclamation of\r\ndelight burst from all lips, as they entered this flowery paradise,\r\nwhere every gay colour of nature was heaped about in rich and lovely\r\nprofusion, while the deep green of the ilex trees, the soft and fan-like\r\nfoliage of the acacia, mingled with the shining foliage of the laurel,\r\nbay and myrtle, relieved the eye from any glare of colours. The joyous\r\ncompany sat down; and Borsiere, coming forward, announced, that he and\r\nhis companions were ready to present the assembly with their songs and\r\ntales; Euthanasia accepted the offer in the name of her guests; and\r\nGuarino first shewed himself: that he should be the first to attract the\r\nattention of the noble guests had been the bribe which won him to forget\r\nhis hoarseness, and, having entered upon his task, there was no doubt\r\nthat his vanity would induce him to exert his utmost powers to surpass\r\nhis companions.\r\n\r\nHe sang extempore verses on the event of the late war with Florence,\r\nchanging his notes, from the hurry of battle, to the wailing for the\r\ndead, and then to the song of triumph, whose thrilling melody\r\ntransported the hearers with admiration. Then, leaving this high theme,\r\nhe described himself as Dante descending to hell; but, as he had\r\nventured thither without a guide, rude Charon had refused him a passage,\r\nand he only saw the wandering ghosts of those recently dead, and some\r\nfew who bewailed their unburied bones, as they flitted about the dreary\r\ncoast. Here he found Manfred, who, addressing him, told him that he was\r\nnow paying, and hereafter would more painfully pay, the deadly penalty\r\nfor his many crimes--\"Well did they for me, and benignly,\" he cried,\r\n\"who cast my bones from their unhallowed sepulchre; for now I wander\r\nhere untormented; but, when the cycle of an hundred years is fulfilled,\r\nand I pass that dark river, fire and torture await me, dire punishment\r\nfor my resistance to the Holy Father.\" And then continuing, he sent a\r\nmessage to his friends on earth, bidding them repent; and Guarino\r\nintroduced into this the bitter gall of his sharp and cruel satire\r\nagainst his enemies. He ended; and small applause followed, for he had\r\noffended many who were present by his strictures, and few could\r\nsympathize in the deep malignity of his anathemas.\r\n\r\nHe was followed by the story-tellers, who repeated various anecdotes and\r\ntales which they had collected in their rambles; they seldom invented a\r\nnew story; but an old one well told, or some real occurrence dressed up\r\nwith romantic ornaments, formed the subjects of their narratives.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: See Boccaccio: _Giornata_ I. _Novella_ 8.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\n_Euthanasia's Court continued.--Pepi arrives._\r\n\r\n\r\nCastruccio had not joined the amusements of the day; for he had returned\r\nto Lucca, and assembled his council to deliberate on some knotty\r\nquestion in the Lucchese policy. Having dispatched this weighty affair,\r\nhe mounted his horse, and turned his head the accustomed road to the\r\ncastle of Valperga. As he quitted the gate of the town, he heard a voice\r\nbehind calling him; and, reining in his horse, he saw approach at a\r\ntremendously high trot, Benedetto the Rich of Cremona. Although at some\r\ndistance he instantly recognized his old fellow-traveller, by his\r\nuncouth dress which was still unchanged, his high shoulders, strait back\r\nand bent in knees. Pepi, approaching with a humble salutation, said that\r\nhe had affairs of importance to communicate to the noble consul of\r\nLucca, and intreated him to give him audience.\r\n\r\n\"Willingly,\" said Castruccio: \"I am going to ride to yonder castle; do\r\nyou accompany me; we will discourse on the way; and when there you will\r\nfind hospitality as well as I.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must check your steed then,\" said Pepi, \"for mine will hardly\r\ngallop after the hard day's journey he has had.\"\r\n\r\nThey rode on together, and Pepi seemed oppressed by a weighty secret,\r\nwhich he longed, yet did not know how, to disclose. He praised the\r\nfortifications of Lucca, the fertility of its plain, and its mountains,\r\nthose inexpensive barriers against the incursions of enemies; and then\r\nhe paused,--coughed,--scolded his horse,--and sunk into silence.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" asked Castruccio, \"what is this affair of importance\r\nconcerning which you would speak to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! _Messer lo Console_, it is a matter of such consequence that I\r\nhardly know how to disclose it; and methinks you are in too merry a mood\r\nto listen with requisite attention, so for the present I will waive the\r\nsubject.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you please; but, when we arrive at yonder castle, we shall find\r\nlittle opportunity to talk of business; for amusement and gaiety are\r\nthere the order of the day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gaiety!--Well; it perhaps will do my heart good to see merry faces once\r\nagain; I have seen few of them since you were on the donjon of my\r\npalace. Cremona has not yet recovered its cruel siege and storm; many of\r\nits palaces still lie in their ashes; and many good and fertile acres\r\nhave been sold at a low rate, to trim the despoiled apartments in the\r\nguise they once were. Yet the Guelphs have again attained the upper hand\r\nthere; my townsmen are proud and rebellious, and have not acquired\r\nthrough their misfortunes the humility of poverty, which sits better on\r\na subject than the insolence of prosperity. Were I a prince, all my\r\nsubjects should be poor; it makes them obedient towards their master,\r\nand daring towards their foes, on whose spoils they depend for riches.\r\nYet, alas! so obstinate is man in his wickedness, that, as we see in\r\nCremona, famine, fire and slaughter cannot tame their factious spirits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Messer Benedetto, you are ever the same; you have neither changed\r\nyour dress nor opinions since I saw you last; ever immersed in\r\npolitics.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, my good lord, I am fuller of those than ever, and that of\r\nnecessity; as, when you hear what I have to say, you will perceive. Ah!\r\nthe Cremonese are still proud, though they ought to be humble; yet a\r\nsmall power might now easily overcome them, for they are thinking more\r\nhow to replant their burnt vineyards, than to resist their lawful\r\nprince. Sovereigns make war in a strangely expensive way, when they\r\ncollect armies and man fleets against a country: a dozen bold fellows\r\nwith fire-brands, when all the town is asleep in their beds, will do as\r\nwell to the full, as an hundred thousand armed men by broad day-light: a\r\nwell timed burning of harvests is a better chastiser of rebels, than an\r\narmy headed by all the sovereigns of Europe. I was ever an admirer of\r\nthe Hebrew warrior who sent foxes with torches to their tails among the\r\nenemy's corn; these are sleights of war that are much neglected, but\r\nwhich are of inestimable benefit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Messer Benedetto, I listen with admiration to your wisdom; but trust\r\nthe word of a friend, and do not talk thus openly in yonder castle; or\r\nif you cannot rein your tongue now, turn your horse's head towards\r\nLucca. They are Guelphs up here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange company for me to enter; for in Cremona I never cap to a\r\nGuelph, whoever he may be; but if you, my lord, are safe, surely so am\r\nI, and trust Benedetto Pepi for discretion. You are I believe my friend,\r\nand a Ghibeline; and, being now lord of this noble country, you can well\r\njudge of the truth of my remarks. As it is I am glad to enter the\r\ncompany of Guelphs, and glad to find that you are well with them; for it\r\nis always expedient to have a spy in the enemy's camp.\"\r\n\r\nIf Castruccio had not fully understood the eccentric mood of his\r\ncompanion, he might have been offended at this speech; and even now he\r\nfelt his cheek flush at the name of spy being thus as it were applied to\r\nhim; but he replied laughing; \"Aye, Messer Benedetto, there will be fine\r\nsport for you; the lady of the castle is holding a court, and to-morrow\r\nwe have a tournament; will you not enter the lists against these\r\npriest-ridden knights?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the less powerful for being priest-ridden; not the less powerful if\r\nthey were priests themselves; as I well know to my misfortune, having\r\nbeen beaten almost to death by a young canon who was my enemy; and that\r\ntook place many years ago, when I was younger, and more active than I am\r\nnow. But I was revenged; aye, Benedetto Pepi was never yet injured in a\r\nhair of his head, but the heart's anguish of his enemy paid for it.\"\r\n\r\nPepi looked at his companion with the elevated brows of triumph and\r\nvanity, while his sharp eyes spoke, not ferocity, but successful\r\ncunning. Castruccio regarded him with a glance of distrust, which he did\r\nnot observe, but continued:--\"This young rascal had been forced into the\r\npriestly dress, but had not yet made vows, when he resolved to supplant\r\nme with a rich, young heiress whom I intended to marry. I was well off\r\nin the world, with a good estate, and a noble palace, so the father gave\r\nhis consent, and all went on prosperously; till this roguish priest laid\r\na plot for my destruction. He waylaid me on the wedding day, as I was\r\nconducting the bride to my own house; she loved him, and left me; aye,\r\nat the first whistle of this brave dame-hunter I felt her snatch her\r\nhand from mine, and saw her throw herself into his arms. I resisted,\r\nmore as an angry, than a wise man, for they were armed, and I\r\ndefenceless: so, as I told you, the villain beat me, till I was carried\r\nhome nearly dead from the blows I received. During my recovery, as I lay\r\nthere in my bed, my bones aching with the bruises I had received, I\r\nformed my plan of revenge, which I carried on, till he and she, and his\r\nkin and her kin, knelt to me for mercy; but I did not bend, and was most\r\ngloriously revenged. And now where is he? a grey-haired wretch; old\r\nbefore his time, rotting in the dungeons of the Inquisition. She has\r\nlong been dead; of grief, they say,--at least she never enjoyed a moment\r\nwith her paramour.\"\r\n\r\nCastruccio started, as he heard the devilish confession of his\r\ncompanion. He did not reply; but he no longer felt that careless\r\namusement which he had formerly done, in his conversation and uncouth\r\nmanners; but watched him warily as if he had been an old and wrinkled\r\nserpent, whose fangs had fallen to decay, but whose venom still lurked\r\nin his toothless gums.\r\n\r\nPepi rode on, unconscious of the emotions he had excited; he imagined\r\nthat he had just recited the finest passage of his life. For this old\r\ncraftsman was folly impregnated with the Italian policy, which has\r\nstained the history of her lords and princes with the foul blots of\r\nfraud and cruelty: he did not admire the conqueror of a nation (although\r\nthat were almost an object of adoration to him), so much as he\r\nworshipped the contriver of frauds, the base intriguer, who, not by the\r\nopen combat of power and passion, but by dastardly and underhand means,\r\nbrings his enemy on his knees before him.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the castle, they were conducted to the fountain of\r\nthe rock, and Castruccio introduced Pepi to the company. The Cremonese\r\nbowed to the fair countess; and then darted his quick glances around, to\r\ndiscover if he knew any of the company; many he had seen before, and he\r\ncould not help muttering as he seated himself--\"Guelphs to the core! a\r\npretty nest of hornets this!\"\r\n\r\nThe company in the mean time were examining with curious eyes the garb\r\nand manners of their visitor. His dress was more shabby than that of the\r\npoorest of the jugglers; for he had not brought his gold-fringed cloak\r\nwith him on this occasion; and, but for the introduction of Castruccio,\r\nand the gold spurs which he wore, he would have hazarded the disgrace of\r\nbeing dismissed to the company of the valets of the castle. Pepi\r\nobserved their contempt, and addressed them as follows.\r\n\r\n\"For you, noble lords and ladies, who with upturned lips sneer at my\r\nhomely garb, listen to my story, and do not despise my words, because\r\nthey are those of a Ghibeline. You shine in silk, and jewels, and costly\r\nfurs; I am clothed in sheep-skin and sclavina, and perhaps my capuchin\r\nmay have a hole in its well worn texture; but look at my golden spurs; I\r\nam a knight, and have a palace, and a tower, and a good horse, as an\r\nItalian nobleman should have. Now listen, and then tell me whether I am\r\nright or wrong, in not throwing away the produce of my fields in\r\ntrinkets and trumpery.\r\n\r\n\"I dare say that you all know, that there was once an emperor of the\r\nWest, called Charlemagne. He was a great conqueror, and during his life\r\nlorded it nobly over all Europe, even from the tepid waters of the\r\nMediterranean to the frozen Baltic sea; Italy did not murmur against his\r\nsway, and Germany was obliged to submit to the force of his arms. It was\r\na glorious thing to see this great prince ride out among his followers,\r\nclothed, as I may be, in common skins, and greater than the meanest\r\nsoldier in his camp only through his superior prowess and wisdom. But\r\nthe nobles of his court were such as the nobles have continued to be to\r\nthis day; and the money they should have kept for the maintenance of\r\ntheir followers, and the furniture and works of war, they expended upon\r\ndress and foppery.\r\n\r\n\"One day Charlemagne was at the town of Fugolano, clothed as I have said\r\nin a well worn vest of fox's fur, and his only jewel the well-tempered\r\nblade of his trusty sword. The courtiers gathered round this royal\r\neagle, and he was indignant at heart to view their tawdry attire: they\r\nhad just come from Pavia, which place, then as now, the Venetians made\r\nthe mart for all the rich merchandize they brought from the East. They\r\nwere dressed with every extravagance of luxury; they wore tippets of the\r\nfeathers of Ph\u0153nician birds, lined with silk; robes of rich brocade,\r\ntrimmed with the feathers of the back and neck of peacocks. Their\r\nflowing cloaks of fur were made of the skins of a thousand minute\r\nanimals, brought from the wilds of Tartary, and in their caps they had\r\njewels and feathers of extraordinary price. Thus they jutted up and down\r\nbefore their master, fancying that he would admire them, he who loved a\r\nwell hacked helmet, boots bespattered with riding after fugitive\r\nenemies, a blood-stained sword, and a spirited war horse, more than ten\r\narmies of such fair-weather birds. 'Come, my brave comrades,' cried the\r\nemperor, 'we have no battle and no siege to amuse us; and the gloomy day\r\nwith its drizzling rain makes the quiet of my palace irksome to me;\r\nmount your steeds and let us away to the chase.'\r\n\r\n\"It had been a fine sight, to see the courtiers, as they gave a last\r\npitying glance to their gay dresses, and bestrode their horses to follow\r\ntheir master. He led the way; no ditch or hedge or thick cover of\r\ncopse-wood, could obstruct his path; his noble steed surmounted all, and\r\nevery bramble had rich spoils from his companions: silk, fur, and\r\nfeathers strewed the ground, and hung on the thorns by the roadside;\r\nwhat escaped the dangers of land, was shipwrecked by water, for the rain\r\nwetted them to the skin, and the materials of their clothes, in losing\r\ntheir gloss, had lost all their value.\r\n\r\n\"When they returned, they bitterly complained among themselves for the\r\nlosses they had sustained: the emperor was advised of their murmurs, and\r\nsent to command their attendance. They obeyed, and approached his throne\r\nin a guise much unlike the gay figure they had exhibited in the morning;\r\ntheir feathers broken, their jewels lost, their silk torn, and their\r\nfurs, which had been wet, and afterwards dried by the fire, were shrunk,\r\ndisfigured and spoiled. 'Oh, most foolish mortals!' cried Charlemage,\r\n'how are these furs precious or useful? Mine cost only a few pence;\r\nyours cost not only silver, but many pounds of gold!'\"\r\n\r\nPepi ended his most apposite tale by a laugh of triumph; and it might\r\neasily be perceived that some of the young nobles were by no means\r\npleased with the uncouth manners of their teacher. But the sun had now\r\nset, and the bell of the _Ave Maria_ rung from the chapel of Valperga;\r\nso the company descended the rock, and joined in the devotions of the\r\npriest, who celebrated vespers, attended by all the more humble guests\r\nof the castle.\r\n\r\nIn the evening several mimes were represented under the direction of\r\nBorsiere. No nation can excel the Italians in the expression of passion\r\nby the language of gesture alone, or in the talent of extemporarily\r\ngiving words to a series of action which they intend to represent; even\r\nin those ruder times they were able to draw tears from the audience, or\r\nshake them with convulsions of laughter. The actors now at the castle,\r\nfirst performed the touching story of Palamon and Arcite, and afterwards\r\nthe favourite tale of the loves of Troilus and Cressida, and told with\r\nanimated action the story of the ill repaid constancy of the worthy\r\nknight of Troy, and the black treachery of the faithless Cressida; so\r\nthat few eyes were undimmed with tears, when this unhappy knight, who\r\nhad sought death in vain, but who survived his country and his friends,\r\nwas supposed to stand beside the half choked cistern of a once often\r\nvisited fountain among the ruins and burnt palaces of Troy, and to\r\nbehold Cressida, in a mean garb, and deformed by disease, bearing a\r\nheavy pitcher on her head, come to draw water from the spring; and every\r\nbosom thrilled at the bitter grief of Troilus, and the humble repentance\r\nand heart-felt self-reproaches of his once wanton mistress, as, calling\r\nfor pardon, she died. To relieve the company from their painful\r\nsympathy, the mimes came forward to act the antic pantomimes of the day:\r\nthese were neither very decent nor very clever; a miller and a priest\r\nwere over-reached in their love, and were left shivering in the snow\r\nduring a winter-night, while two young students of Bologna, whom the\r\nother worthies had combined to trick, enjoyed that for which in their\r\ndreary condition they ardently pined. Night had now run half its course;\r\nand the company retired, after bestowing the praises well due to\r\nBorsiere's successful exertions.\r\n\r\nThe next morning before daylight Castruccio heard some one enter his\r\napartment. It was Pepi, who approached his bed, and said: \"My lord, I\r\ncome to take my leave of you. After what passed last night, you may well\r\nbelieve that the young countess would rather not count me among her\r\nguests. I am about to return to Cremona, but would first ask you,\r\nwhether you would not prefer that a staunch friend of yours should be\r\nlord of that town, than that it should remain in the hands of the\r\npeople, who have become Guelphs and traitors, body and soul?\"\r\n\r\nCastruccio's thoughts instantly fixed on Galeazzo Visconti, or Cane\r\ndella Scala, as the promised lord of Cremona; and he replied eagerly:\r\n\"Messer Benedetto, you would do me an inestimable benefit, if by any\r\nmeans, either in your power, or with which you are acquainted, you could\r\nplace the government of your town in the hands of one of my friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"And are you prepared to assist in such an undertaking?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now I cannot; but I have promised to be in Lombardy at the end of the\r\nmonth of July. In August I will visit you at Cremona; and, if you will\r\ndisclose to me the contrivers and instruments of this change,--\"\r\n\r\n\"Now I can tell you nothing. Come to me on the fifteenth of August,\r\nalone, or with but one attendant; but come not with the shew of a\r\nprince; on that day, at five o'clock in the evening, you will meet a\r\nperson on the bridge of the rivulet you cross about half a mile from\r\nCremona; say to him the word, Lucca, and he will conduct you to my\r\npalace by an obscure way, and then I will disclose every thing to you.\r\nAs you may not be able to command your time to a day, I will wait for\r\nyou one month, until the fifteenth of September; then if you do not\r\nappear, the enterprise must proceed by other means. During this interval\r\npromise me inviolable secrecy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, may I not tell----?\"\r\n\r\n\"No living soul must hear of this--If you impart that with which I have\r\nintrusted you, my plan must instantly fail. I trust to your discretion.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is well, Messer Benedetto,\" replied Castruccio, recalling to mind\r\nthe impressions of the preceding evening, and gazing on his companion\r\nwith distrust: \"I do not clearly understand your plans, and cannot\r\npromise to assist in them; but I assure you of my secrecy, and that you\r\nshall see me before the fifteenth of September.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am satisfied; farewel. The stars are disappearing, and I would reach\r\nyour town before sunrise.\"\r\n\r\nPepi departed with a brow of care; while every heart in the castle of\r\nValperga was light, and every countenance expressed gaiety. This was the\r\nthird day of the court, the day for which a tournament had been\r\nproclaimed. But it would be tedious to dilate on the remainder of these\r\nceremonies, and from what has been related a judgement may be formed of\r\nthose which were yet to come.\r\n\r\nThe summer months passed on, and the time approached when Castruccio had\r\npromised Galeazzo Visconti to meet him at Rovigo. Euthanasia desired\r\nduring the autumn to revisit her native city, from which she had been\r\nlong absent. They agreed to journey thither together; and on\r\nCastruccio's return from Lombardy their long delayed marriage was to\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Valperga Volume 1 (of 3), by \r\nMary Wollstonecraft Shelley\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK VALPERGA VOLUME 1 (OF 3) ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 63337-0.txt or 63337-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/6/3/3/3/63337/\r\n\r\nProduced by Amanda Fish and Laura Natal Rodrigues at Free\r\nLiterature (Images generously made available by The Internet\r\nArchive.)\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n"
